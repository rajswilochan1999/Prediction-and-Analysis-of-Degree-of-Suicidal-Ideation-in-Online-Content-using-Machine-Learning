###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

I'm turning 36 soon. All I ever wanted was to be a mother and have a husband who actually loved and respected me. I don't think that will happen now.

I got divorced a couple years ago from a much older husband who lied about wanting children and wasted 7 years of my life pretending that ""next year"" we'll have kids, despite it being a sexless marriage for the last 5 of those years. I put up with it because i was financially dependent on him and I moved to his country when we married and had no easy way to pick up the pieces and return home.

I did meet the person that I thought was my soulmate a couple years ago, though. Yet again, in another country. I had to return to where I was living and due to visa issues and then border closures, we have not seen each other since. We planned to get married, but now when I talk about making my way back to his country, he acts like he doesn't really want me to come. I don't think our relationship will last and he's everything to me. Everything that I do that I care about is tied up with him. All my hopes and dreams for the future are tied up with him.

On my own, I have nothing. I have no way to support myself. No real job experience , qualifications, or professional contacts. I spent my adult life basically being a housewife, hoping to have babies and stay home and take care of them. 

I have no close friends. My family is useless. They know what I've been going through and don't even ask if there is anything they can do to help. They made it clear that I couldn't stay with them.

I'm trying to make my way back to the US because the lockdowns in my current country are so bad and making my mental health worse. They've taken away everything I enjoyed doing. I don't even leave my flat anymore. I might have to leave my cat behind because I'm having so much trouble finding a pet transport company that can take him and it's so expensive. I'm rapidly running out of savings and I have to go soon or I won't be able to afford to move at all. It breaks my heart to think about rehoming him. He's been my only friend for years.

&lt;p&gt;She passed away. It&amp;#39;s been 4 days. I eat and sleep as usual, like nothing ever happened. I&amp;#39;ve told no one about it and her family doesn&amp;#39;t even know about my existence. But I know there&amp;#39;s something deep inside me, waiting to burst out, and I don&amp;#39;t know if I can take it when it comes. I should have called the police, right? She might still be alive if I had called someone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

There's a note it's pretty long and my mother threw it in the trash but i was able to read it. It basically says that he can't fit in anywhere even in his own family, that he doesn't know if he have a purpose in live, and that he was a burden to me and our mom who's a single mother. Today my mom doesn't mention him at all because she doesn't have any time to think about it. The reason why I'm writing this is because i feel that same way that he felt and i think I'm going to commit suicide. Maybe tomorrow or maybe even next year but i think i will do it no matter what happens.

,SuicideWatch,"I was raised in a very religious household and went to a seventh day adventist school until my junior year of high school. I was bullied for years by both teachers and students for what I recently found out was asperger's syndrome. They said that I was the worst student they'd ever seen and that I should pray about it. The worst thing was when I questioned a Bible verse that I thought was sexist, the teacher didn't explain a thing and threw me under the bus. A rumor that I was a misogynistic asshole spread around the whole school and every girl, literally every single girl (it was a small high school) shunned me, flipped me off, got their boyfriends to intimidate me, they even barred me from entering the music building to get my trombone to practice.

Public school was great but then I went to college. I fell in love with a girl way too fast and she said that I was too clingy and instead of just breaking up with me she cheats on me. The guy she was cheating with (my fraternity brother who took me in during the break up) takes things too far when she called it off, drugs her and date rapes her. It was just terrible she left a week later and I never heard from her again. I tried to keep going to college but I just kept failing due to depression and missing class. I wasted so much of my parents money trying to keep going on. 

Eventually they took me back home and I went to culinary school. I immediately fell for a girl in my class, we were super close knit and hung out with our friends for a year. But I was so far in my depression that I felt less adequate the more I fell for her and I started missing classes and eventually dropped out to avoid her. 

I just want someone that I chose to love love me back, but when I find someone, my trauma with women prevents me from being able to even talk to girls these days. 

I'm 26 now and have been suicidal since I was 13. I spend half my time focusing on wanting to live and the rest either hating myself or drowning my problems in video games, d&amp;d and weed. I never have enough time to work on making myself into the person I want to be so I can confidently find the person for me. Hell I don't even know what that version of me even is anymore because I find current gender politics and representation so confusing (I feel weird and guilty just looking at a girl because I don't want her to think I'm a creep who's checking her out.) It's tearing me apart from the inside and with this goddamn pandemic I can't even find a therapist. I've been thinking more and more about suicide the older and more frustrated I become.

I've craved the release of death for more than half of my life. I have tried many medications and therapies within my economic range and sustained the will to continue them, but as the pandemic rages on and the funds dry up, I am really starting to feel the futility of life.

&lt;p&gt;Fuck them. Fuck all of them. They&amp;#39;d rather let me rot away and show up as a performative socialite from time to time than actually let me express my own will and desire. I don&amp;#39;t want to be this suffering beast any more- I want the humane ending that I deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I wanted to create and leave some indelible mark but even that seems like a fruitless endeavor in an oversaturated marketplace of stressed apes. I just want out. I want to get off of Mr. Bones&amp;#39; Wild Ride. I&amp;#39;m done. To that end, I bought a shotgun for &amp;#39;home defense,&amp;#39; and it will soon defend me from having to deal with the collapse of human civilization and scatter the home of my wretched consciousness into a nearby body of water.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Like I might sound inhuman and cruel but I’m just displaying my thought, I’m 14 and yes I’m still very young according to everyone and I might sound like some random kid talk but pls listen to me.
As a 10 yrs old, ppl around me always talk abt how much deaths are such a bad thing, and how my grandpa past away and stuff like that. And at some point my thought just became well... weird? I just stare at his picture for a long time and I just thought abt how he must have felt when he died (since he got cancer) and he died so he was free from all the pain, isn’t that a good thing? Ppl just wanting him to live longer while being under all those medicines and machines just so his family can be happy but he have to be like that? The 10 yrs old me just simply turn to my mom and my grandma thinking “How selfish” 
When I turn 11, I learned abt how overpopulated the world is and how human are ruining the planet, then I read abt murderer and ppl talking abt how much precious human life is. But when I look at them shoving a knife into an alive pig and taking it organs out while it screaming in pain until it died, I just thought “What is the difference? Human just a bunch of meat just like how everything is, everything die at the end so why does one live matter more?” Imagine the position were reverse, pigs holding knife surrounding one human, shoving it in the stomach taking everything out until it died then cook it and eat it while everyone is smiling and happily chatting. I honestly felt so sick in front of that, I was 11 yrs old and the adults even ask if I wanted to have a try at draining the blood and I was horrified. I ask them “Can you do it if that was a human?” and they were mad for some unknown reason, I honestly don’t understand. They all look like demons to me while calling me the demon and the weird one. 
Soon I turned 12 then I thought “Oh maybe I should die since the world is growing and I hate human either way and I’m a human so I should kill myself! Isn’t that such a good thing omg I’m so smart” and I told my mom abt my future plan which is that expecting her to call me a good child thinking abt the world but then she slap me and said I was crazy. I still don’t understand, why? Why are ppl so scare of death? Is it because they doesn’t know what beyond it? Is it because it painful? Is it because it a bad thing cuz everyone think it a bad thing? I don’t understand, that so strange. Doesn’t ppl get curious if they doesn’t know what beyond it? Yet why are they scare of it? That’s odd. Maybe I should stay for sometimes so I find out why, so I decide to change the date up a bit. I search the web, ask ppl but it still doesn’t make sense, I don’t understand their logic. What is the point of growing up, go to primary school, high school, uni then graduate, grab a job, marry, have kids, then die? The whole world live like that and they all are not bored of it. From my point of view, everyone seem like a bunch of sheep in a farm waiting for their death. They might be happy, they might be sad but honestly does it all matter at the end? U gain nothing from it so why don’t they just go and explore the afterlife? Even if someone died, there still be tons and billions left. Our family might be sad, but they won’t after some times, they will move on. And think of you only when they are depressed and want something to chew on. That just how it is. 
13 yrs old me trying to find a good spot for a good jump yet everything is block off? Why? Why are they complaining abt world population and human cruelty yet they doesn’t let us to cleanse our sin by death? Why does everyone smile and think they are heroes when helping ppl who are near death? For example, doctors, some ppl might want to live but some don’t, some of them have to sit in bed waiting for death since their brain are dead but yet ppl around them doesn’t let them die. That’s cruel. Human like to break, and break and replace and fix just like a robots, having an artificial heart in you, are you still human? We are fated to die at some point, yet ppl are trying to stop that, call yourself heroes or what it is. All I see is hypocrites dancing in the world so call “common sense” I might be crazy. I might be odd. I might be Satan itself. I might not a human. Call me what you want. But I still don’t understand, just why? I feel sorry for all those animals that everyone ate until they die at 100 yrs old or 80 yrs old or whatever age it may be. How many animals, how many lives have u ate to get to that point? Human live longer than any animals and are cruel than anything out there, yet some are labelled as “innocent” while chewing flesh in their mouth? That’s odd. I wonder what happen if those flesh were something else... Why does “murderer” only work for those that killed human? What is the difference between human and monkey? The power to destroy everything? The so-call great brain? Top of food chain? Educated? Yet so ugly and selfish on the inside? They smile but they might not be smiling, they love you but might call it obsession and interests more than love. They care? But it probably benefit them at some point, fame, wealth, how does they look to others, world common sense, etc... 
And I’m 14 now, looking at churches scare me, thinking abt witch hunts scare me, thinking abt what might be on the other side of that smiling face scare me. I’m might as well gone to the wrong place. How many things are happening in the world that u do not know of? Someone might be raped right this moment, someone might have pass away next moment, animals are being roasted alive this moment. And no one know. No one care. Everyone want to be the hero, but how abt being a hero to urself first? 
I want to die. I don’t bare any grudge in particular. I just don’t understand. My common sense are weird according to others.

,SuicideWatch,"Like is there really any point?

**I'm 5""1, and 19-years old.**

On top of that I have terrible social skills, zero confidence (for obvious reasons), barely any friends, never had a job, never had a girlfriend, virgin, never been to a party. I feel incompetent, because I literally look like a 9-year old.  I'm certain that I have undiagnosed ADHD, depression, and anxiety for obvious reasons.

I also have eczema, asthma, atopic dermatitis (my scalp and eyebrows itch), Hyperhidrosis, thyroid issues, and a plethora of food and environmental allergies.

I struggle with hygiene, because I have phimosis (a tight foreskin) and a tight frenulum so my foreskin can barely retract. I try my best to clean down there thoroughly, but it can smell quite unpleasant at times. My hair gets greasy so fucking quickly, and my feet start to smell quickly.

I'm not exactly ugly, because I do take care of myself, but I would be viewed as ugly by society. I have features that compliment each other, my skin is for the most part clear, I have high cheekbones, a chiseled jawline, a haircut that looks good. However, my head is small, I have big eyes, a big nose with a hump, and big lips. I also look horrible when I smile with my teeth showing so avoid doing that. **I've had some girls interested in me, but i've always been too scared to approach them in fear of fucking it up. I don't even want a girlfriend let alone a family anyway. My family is toxic enough, and I really fucking love being alone with no one to bother me. My constant mind-chatter, brain fog and depersonalisation are enough thanks... I don't know how any woman would actually want me, but I do not want to inflict such suffering onto another human. Fuck no, I never want to have kids. Why would you want to lie to an innocent child about how the world is all sunshine and rainbows, and when they grow up they see how sick and disgusting this hellhole of a planet is.**

**I'm sure a lot of you will agree with me on that one, cause I'm sure you've seen some shit way worse than me.**

It seems like all of my problems stem from being ugly and short. Could be worse though, but it doesn't make my suffering any better.

Sure, there are things that I can do to improve my life, but my life will still fucking suck. I know what I need to do to improve my life, and there are so many things that I want to do, but it just seems pointless. I hate the course i'm doing at college, I'm pretty much forced to work at my family's store because I live with them, and they literally dictate my life. I moved across the country, so I don't even see my friends anymore.

I just feel weak and like an alien. Seriously, when you're dealt a shitty hand, it doesn't get better.

I see people complain about being 'short' and they're 5""6, like that is not fucking short. Try being barely 5 foot. I can literally lose in a fight to an 8-year old.

If you were born attractive in the eyes of society, then count yourself fucking lucky. Life just seems like endless suffering if you're not born attractive, talented, or born into a rich family. It's just a genetic lottery. You also have to grovel and work a shitty 9-5 for the rest of your life until you die. I drift into a fantasy world and I tend to dream about being this ideal version of myself with the appearance that I would've loved to have, and living the life that I will likely never be able to live.

Reality hits, and i'm back to myself again... If you're an ugly short man nobody gives a fuck about you. When people say ""what you see on Instagram is a facade"", yeah right, because the people I see on Instagram (who aren't even models) women and men, are attractive and are enjoying their lives. Partying, travelling and constantly updating their stories. Stop trying to make me feel better. **I feel inferior to just about everyone, including women.** **I was the tiniest and lightest baby (in terms of weight), and I still weigh like 40kg now no matter what I eat.**

I don't even want to work a normal job (as I have ADHD, doing something that doesn't interest me is torture, and my life already feels like torture), **I have big dreams of being a singer or even a social media star, but i'm not good-looking or talented enough for any of that. I feel like i'm destined to be a wage slave, or even unemployed because I have zero employability skills.** I'm struggling in college too, because of ADHD and Depression. Everyday feels like groundhog day nowadays, and I feel like I have nothing to live for, and even if I do it's not something that will make me happy. I don't even remember what it feels like to be normal, I was such a happy kid, but now I just feel like i'm suffering. It's odd how we get so existential when the day ends, but as soon as we wake up it's a new day and we're somehow strong enough to get through another day of suffering on auto-pilot. **I'm not funny, i'm not talented, i'm not smart, i'm not attractive, and i will not be remembered...**

I hear people my age talking about partying, travelling, doing all sorts of stuff, but I do absolutely nothing.

I understand that people care, but please stop telling us to not follow through on our suicidal ideations. We all have our own struggles, and it's not as simple as getting help especially when you literally have no one to turn to, and we're still in a pandemic.

I'm not actually planning on killing myself, but I really would if it didn't mean hurting my family and the very small circle of friends that I have. I keep telling myself that it will get better if I follow-through on my plans, but if anyone here has ADHD and Depression, you know it fucking sucks. What a meaningless existence this is...

I realise that time is the most valuable resource in life, and that experiences and relationships are the most valuable things, but I can't have any of those things. I have zero accomplishments, zero memorable experiences.

I probably missed some stuff, but you get the picture, and I don't see it getting better. I'm just lying to myself to feel better at this point...

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edit:** I also fucking hate my voice. I'm pretty certain I have inattentive ADHD and I can't even sit down for 5 seconds to do any college work (even watch a lecture, or open a linked resource) without wanting to stick my head in a blender. If you don't think I have it, or i'm exaggerating i'll give you a long list of symptoms I have to deal with everyday along with suicidal thoughts. I'm also procrastinating on an assignment right now, that's due in a few days, and I don't think it will get done anytime soon since I can't even get started. I can't open anything college related and it doesn't help that everything is online. I literally feel like smashing my head on my keyboard, zone out and say i'll do it tomorrow, and then repeat.

If any of my friends met me now, they would probably not want to be friends with me and would probably think i'm weird, because I would have absolutely nothing to say.

The list of ADHD symptoms I promised if you think i'm just using it is an excuse or if you think it doesn't exist. It doesn't help when you also hate yourself:

**The symptoms that I experience (As a kid I was hyperactive, so I feel like it may be a combination of both, or my hyperactivity is no longer physical but mental):**

* Heavy mental fog (blocked mind, it's like I have a wall stopping me from thinking)
* Mental clutter (overwhelmed by thoughts)
* I feel like I can't apply any of the knowledge that I have (I feel like I have a lot of wisdom and accumulated knowledge of philosophical shit, but none of it really matters)
* I'm scatter-brained (I jump from one thing to another, and thoughts just randomly pop into my head so I struggle to formulate sentences)
* I feel like i'm trying 100x harder than everyone else, but it's all mental work and I still appear lazy on the outside.
* Depersonalisation (disconnected from the present moment, reality, from myself)
* Stuck in my head (racing thoughts, feel like i'm at war with myself)
* Everything feels overwhelming even the most simplest tasks
* I avoid anything that requires sustained mental effort
* I can't follow-through on anything (I make so many plans, have bullet journals, I have 'potential')
* I can't do anything that is boring or that I have zero interest in, it feels like torture..
* I'm a chronic procrastinator (now or not now)
* I can't 'try harder' I just shut-down and give up as soon as I open anything up, and just feel like smashing my head on my keyboard
* I can say things impulsively that I don't mean because I'm very irritable
* I can't cope with stress
* I'm moody a lot of the time, but that's because of stress
* I'm very disorganised
* I appear to be lazy, but I'm always fantasising and thinking about doing things that I know I should be doing.
* Excessive talking (I finish sentences for other people, I have poor working memory so I try to say things as soon as possible before I forget them, I think quicker than I speak and come up with random shit)
* I appear to be listening, but i'm really just staring at your eyes and constantly repeating what I was going to say before I forget it, or I think of something completely unrelated.
* High or low in mood (mood swings, it's like i'm bipolar, my mood is so unpredictable, but it's internal so no one really sees it and I appear normal)
* I'm very forgetful (I sometimes even forget to flush lol, I also forget to eat a lot of the time)
* I feel like i'm motivated, but I don't at the same time. I also feel like I'm smart, but also stupid, because every time I try to do something I capitulate.
* I overlook details (I hate reading, and just look for the bold text, or skim through everything and overlook details, and then forget what I just read. The same goes for watching YouTube videos, I have to rewind a lot because I missed something)
* I make careless mistakes (probably made some grammatical errors here)
* I don't feel in control of my life (brain fog, follow-through, mind-chatter, it's like someone else has the remote control to my life)
* Hyperfocus on pointless things, and end up getting sucked into a rabbit hole.
* Time blindness
* I want to do everything, but end up doing nothing...
* Extremely low motivation (but it seems like I have the necessary motivation, and I just can't do the thing. I've always thought that it was a clarity issue, but i'm an over-planner.)
* I'm very irritable and can't control my emotions (I had a punching bag when I was younger, but nowadays I prefer to journal how I feel and cry in private if I'm sad)
* I'm extremely sensitive to noise (I get internally angry, and can't concentrate)
* Can't focus on anything that doesn't interest me
* I hate asking for help (I don't really know why)
* I hate being told what to do (I don't know if that's an ADHD thing, but I hate authority, but need external pressure or I get nothing done).
* Easily confused
* Excessive daydreaming
* Sensitive to criticism
* I give up and get discouraged easily, because I find things to be mentally draining.
* When I have labs at college, I will squirm in my seat, tap my feet, fidget and even think that it's time to leave when i've only been there for an hour. I pull out my phone and watch YouTube videos when I should be doing the work, because it's so tedious, boring, and I can't concentrate.
* I'm so easily distracted by my surroundings and my own thoughts.
* I tap my pen a lot, and itch my hands or bite my thumb if I don't have anything to fidget with (i have eczema)
* I have strong interests, I'm creative, and i'm very motivated to succeed in my own endeavours but I can't ever get started or complete anything that I start.
* Can't hold conversations (my mind just goes blank), struggle to maintain friendships.
* Obsessively do the same things over and over again like watch the same YouTube videos, movies, listen to the same podcasts. (it's like i'm trying to reinforce something that I already know, because I feel like I didn't fully process it, or I'm not applying it)
* I make notes about my entire life just so I can understand how to tackle the future, and have some form of control, because everything else seems to be falling apart.

**I probably missed some, but it was the same in high school. I feel like the only thing that could improve my life is an ADHD diagnosis at this point...**

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m 5&amp;quot;1, and 19-years old.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that I have terrible social skills, zero confidence (for obvious reasons), barely any friends, never had a job, never had a girlfriend, virgin, never been to a party. I feel incompetent, because I literally look like a 9-year old.  I&amp;#39;m certain that I have undiagnosed ADHD, depression, and anxiety for obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have eczema, asthma, atopic dermatitis (my scalp and eyebrows itch), Hyperhidrosis, thyroid issues, and a plethora of food and environmental allergies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I struggle with hygiene, because I have phimosis (a tight foreskin) and a tight frenulum so my foreskin can barely retract. I try my best to clean down there thoroughly, but it can smell quite unpleasant at times. My hair gets greasy so fucking quickly, and my feet start to smell quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not exactly ugly, because I do take care of myself, but I would be viewed as ugly by society. I have features that compliment each other, my skin is for the most part clear, I have high cheekbones, a chiseled jawline, a haircut that looks good. However, my head is small, I have big eyes, a big nose with a hump, and big lips. I also look horrible when I smile with my teeth showing so avoid doing that. &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had some girls interested in me, but i&amp;#39;ve always been too scared to approach them in fear of fucking it up. I don&amp;#39;t even want a girlfriend let alone a family anyway. My family is toxic enough, and I really fucking love being alone with no one to bother me. My constant mind-chatter, brain fog and depersonalisation are enough thanks... I don&amp;#39;t know how any woman would actually want me, but I do not want to inflict such suffering onto another human. Fuck no, I never want to have kids. Why would you want to lie to an innocent child about how the world is all sunshine and rainbows, and when they grow up they see how sick and disgusting this hellhole of a planet is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure a lot of you will agree with me on that one, cause I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ve seen some shit way worse than me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems like all of my problems stem from being ugly and short. Could be worse though, but it doesn&amp;#39;t make my suffering any better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, there are things that I can do to improve my life, but my life will still fucking suck. I know what I need to do to improve my life, and there are so many things that I want to do, but it just seems pointless. I hate the course i&amp;#39;m doing at college, I&amp;#39;m pretty much forced to work at my family&amp;#39;s store because I live with them, and they literally dictate my life. I moved across the country, so I don&amp;#39;t even see my friends anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

 I have OCD and I’m on the autism spectrum. There’s no hope for me with completely recovering from OCD. I can’t stop the intrusive thoughts in this life, so I hope that I don’t have them in Heaven.

I’ll make sure to tell your brother you said hi for you. I’ll be looking out for you in Heaven, if there is an afterlife. You’re the most, strongest person I’ve ever known. You been through so much, yet you’re still here. I love you, and please stay strong. If not for you, please do it for me. 

 I’m so sorry Daddy. I love you and Im grateful for everything you did for me and Rico. I’m so sorry for being such a fucking brat when I was little. I’m so sorry for giving you such a hard time. I love you. 

 To Rico, you’re the best big brother anyone could ever ask for. I’m so sorry that I did this. I love you so much. I’m sorry for being annoying sometimes. I’m so sorry for doing this. I love you.

 To my pets Doozer, Blueberry and Neru. I love you all. I’m sorry that I couldn’t pet you as much as I did when I was little, Doozer. Contamination OCD wouldn’t let me. I know that isn’t an excuse, but it’s a reason. Blueberry, you’re the best bird anyone could ask for. I’m sorry. And Neru, I know I didn’t have you for very long, but I’m sorry. You’re a good hamster, and you’re very sweet. I’m sorry. I love you all. 

 To my characters in my unfinished book, I’m sorry I didn’t get to finish your story. Even though I was the one that wrote you all into existence, you taught me so much. Hell, even the villain, Dr. Green taught me a few things. I’m so sorry your story will stay unfinished forever. 

I wish I could write one last poem or story, but I don’t even have the motivation to do that. I’m probably going to do this either this evening or tonight. I haven’t decided yet.

 Here’s my will. 

 I want almost everything that can be donated to go to charity. This includes clothes, old toys, books, etc. I want my handmade dolls to go to Mommy, Daddy, and Rico. I want my notebook full of poems to go to Mommy. I wish to be dressed in my short dark blue dress for my funeral with my hair in a bun. I would like everyone to wear what they like at my funeral, even if it’s not black. If it is possible, please read one of my more happier stories or poems at my funeral. I don’t have the motivation to write another story or poem, but I wish to tell one more story even when I’m gone. If it’s possible, please read my stories to kids at the local library or something. Like I said, I still wish to tell stories even when I’m dead. Even if they’re my old stories.

I have severe acne and I feel hopeless. From about half way through high school my acne worsened, i had a friend group and I still do but I never fully considered them friends. Its hard to explain but people don't look at you the same, you feel the same as everyone else but I could tell I didn't fit in. No matter who i was with i would always feel alone, i would also struggle with conversation as I would always be in my head. I wouldn't finish or want to finish what I was saying because I would feel as if people didn't want to hear me talk. I hated school towards the end, I didn't attend graduation, formal, or any school events. After school finished \[about a year ago now\] i got into drugs, not hard drugs just marijuana, lsd, and occasionally dmt. I just needed an escape i guess. besides the point i feel as if the drugs helped, I don't live near town and just live with my father who is old now. I never have someone to talk to, so when my father would go to sleep i would just get high and talk to myself. recently i started going to gym again and have had some crazy progress, i have an excellent understanding of nutrition and bodybuilding, its my passion, i am well above average build and people would compliment me on photos but it would make no difference. Acne is just a deal breaker, nobody will ever get close enough to me or ever see past the skin, its just how humans are. Also to everyone that will give advice like go talk to friends and do things that make you happy, that's the thing, acne just doesn't work that way. All I want to do is hide, all my mind can think about is how i need to stay home, hide, and fix myself before I can go out and socialise and be normal again. But i have no clue how long that will be, its not getting better and I don't know when it will. \[I am on a non dairy diet and using proper acne medication btw\] Anyway point being I feel as if all I'm doing is wasting time hiding trying to fix myself, but now I'm even more depressed because I'm wasting my life. every time I go out or try to socialise I just remind myself of how I need to be fixed. 2 of my good friends have committed suicide and I know for a fact I'm next, I just cant do it right now, I couldn't do that to my dad, it would destroy him, a father should never have to burry his son. My life currently is just a mess and I wish I could end it all with no repercussions, I currently have 2 options. wait until my life is fixed and there is a turnaround, or wait until my father passes away so he wont have to deal with my death. It sounds depressing and dark I know, but it is what it is, some people are just different I guess.

like theres nothing soo bad going on in my life that makes me want to end it. its more what happened in the past

that is so irrational but its true

Well look and think logically they didn't give a damn when you were happy before. They just don't care. But ask yourself if they don't care why should you care if they care or not?

But the strangest thing is that I miss people. I haven't seen any of my friends in 7 months, and when I last saw them we thought we would be gone for just 3 weeks. I want the company of someone here. Not romantically, not sexually, just someone who I can hang out with. Someone I can hug comfortably and someone who I can talk to without the conversation just being pleasantries for hours on end.

&lt;p&gt;So why do I still feel so sad? And so empty? Why is the thought of ending it all so... there. I&amp;#39;m 18, in a beautiful place in a good university. But for some reason I can&amp;#39;t handle the idea that I have to school-related work for 10 hours a day every day for 4 years, followed by the some 40 years of 8 hour shifts in the office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to cut it short, live a short life but at least it will be one where I can remember a few good things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have changed since I met my closest friends. I&amp;#39;m depressed now. Hopelessly depressed. I don&amp;#39;t have the energy to eat some days, but I force myself to because I can&amp;#39;t let depressive habits start to take over my life. I force myself to get out and about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the strangest thing is that I miss people. I haven&amp;#39;t seen any of my friends in 7 months, and when I last saw them we thought we would be gone for just 3 weeks. I want the company of someone here. Not romantically, not sexually, just someone who I can hang out with. Someone I can hug comfortably and someone who I can talk to without the conversation just being pleasantries for hours on end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t remember how to make friends, but I need someone. Just a hand to hold and a shoulder to cry on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s going to get worse if this keeps going. I know it. I just want to end it all&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Its important you guys know the backstory 1st. In middle school I met this girl. We soon became very close and became best friends and at one point we considered each other brother and sister. I had family issues at the time and was suicidal but she was there for me through most of it we would red each other back and fourth. She was there for me when I started cutting myself she was there for my on my 1st suicide attempt and I loved her more then anything on earth I would carry her stuff for her and comfort her when she went through a break up or was upset. I made a promise not to kill myself and to live for her sake as I cared about her so much I saw her as more then enough reason to live I loved her as if she was my sister.

Then high school came around and that's when it all fell apart. She started getting really agitated with me for no reason would just ignore me when she was around certain people and would try her best to avoid me. I would try to talk to her but she would just snap at me whenever I tried to talk to her about it. Finally after 3 months of putting up with the BS I just went off yelling at her the confrontation ended with me storming off that's all it was nothing more just yelling.

The rest of the school year was just pure hell as she had told everyone I was mentally abusing her and that I had her by the throat against the lockers. Because of this I was bullied both verbally and physically one time I was cornered in the boys bathroom and was beaten against the stall by one of her friends. I would constantly be insulted and made to feel guilty about shit I didn't even do to her. At one point she lied saying I tried to sexually assault her and the police got involved but they dropped the charges when they found out she was lying of course no punishment was given to her.

It got to the point were I had to stay in class talking with the teachers who were the only ones who knew what was really going on after class and wait for everyone to pass in the hall as I was so scared of being beaten up or confronted. My now ex girlfriend broke up with me because she believed te girl over me. I had to switch schools the next year because I just couldn't deal with it any more I even attempted to overdoes on sleeping pills because of her.

But the torture continued as afterwards I was so traumatized by the incident that I developed PTSD over the situation if her name was even mentioned it would feel like my stomach would sink to the ground. I would also have panic attacks and mental breakdowns whenever I saw her again as even tho I changed school we still lived in the same general area. One time I was confronted by her boyfriend and he punched me in the face causing me to fall to the ground in the parking lot of the grocery store this was a year after the incident at that point. My own mother even said I couldn't be mad at her as since she was a girl in her own words ""I don't care what she did to you shes a women"" I wish I was joking. 2 years later and ive ran into her in public a few more times each time causes my PTSD and anxiety to act up causing me to go into a full blown panic attack. 2 years later and I'm still suffering from PTSD anxiety and severe depression from the incident. I recently downloaded discord but I signed into a old account and found the DMs my ex broke up with me with. This was enough to send me into a anxiety so bad I felt like I was gonna pass out me being an idiot reread all of them from start to end.

,SuicideWatch,"This is the fourth time rewriting this. Sorry if it gets long.

I wrote notes to my two best friends, a gorgeous and kind person who’s totally selfless and everyone loves her, and a person who always makes me feel so valid and who I can laugh with and relate to on so many levels who’s so proud of themselves and I can’t help but be proud of them too. My older brother who relies on me to fix all his problems because he has a guilty conscious and thinks he’s bad, my favorite cousin who’s like a sister to me and who I want to have all my books, and my little cousin who I love so much, she’s my little buddy and I’ll miss her a lot. Also my childhood best friend because I feel like I have to even though our relationship at this point is pretty one sided.

I still have to write to my parents and my principal. Im not close with her, I just want to let her know that I wasn’t bullied and it wasn’t because of anyone at the school. It kind of is about kids at school, but not bullying. They just dont really acknowledge me anymore. I’m never anyone’s first choice. Even my best friends have other best friends they love and know better than me. It sucks.

I started rambling, sorry. I’m also writing one to my therapist just to say it’s not her fault and she shouldn’t feel like she could’ve helped me, because I didn’t give her a chance to. She doesn’t think I’m suicidal anymore, she doesn’t know I started cutting again. When we first met I had started my clean streak. I was at seven months when I relasped. I feel worthless because of that. Among other things.

Sorry if it gets long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote notes to my two best friends, a gorgeous and kind person who’s totally selfless and everyone loves her, and a person who always makes me feel so valid and who I can laugh with and relate to on so many levels who’s so proud of themselves and I can’t help but be proud of them too. My older brother who relies on me to fix all his problems because he has a guilty conscious and thinks he’s bad, my favorite cousin who’s like a sister to me and who I want to have all my books, and my little cousin who I love so much, she’s my little buddy and I’ll miss her a lot. Also my childhood best friend because I feel like I have to even though our relationship at this point is pretty one sided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have to write to my parents and my principal. Im not close with her, I just want to let her know that I wasn’t bullied and it wasn’t because of anyone at the school. It kind of is about kids at school, but not bullying. They just dont really acknowledge me anymore. I’m never anyone’s first choice. Even my best friends have other best friends they love and know better than me. It sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started rambling, sorry. I’m also writing one to my therapist just to say it’s not her fault and she shouldn’t feel like she could’ve helped me, because I didn’t give her a chance to. She doesn’t think I’m suicidal anymore, she doesn’t know I started cutting again. When we first met I had started my clean streak. I was at seven months when I relasped. I feel worthless because of that. Among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’ll tell my mom if I open up to her about these things, so right now we just talk about my loneliness and my depression and anxiety. She’s bringing me some papers from her hospital at our next session about making friends to try and help me. She’s trying her best.&lt;/p&gt;

It's loneliness and indifference. It always seems you are not alone, there're so many people surrounding you, every day you meet a lot of people that don't even know you, but in fact, you always are alone. It looks like the world is endless, pitch-black, ice-cold, silent space and we, people, are tiny, lonely starlights. Some people create a constellation, but even then this icy, silent darkness surrounds us, supresses and crushes us, because it is so huge and we are so tiny.   
From down here, you can also see how easily other people could resolve other people's problems. The problem may be unsolveable for you, but someone else could end it in a minute. Some guy kills himself over not having any friends - but some other person could just spend 3-4 hours talking to this guy, find out this guy is actually really interesting and reliable, and make a good friend, and no life would be ended. Another one has no chance to graduate a university - but he or she can be truly genius who just needs a chance, a help, and then he or she can literally change the world to be better. Third one has a huge debt with no hope to pay it off, but some other guy may spend this sum in one hour just hanging out, so the guy's whole life costed just one hour of fun of another guy.   
I've been in depression and despair, surrounded only by huge problems, for 3 years. Damn I even asked the Pope for help lol (no reply obviously). This is my shout into nothing, into emptiness. Maybe someone will hear and at least read this for his/hers own thoughts.

I don't know why my head has started to think this now of all times but here we go. 

I started thinking that ya know... with everything thats happened to me, wtf is the point anymore? Is it even bad? 

I don't serve a purpose in life honestly. I'm not important and I certainly don't and haven't had a great impact on anyone here. 
Im not really the smartest so there's nothing I can do there. 
My life hasn't been good and has only been filled of trauma, sadness. endless nights of loneliness, being trapped, no love (mainly physically, ex: hugs) the past, PTSD, self harm, and more. 
I've already tortured myself and my body to breaking points and so have other people. 
My only purpose in life has been to please others if that's sexually or emotionally and thats all its ever been since I was 13.
Suicide is not too bad the more I think about my life and how's it's been but then again, I don't have anymore memories of happiness from my past to help me as I've forgotten them all. 

**Lil thoughts that don't help: **

I started thinking more and wondering if I'll ever be able to get out of this house too but due to my mom and brother that seem unlikely. I've never spent more then 10 minutes outside. I've never been able to walk along the street to release some stress. I've never been able to just sit outside due to her not letting me because we live in the middle of nowhere. 

I wouldn't mind help and honestly I had a plan to do so once I get a job and a car but hell, I don't even know when thats coming. 

I tried therapy once but my mom was ALWAYS in the fucking room and sometimes even talked for me as if she knew what I was going through. I don't care if she meant it out of good will, it was awful and did nothing but hurt me more. So the thought of therapy makes me ill

This is the third day I've thought about all of this now and I've already started self harming a bit. Wonder what I'll do next. 

I'm not fucking happy, not in the slightest. I don't take my meds, I don't have help, I don't have someone who is here with me, I don't have anyone who understands to help... I don't have fucking anything. God dammit.

&lt;p&gt;I started thinking that ya know... with everything thats happened to me, wtf is the point anymore? Is it even bad? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t serve a purpose in life honestly. I&amp;#39;m not important and I certainly don&amp;#39;t and haven&amp;#39;t had a great impact on anyone here. 
Im not really the smartest so there&amp;#39;s nothing I can do there. 
My life hasn&amp;#39;t been good and has only been filled of trauma, sadness. endless nights of loneliness, being trapped, no love (mainly physically, ex: hugs) the past, PTSD, self harm, and more. 
I&amp;#39;ve already tortured myself and my body to breaking points and so have other people. 
My only purpose in life has been to please others if that&amp;#39;s sexually or emotionally and thats all its ever been since I was 13.
Suicide is not too bad the more I think about my life and how&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been but then again, I don&amp;#39;t have anymore memories of happiness from my past to help me as I&amp;#39;ve forgotten them all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Lil thoughts that don&amp;#39;t help: *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started thinking more and wondering if I&amp;#39;ll ever be able to get out of this house too but due to my mom and brother that seem unlikely. I&amp;#39;ve never spent more then 10 minutes outside. I&amp;#39;ve never been able to walk along the street to release some stress. I&amp;#39;ve never been able to just sit outside due to her not letting me because we live in the middle of nowhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind help and honestly I had a plan to do so once I get a job and a car but hell, I don&amp;#39;t even know when thats coming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried therapy once but my mom was ALWAYS in the fucking room and sometimes even talked for me as if she knew what I was going through. I don&amp;#39;t care if she meant it out of good will, it was awful and did nothing but hurt me more. So the thought of therapy makes me ill&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the third day I&amp;#39;ve thought about all of this now and I&amp;#39;ve already started self harming a bit. Wonder what I&amp;#39;ll do next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not fucking happy, not in the slightest. I don&amp;#39;t take my meds, I don&amp;#39;t have help, I don&amp;#39;t have someone who is here with me, I don&amp;#39;t have anyone who understands to help... I don&amp;#39;t have fucking anything. God dammit. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 39 year old male.  Life hasn't been all that great.  I was born early, 29 weeks or so and I had complications in the form of a stroke which made interacting with people more complicated than it should have been.  Physical therapy for years etc.  I was that kid that didn't quite fit in, bullying started early.  Pushed down flights of concrete stairs, mass beat downs at recess, chased and run over by older kids on bikes.  Mental, physical emotional and later on sexual abuse from non relatives.  Add in a family history of depression, brain damage, PTSD and the like.  Life was never enjoyable, I've never felt happy or much of anything honestly.  Been in therapy for decades now, medicine after medicine with no real effect.  I exist but I'm not really alive.

&amp;#x200B;

3 years ago I got leukemia, out of nowhere and with no family history.  It was made clear early on I would need a bone marrow/Stem Cell Transplant.  They are the same thing just with very slight differences.  I begged my parents I don't want to get treated, I don't want the transplant.  I wanted to be done.  It wouldn't be a particularly great death but it would all be over.  The self hate, the sadness, the numbness it would all stop.   My mother begged and pleaded for me to try, she promised I would have this great life afterwards.  So I gave in.

&amp;#x200B;

Chemo was easy, didn't get sick from it, didn't feel bad.  I threw up maybe 5 times that was it and that wasn't until the 3rd round of chemo.  A few weeks after the transplant a complication came up.  GVHD.  Leukemia causes your immune system to fail.  You basically become an AIDS patient, infection kills you.  With a transplant you kill off your broken immune system and get a new one.  It's an immune system transplant.  With GVHD the new immune system attacks you.  There's no way of knowing if it will happen, or why.  There's no cure, just quasi management of the symptoms and that causes its own issues.

&amp;#x200B;

It destroyed my eyes, I can no longer produce tears or lubricate my eyes.  I am on a good half dozen eye medications ranging from drops/ointments/pills.  One of the treatments is steroids, which gave me bone damage and cataracts, which I had one operated on, the other considered inoperable.  So I have one eye with the cataract that can see close, the other set is for distance.  I tried to get glasses so I could use the operated eye but I was told my eyes are too damaged to get a prescription.  Pretty bad light sensitivity.  I sit in the dark most of the day.  Light is uncomfortable.  Contrast especially.  I loved to read but I can't stand to look at the white pages of a book anymore

&amp;#x200B;

I loved exercise, boxing/crossfit/group classes, running tough mudders.  I've lost 60% of my lung function.  I struggle to climb a flight of stairs now.  The only way I could ever regain a physical life style is a lung transplant.  I hooked up a heavy bag I could bang around and started to see flashing lights and shadows.  The damage to my eyes from treatment has resulted in the gel in my eyes which hold things in place to begin to deteriorate.  So any activity that is impactful can lead to retinal detachment so I had to stop that.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a photographer, landscape/fine art.  The kind nobody really cares about, but I good at it, I liked it..I can't operate the camera anymore, I can't see the readouts or the controls and not to mention with the economy blown up everyone is focused on survival, not on something pretty.

&amp;#x200B;

I never had real friends to speak of.  When I started exercising and doing OCR races I found a group which seemed to like me.  They were there for me in the beginning when I was sick but when it became clear that I wasn't going to be magically be better, everyone started to disappear.  People I've known for half a decade plus just vanished.  Don't respond to messages.  I've had to live with my parents for the past 3 years, I will always have to live with them when they die.  Nursing home I suppose, some kind of assisted living thing.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've had to live a Covid existence for the past 3 years, that will always be the case.  I will never walk the streets of Chicago again or go camping or skydive or go inside a gym, or read a book or live on my own.  

The world isn't meant for people who are sick.  People don't like people who are sick.  It makes them uncomfortable, so they pull away.  I've been left alone to deal with my illness.  Then my mother got diagnosed with skin cancer.  Now my father has cancer, and I'm left to deal with all of this by myself.  I tried support groups but there are none for GVHD.  It's a rare condition.  I tried normal cancer groups but told I shouldn't come back because I didn't fit in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I found a euthanasia clinic in Switzerland.  You don't need to be terminal, just a reduced quality of life.  I talked to them, I qualify but due to Covid they aren't allowing people in.  Who knows when that will change..if ever.  If I had that option available that I could say..enough and I could just disappear.  But my mother demands I live so she doesn't have to feel bad.  She's admitted that this was a failure but I must endure to keep her happy.   I've thought about stepping in front of a train or a truck but I don't want to cause a problem and ruin some persons day..so I don't go that route.  Since my last visit to the hospital I'm now looking at some form of thyroid cancer and surgery.  I'm tired.  I'm very vulnerable to pneumonia.  Dying from illness will be less painful for my parents then finding me hanging from something.  So I plan to gradually put myself more and more at risk to try and get myself sick enough that I cannot recover.  There used to be an abandoned factory about 30 miles away in the woods.

I was already feeling worse than usual for whatever reason. Sometimes it just happens. But then I learned that All-State band, choir and orchestra results came out for my state. I used to have dreams of making All-State, but they were dashed after I got braces which messed up my trumpet playing. So one of my friends said how she was so excited to get into All-State choir, so I told them about my dreams of making it and how they were dashed. A few minutes later, her sister talks in a different group and says that people should congratulate my friend. I started to talk about my All-State dreams again, since these were different people, and I wanted them to know how they impacted me, but she cut me off and said ""OP, please, not right now.

I don't know why, but that hit me really hard. I immediately blocked that person, and self-harmed, worse than I ever have before.

I feel disgust towards my own being. 

No one cares about anyone. Everyone always places themselves first. Everyone borns together and dies alone. It's very cruel that we have to watch our own life-giver die. 

I think life is black comedy. Every time something stabilizes is when a rugpull is about to happen. It gets ready for war, while we're at peace with it. Life shows no mercy. No one ever ""gives up"" yet everyone always loses. Staying alive forever is an even worse scenario. We just can't win. 

There is no meaning to our suffering or to anything. No one ever witnessed any real proof that we're meant to be everything or nothing at all. Life is not real, is just a theory created by ourselves to pretend that we're somewhere while we are nowhere to be found. It's science fiction. No one likes life. It's just a terrifying downward spiral for everyone.

Suicide is an escape and a shortcut to the background world beyond the forth wall. We can choose to die and end this right here and now.

Just like for most people, 2020 has been one of of the worst years of my life but not because of covid but because of an assortment of things. In March my grandma was diagnosed with ALS, and 3 months later she died. I’ve never dealt with an immediate family member death so it hit me pretty hard. I miss her so much and I think about her all the time, and I feel so guilty for not spending enough time with her. I used to go to her house every day when I was younger, but as I got older I started to become more and more distant because I was becoming more and more depressed. But now she’s gone and I can never tell her I love you again, or bake with her, or anything. She’s just gone. Like what the actual fuck. How does someone get diagnosed with ALS and then die 3 months later!?!? I thought it was supposed to be at least a year. I thought she was going to see me finish this semester of school, but nope, nothing. Anything I do now she will never know and that hurts to think about. ALS has taken so many lives in my family and my dad has a 50% of getting it, so with my luck he will also probably die from ALS.

I also just lost all the money that I have been saving to buy my dream camera. I’ve been working 30 hours almost every week for the past few years to pay off medical bills, to pay for school , and to just live while going to school full time. I’ve been working so hard and I’m physically and mentally exhausted. I finally saved enough money to buy a decent camera only to get scammed... 

I honestly don’t even know how to process it. I got scammed Tuesday and I haven’t been able to think about anything other than that or suicide for the past few days. I have been a screaming crying mess because I am just so fucking hurt and I feel so dumb for letting this happen. I was so excited to get this camera, and I thought it was going to be a turning point in my life. All my years of hard work for absolutely nothing. I just can’t believe the money is gone and I have nothing to show for... 

I was also supposed to go back home to Colorado recently to celebrate my little sister’s bday. I haven’t seen her in a year and I really miss her. She was so excited to see me but my boss denied my vacation request. I’m just so hurt because my sister invited everyone in her class to come to her bday party and no one showed up. I can only imagine the pain she went through to have no friends celebrate the one day out of the year that’s supposed to be happy and stress free. I’m so hurt for her because I know exactly what it’s like to have no-one show up. I wouldn’t want to wish that feeling on anyone. It sucks not having anyone to talk all day every day. It sucks when you try to fit in but everyone just views as the weird kid. I have no friends at work and no friends at school. It’s just me, my cats, and the suicidal thoughts 24/7.

,SuicideWatch,"Ever since I was a child, I've had a stutter. Not a mild one, think of the Kings Speech; that one hits closer to home.

I spent my school life listening to everyone chat, laugh, sing, whisper, but could never do it myself. I would sit in the classroom, at my allocated spot at the table hearing questions being thrown out to the room which I knew the answer to; and beyond all other wanting in that moment, all I craved was to raise my hand and answer it like a normal school boy would.

I just couldn't.

Instead I would sit there within my impenetrable silent bubble I'd found myself in, and daydream of a future where I would become an adult and have a happy life, my stutter non-existent. 

Ten years later I'm an adult with a medicore job, with some great friends of whom I'm very lucky to have. My family, friends, and colleagues all know of my affliction, but as they do not have one themselves, all they see is someone with a mundane speech impediment who needs a little longer to ""get his words out"". 

They, and I assume most people who can speak fluently and articulatory without hindrance don't understand or realise the mental and emotional turmoil it can create.  In this day and age everything is based around communication. Want to apply for a job? Sit down for an hour in front of two people and answer questions on you why you want to spend your free precious time filling up the cheeses on aisle six for pennies.  Need cancel a subscribion? Buy a house? doctors appointment? Give them a ring only to have them hang up when they think that nobody is there because you can't say a simple ""Hello"". 

Or perhaps you want to go to the shops to buy a new coffee machine, when the nice lady walks up to you and asks you if you need any help today, completely unaware of the battle which is raging deep down inside of you. Struggling to breathe, facial contortions, colour shifting from milky white to beetroot red. Being so aware of every millisecond that passes, and just before the words come out finally, you realise that she is looking at you funny, with a hint of fear.

It's degrading. Humiliating. Demasculating. Knowing that I am of sound mind just trying to get by with life, but whenever I need to speak to someone, they think something is wrong in my head and avoid me. I go from the friendly looking chap standing by the toasters to someone they regret walking over to because I ""am not acting normal"". And worse of all? The hardest thing for me to say is ""stutter"". So I can't even tell people what's going on so they never realise.

Every waking hour of my life is dedicated to my stutter. It's always there looming behind every choice I make. It's an invisible disease, eating away at confidence from the inside out until a shallow husk remains; filled only with anxiety with lost dreams and opportunities. If this is to be my life, then it is not worth living. Watching peers around you progress and move up to a better life, when I can't even make a phone call without being hung up on.

Suicide has always been in a different reality to me. Seemed too far away or unrealistic to see it properly. However as time goes on I can only see a very bleak future for me in this life.

,SuicideWatch,"I've leaned on the suicide hotline many times in my life, and what I've realized is that most of the interactions feel artificial because they are. Things for the most part are scripted--or at least in a sense of ""I'm required to respond in this general manner, if said person exhibits such and such behavior."" You're met with that immediately. I'm not saying there aren't exceptions because gems exist in every field, but they are so few and far between. If we are being honest, a good portion of the volunteers, or even paid staff, are in it for generating the experience they need to put on a CV coupled with a letter of recommendation. I know this because I spent 7 months volunteering for one. People will adamantly post counter arguments or say things as callous as ""well you used the service and you're alive right?"" That's beside the point. I wouldn't be calling if I wanted to follow through my thoughts. I'm calling, just like so many others, because I want to have a genuine connection with someone, not to make a plan that no one who is seriously suicidal would fall back on. It isn't helpful, besides insulating you from meeting the person where they are emotionally at. That and making the company less liable. You leave the person more defeated than when they picked up the phone. 

There's this strange phenomenon that occurs among a select population of professional counselors: they feel after having obtained licensure and meeting all the training criteria, that they are less empathetic and equipped to help others in need. I feel this is somewhat applicable here: ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) strips you of your human element. There's an immeasurable perceptible component to empathy that can't be trained, and that's genuine responses. Of course each person is going to differ in how they connect with someone, or what they respond with, but how genuine they are is always being evaluated by something in us. I can't point directly to this intangible aspect of experience, but we all feel it to a certain extent. Now we could argue over the accuracy of how we evaluate others, but that's no really addressing what's happening on a call: there is a person in need, a person who feels isolated, and what they are longing for is some shared emotional space. They desperately want a connection. How often do we mirror their emotion? And I don't mean restating what they've said in different terms. I can do that all day, and have it be just as lifeless as a text lacking in tonality. We fall back on these methods for empathizing with others, and forget that sometimes the intuitive response will bridge that connection the person needs. The person needs another person, not perceived expertise. If two people are truly connecting there is a spontaneity in how each responds.

this shit sucks, being suicidal sucks. life fucking sucks. 

not too long ago i asked my mom, “what was the worst thing you’ve ever seen me do?” her response was “hearing you cry and talking about wanting to kill yourself at nine years old”. Little does she know that was the age of my first attempt... my brother walked in. for as long as i can remember I’ve been depressed. And I know that sounds basic and super stereotypical but I’m not playing .... as. long. as. i. can. remember.
I’ve never been treated for anything, we don’t have the money or insurance for therapy or meds. I just smoke to make myself feel better. But that’s starting to work against me and I can tell. 

I wake up sad, go to bed sad, get upset at myself for having little to no friends, get upset at myself for being so sad, get upset with myself for being so judge mental about my mind and body. My moods swing like crazy but GOD DAMN I’m always sad. It’s so fucking annoying. I don’t even know what it feels like to be happy, to be debt free, to not have to worry about the future. I wish I could just sit back and relax and be content with life but there’s nothing good about this life right now. My mom used to be who I turned to but she just got divorced (for the 3rd time) and picked up drinking again. She’s mean. She has no empathy. But, she’s also suicidal. That’s one thing her and I are on the same page about. Moral of the story: my suicidal alcoholic mother can’t help me with my mental health. I’m running out of options. And I know that because my intrusive thoughts have started to become way worse. Scripting lines of my suicide not in my head for minutes on end. Fantasizing about my mom finding me dead in a closet, and immediately collapsing into tears. How I’m going to do it.... what I’m going to do it with, who I’m going to say good bye to before hand. So many fucking thoughts. Unhealthy thoughts at that. 

Something that I feel separates me from the others is that I’m against suicide. To me it’s selfish, I could never, would never do that to my family. To let them down like that? To put my mom through that? ... at that point there’s be two deaths in the family within the same week. All that aside I can feel myself crumbling, I can feel myself starting to blur the lines between thinking about harming myself and planning on harming myself. Everyday it seems to become more of a reality. Closer and closer to death. 

I’m still here. And I plan on staying here. I WANT to live. I WANT to succeed. I WANT happiness. But they seem so far away, so out of touch. Forgotten years ago along with the rest of my child hood. My brain feels scrambled, this life feels scrambled. I just need somebody to reply with a morsel of advice or some encouraging thoughts. I yearn to hear how others feel about these kinds of things.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello, I'm a regular boy who lives in a regular small town in Sweden. I have spent my life in this town ever since I was born (only moved to another small town for studies). Time has seem to just rush me by the last couple of years. I have always felt like the world isn't ""real"" since I was about 8 years old. During my childhood I could get the most random and intense attacks of anxiety. I remember one day when I was watching television and the show that was on were describing how Earth would be evaporated if a big sized meteor hit our planet. I got so much anxiety of the tought of how easily life could just end. At that age I had an urge to live life to it's fullest and I could not in any way find a reason for someone to take their own life. I loved everything pretty much. I was very interested in fishing so that is how I spent my days back then. Taking my small ATV and drive to different locations and discovering new places to fish. I had a lot of friends in school even if the number of attending kids were low. 

When I was 15 I fell in love with a girl and we were going on and off. I got played really hard. She used me when no one else was around. I was starting to get more and more depressed. I don't blame people that has  been in my life for how I'm feeling. Pretty much everyone has a bad time during the ages between 15-20 because of puberty and a lot of other changes like school and work. For me what happened was that I lost my passion for fly-fishing and sports. I went fishing anyways but playing football and stuff like that was out of the picture. Even though I continued to go on fishing trips but I get so much anxiety when I'm away fishing. I have tried to talk myself into that one day the relaxing and happy feeling I got from fishing will come back but to this day I can say it hasn't returned. 

When I moved to another town for studies I started smoking weed and doing other drugs because that made me feel like I found what I once lost. Today I'm clean but I drink a lot on the weekends. 

I have been working out for the last 3 years with some breaks here and there to keep me in shape and keep staying positive. I try to think that the next day will be better but it never is. 

Anyways I graduated from school and got myself a job at the local sawmill in town. It's ape work, you push some buttons and you lift planks back and forth. It's decent money though and I have been working there for a little more than 2 years now. I can't understand how people can work for their entire life. I just can't. What's the point? I don't want to seem like a lazy ass so I keep going to work and do my business. When I go to bed on the week knowing I will have to go back to work I can't relax. I get so much anxiety and that keeps me awake at night. Which leads to me waking up tired af and going to a place I hate. 

I have never been this depressed and I do not know what to do. I don't really want to do anything besides cooking food, playing videogames and workout. Work really makes it hard to focus on these things when it brings so much anxiety.

I have started going to therapy and I have some medication I eat daily but I have not been able to notice any difference. 

I'm losing hope and my bad mod has been effecting my entire family. I feel like a problem because I'm the only one feeling this way in our family.

,SuicideWatch,"&amp;#x200B;

My whole life, the thought of death was a haunting idea and also in many ways, a relief…

A relief from life itself.

&amp;#x200B;

I would close my eyes and imagine or at least try to imagine nothingness. I would envision my residue of existence (after death) as a tiny dot surrounded by a vacuum of infinite darkness. 

That idea was never really frightening. I was more concerned about the way I would die and the pain I would endure before being delivered from the agony of living. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being younger i was somewhat aware that life would be just that, so i would ask god, the god that i was by some hazardous event born into, to remove me from this existence. I would hope by the age of 14. That didn't happen, therefore i asked again at the age of 17 and that didn't happen either.

Ironically I had matured, or so did I believe. In order to survive my teenage years I had fabricated a version of myself that would be admirable, but only by others. I never truly learned how to like myself due to that inner desire of being liked by others.

I had so many reasons not to. 

I would lie to make friends and then keep on lying and lying again to keep them. That is most exhausting, especially  when you have to keep track of all your lies and make sure you never contradict yourself. 

Some lies were made to protect me from judgement and many others were just because… I could lie.  

That is what gave me hope and not willing to die anymore. Sad, isn't it ? Bare with me, the best is yet to come. 

Then, I had what I most desired, friends,  I was friends with everyone and many wanted to be in my company. I had just become a “cool kid”. A reflection in a mirror casted by a shadow, a shadow without a physical body. An illusion, a fraud.

Putting it like this can seem that i was a victim, but in the end i was never truly that, i hated that idea. I did all I did with plain consciousness and the illusion of not being given a choice. I would tell myself repeatedly; “ lie to others but never to yourself” as it was some sort of inner wisdom or a moral compass that i should abide by.

Ironic, it is to realise that even in lies our brain tries to find something to grasp in order not to realise how deeply rotten we are. 

I spent my last few years drifting without a goal or a purpose, never really understood the concept of that anyway. Life goals, life purpose. 

Things to look forward to I would guess. 

The only thing I would ever look forward to, was dying before getting old. 30 or 35 seemed like a reasonable age.

The question here would not be why would anybody want to die so young but rather how could anybody have goals or a life purpose with such an expectation.

The answer is simple. I was not hoping to build a life nor have a life. 

By now it is easily understandable that everything that would follow would only be self sabotage in order to meet that expectation. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My relationship With god or lack thereof** 

&amp;#x200B;

I never really prayed because I couldn't understand the language. That resulted in a detachment from the principal of praying itself. Mostly I was too lazy to engage in the exercise. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did pray though, as a child, whenever i would be left alone in a dark room by myself or when i wanted something that i believed would only be possible through a miracle. The word miracle for me simply means being granted whatever i truly wanted, and for some reason, i always wanted the most expensive things from my parents to afford. It wasn't  really much, but the circumstances were not favorable financially speaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would also pray because my parents were very persistent about it. The idea i believe was more significant with a common saying in french :*” l'appétit vient en mangeant”* 

Am not even sure it makes sense to me in  this context but yet somehow it does… at least to their perspective. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe, am not sure, the idea of a loving god was introduced to me at the age of 14. That came as a shock because I was never presented with that image of god growing up. The message i would receive would only describe him as an omnipotent being that should be feared or else you would be doomed to hellfire for eternity.  

I had and still have so many questions about things in religion that I find incoherent, but back then, I was too afraid to ask, or maybe didn't care enough or didn't know enough to care. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was in fact doomed to that hellfire according to what I was told about the religion and even though by some miracle I managed to access heaven, it was clear to me that I had no interest in the 70 virgin women at my disposal, in one word, pervy, and if anything, everything else in there seemed so boring to me. 

I had to admit to myself that religion was not for me. I could only hope that at some point in life granted by some miracle again, I could find my way to it. 

Miracle, I overuse the word, for me, it means happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

I never described myself as an atheist and neither could i say i was a religious person for sure.

I think the idea of a creator would be a logical explanation for existence and life itself. I also think that humanity as i experienced it, is nothing like that god would be.

Our inerrant selfishness, cowardice and egotistical behaviour that translates in many aspects of religion is simply something that i can't make sense of when it comes to saying something as such : “we were made in god’s image” 

&amp;#x200B;

Selfish, coward, egocentric,.. 

I should know, I was both fluent and expert in the practice of those. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, somehow, I ended up being exactly the opposite of the above. Paradoxical.

I could never explain how that came to be. I could say that I finally accepted that I wasn't worthy of happiness. 

I told myself, if i can't experience things in life that could make me happy, i would participate in whichever way in making some other people happy in my stead. 

&amp;#x200B;

That became my religion in some ways. If my life has no meaning and we are all doomed to this misery, we owe it to each other to make our existence more bearable. 

The world is already full of despicable ignorants and self centred people. I would try my best to be one less.

&amp;#x200B;

I am no angel, i am no good, i am inherently bad but i can always try…

Am still not happy and recently started looking into ways to end my life the most effective way and less painful, but there's more to the story.

&lt;p&gt;My whole life, the thought of death was a haunting idea and also in many ways, a relief…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A relief from life itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would close my eyes and imagine or at least try to imagine nothingness. I would envision my residue of existence (after death) as a tiny dot surrounded by a vacuum of infinite darkness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That idea was never really frightening. I was more concerned about the way I would die and the pain I would endure before being delivered from the agony of living. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being younger i was somewhat aware that life would be just that, so i would ask god, the god that i was by some hazardous event born into, to remove me from this existence. I would hope by the age of 14. That didn&amp;#39;t happen, therefore i asked again at the age of 17 and that didn&amp;#39;t happen either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically I had matured, or so did I believe. In order to survive my teenage years I had fabricated a version of myself that would be admirable, but only by others. I never truly learned how to like myself due to that inner desire of being liked by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had so many reasons not to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would lie to make friends and then keep on lying and lying again to keep them. That is most exhausting, especially  when you have to keep track of all your lies and make sure you never contradict yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some lies were made to protect me from judgement and many others were just because… I could lie.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is what gave me hope and not willing to die anymore. Sad, isn&amp;#39;t it ? Bare with me, the best is yet to come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I had what I most desired, friends,  I was friends with everyone and many wanted to be in my company. I had just become a “cool kid”. A reflection in a mirror casted by a shadow, a shadow without a physical body. An illusion, a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting it like this can seem that i was a victim, but in the end i was never truly that, i hated that idea. I did all I did with plain consciousness and the illusion of not being given a choice. I would tell myself repeatedly; “ lie to others but never to yourself” as it was some sort of inner wisdom or a moral compass that i should abide by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironic, it is to realise that even in lies our brain tries to find something to grasp in order not to realise how deeply rotten we are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent my last few years drifting without a goal or a purpose, never really understood the concept of that anyway. Life goals, life purpose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things to look forward to I would guess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing I would ever look forward to, was dying before getting old. 30 or 35 seemed like a reasonable age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question here would not be why would anybody want to die so young but rather how could anybody have goals or a life purpose with such an expectation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple. I was not hoping to build a life nor have a life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now it is easily understandable that everything that would follow would only be self sabotage in order to meet that expectation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My relationship With god or lack thereof&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never really prayed because I couldn&amp;#39;t understand the language. That resulted in a detachment from the principal of praying itself. Mostly I was too lazy to engage in the exercise. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did pray though, as a child, whenever i would be left alone in a dark room by myself or when i wanted something that i believed would only be possible through a miracle. The word miracle for me simply means being granted whatever i truly wanted, and for some reason, i always wanted the most expensive things from my parents to afford. It wasn&amp;#39;t  really much, but the circumstances were not favorable financially speaking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would also pray because my parents were very persistent about it. The idea i believe was more significant with a common saying in french :&lt;em&gt;” l&amp;#39;appétit vient en mangeant”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am not even sure it makes sense to me in  this context but yet somehow it does… at least to their perspective. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe, am not sure, the idea of a loving god was introduced to me at the age of 14. That came as a shock because I was never presented with that image of god growing up. The message i would receive would only describe him as an omnipotent being that should be feared or else you would be doomed to hellfire for eternity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had and still have so many questions about things in religion that I find incoherent, but back then, I was too afraid to ask, or maybe didn&amp;#39;t care enough or didn&amp;#39;t know enough to care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in fact doomed to that hellfire according to what I was told about the religion and even though by some miracle I managed to access heaven, it was clear to me that I had no interest in the 70 virgin women at my disposal, in one word, pervy, and if anything, everything else in there seemed so boring to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to admit to myself that religion was not for me. I could only hope that at some point in life granted by some miracle again, I could find my way to it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miracle, I overuse the word, for me, it means happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never described myself as an atheist and neither could i say i was a religious person for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the idea of a creator would be a logical explanation for existence and life itself. I also think that humanity as i experienced it, is nothing like that god would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our inerrant selfishness, cowardice and egotistical behaviour that translates in many aspects of religion is simply something that i can&amp;#39;t make sense of when it comes to saying something as such : “we were made in god’s image” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selfish, coward, egocentric,.. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should know, I was both fluent and expert in the practice of those. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, somehow, I ended up being exactly the opposite of the above. Paradoxical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could never explain how that came to be. I could say that I finally accepted that I wasn&amp;#39;t worthy of happiness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told myself, if i can&amp;#39;t experience things in life that could make me happy, i would participate in whichever way in making some other people happy in my stead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That became my religion in some ways. If my life has no meaning and we are all doomed to this misery, we owe it to each other to make our existence more bearable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world is already full of despicable ignorants and self centred people. I would try my best to be one less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am no angel, i am no good, i am inherently bad but i can always try…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am still not happy and recently started looking into ways to end my life the most effective way and less painful, but there&amp;#39;s more to the story.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

I take a day for myself to wake up to notifications saying I’m failing . I’m almost done with school but I just can’t. I made it to 18 in April and I can’t give up but I want to so badly . I’m staying for him. For him . My brain doesn’t work to make sense I’m sorry . I can’t do this . I work and work and do everything with no payoff . I’m getting no where in life and everyone around me is thriving but I’m stuck . This is life . You bust your ass until your mental health is noexsistent to make things slightly comfortable but it’s a never ending cycle. This is forever . There’s no cure , there’s nothing. It’s just pain and these obsessive thoughts forever. Just make it go away . I want to be normal . I want to be happy and organized and I want my grain to work . Im giving up . I just lost a coworker to suicide and I understand. If I had the courage I would to . I have to wake up and go to work tomorrow and I don’t want to . I don’t want to wake up . They didn’t close the store to mourn her loss . She deserved that . A day of silence for her . Would they do it for me ? I don’t know . Am I worth that ? They didn’t even put up her picture in the lobby upon request . She deserved that . At least that&lt;/p&gt;

To Everyone I Left Behind

I’m writing this on the 23rd of October, 2020. I used to think things would get better. I’ve been hanging on and pressing forward under the assumption that one day I could find some measure of peace. There was always something I was chasing which I felt would change everything if I could just achieve it. First it was escape from abuse. Next I dreamt of friends who value me and a girl to love me. I thought a decent job and a nice place to live would help me steady myself. I’ve always been wrong. Recently I learned it doesn’t matter what I have or who I share it with; I’m miserable regardless. That's the realization that drove me to finally act. Nothing I do, nothing I achieve, and no relationship I foster will ever change the way I feel. Life will always be one brutal struggle after another.

I don’t want anything anymore. I don’t want a loving wife. I don’t want children. I couldn’t care less about travel or sightseeing. There’s nothing else I want out of life. Nothing has stopped me except fear that I’ll hurt those people closest to me. I’ve come to see that, whenever and however I die, the people closest to me will mourn; I’m no longer willing to bear the burden of living for the sake of protecting others from inevitability. 

I wrote this because I want everyone to know why I did it. It’s nobody’s fault, I just don’t want to keep doing this anymore. I’m in pain all the time and this was the only way to end it. I hope you can all come to terms with my decision someday. I love you.",t2_8llch5wg,False,,0,False,I wrote my letter.

Im hurting so so much and there's never anyone there for me. No family. Socially awkward friends who, let's face it are so happy and enthralled in their new life simply saying anything more than 'i work so much, im just tired' would be burdening them.

I'm 22 years old and have been dealing with mental health issues since school, I think the only reason I've managed to last this long is genuinely because of my mother who unfortunately died in June. I've tried working jobs with very little to no success as I keep having issues with mental health and having extreme episodes where I can't think or do anything. Ever since school I've seen doctors about it and since about 14 was put down to anxiety, within the last couple of years I was told I could have a form of autism, I've been told by others possible bipolar or possible BPD.  


To this day I've never no matter how hard I've rang and cried and pleaded on the phone got the help I need and nearly every mental health person I've seen has just basically dismissed me after I've missed a phone appointment or something, something that is because of the ongoing problems I'm having. Then because of that they say that I am better and no longer need the help and it's another waiting list just for them to tell me I can only help myself and that I need to go out and socialise. Sometimes I spend all my time out with ""friends"", sometimes all my time at home crying wanting to just die, I've attempted a couple of times in the past.  


It's impossible for me to live like this, I spend more than half the month with no money because I end up having a suicidal episode where I end up self destructive and I end up with nothing. Every month since at least June I've spent 2 weeks out of every month not eating. I live with my brother who at times has seemed like he wants to help and understands but then everything is used against me a week after and I'm guilt tripped for cutting myself, not having a job, using even the slightest thing like some bread when I've been desperate feeling ill.  


I've now got 3 weeks with no money or food to go, in a household I'm not welcome, wanting to just die constantly but feeling selfish and everything for it, not wanting someone to find my body, not wanting to leave stuff unsaid, so I sit in a panic state constantly with no friends or family to help at all.  


I know people say it's never worth it but it's the least selfish thing I could ever do, it frees the burden of me on everyone, I know I don't bring anything to the table just problems and issues and even though I want to want to live, I just don't and life feels impossible to me, I've tried to prove myself wrong too and others but I can't.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm in my 30s and alot of people my age are married with children, busy with work, already have their clique of friends, so it's very hard to make new friends at my age.

I went through a lot of verbal and emotional bullying in school and it continued in college and office jobs in adulthood. It seems like most other geeks/nerds at least had other geeks/nerds as friends when growing up. But I didn't even have them as friends. People have said in condescending ways that I don't talk, I look lonely, I just ""study all the time"", I've never had a girlfriend, I'm short, etc. I've had to deal with so much bitterness and PTSD flashbacks for pretty much my whole life since middle school. 

Not just about the past bullying but how it has affected my life right now. That is, I now have social anxiety, and people have absolutely *no* empathy for shy people and victim-blame them for being weak. I can't just ""get over it"" because even when I consistently try to make friends, be confident and outgoing by attending meetups, many of the people there are cliquish and unwelcoming towards shy, low-status males. So many times people ignore what I say, talk over me and interrupt me, treat me like a 3rd wheel, talk to others instead of me, if left alone with me then make up an excuse to leave me, etc. For the ones who are friendly and actually listen, alot of them don't show up to following meetups

What's so frustrating is that I feel I'm way more proactive than most people yet I have nothing to show for it. Not just in regards to how I always have to go to meetups and go alone whereas most people already have friends and don't need to go to meetups. But also in how I have to strike up conversations with people whereas people who already have friends and cliques can get away with making no effort in socializing with new people with lesser status than them. 

For example, one common advice is ""ask people questions"" and ""people love talking about themselves"". I've asked many people many questions about themselves and shown interest in them, only for them to either show disinterest and give blunt replies, or talk at length about themselves, while not asking me *any* questions and showing *no* interest in me

Another example of my proactiveness is that I've spent nearly a year on weightlifting and BJJ, yet I don't really feel any more confident, less shy, and or have less PTSD flashbacks than before. I also tried meditation many times and hardly noticed any improvement. I've also attended plenty of Toastmasters meetings and given numerous speeches yet noticed no improvement in my life

I have traveled to nearly 10 countries and spent a few months living in some of them. Most were friendly and some were rude towards me, possibly judging me as a ""loser back home"" who came there to escape my problems back home. 

Another common piece of advice from society for introverts is to play sports as you can have fun without talking as much. But I often am not taken seriously, get picked dead-last, many times have to deal with rude immature pricks trying to shove me and such, rude teammates being cliquish and showing obvious favoritism towards their friends or guys taller than me, etc. I'm in ok shape as I'm around 5'6 and 145 lbs

Another common piece of advice from society regarding getting dates is ""it's a numbers game"", ""you got nothing to lose by asking her out"". I've *literally* cold-approached over 2000 women at nightclubs/shopping malls/coffee shops/etc and didn't get *even one* girlfriend/lay from it. I got around 10 girls willing to go on dates with me (none of them wanted a 2nd date), and maybe one would've been interested in a hookup at a nightclub, but another guy took her from me and I didn't see her again. 

What angers me is that so many guys can easily get girlfriends despite having never cold-approached a woman as they always get introduced to them because they have status/social circle, or they use dating apps with photos demonstrating their status/social circle. I had no choice but to cold-approach because I've been a reject/outcast/loner my whole life

I've also seen numerous therapists and none of them really helped. Sure, they listened and showed some empathy but didn't really offer any solutions. 

Since I'm socially screwed, I can at least do well with my career and financially, right? Not so much. I have a high net worth and income for my age, but it's chump change compared to other software engineers my age. As angry as I am about being very underpaid, I'm finding it nearly impossible to get a new higher-paying job because of all the competition, I often feel so unmotivated and depressed that I lack the energy to study for coding interviews, etc. Some of them make 3-5x what I make as they had friends refer them for jobs, they didn't have employment gaps like I did from workplace bullying, they can concentrate when preparing for interviews as they don't have depression/PTSD like me, etc. 

Why are people so cruel/judgemental/condescending towards low-status males who can't join cliques? Is it because they have no empathy for they have to go through because they themselves never had to experience being excluded, ignored, bullied, etc? Or is because of ""hurt people hurt people""? They're hurt themselves so instead of helping social rejects, they want to project their hurt onto them?

I feel nothing at all.

For some reason I often, if not always, find myself wanting to be back in that darkness that my depression used to be. Before meds, before getting in a relationship. By all means I’m better than before but I wish I wasn’t, as awful and probably insensitive as that is to say. I feel guilty for wanting to go back to the nonstop thoughts about planning my suicide and self hateful thinking. 

If I knew getting better meant being stuck feeling nothing 24/7 I wouldn’t have bothered with therapy or medication. I preferred the misery over whatever this is. The only thing that remains from how I felt before is the fatigue. Mix that with apathy and what results is me lying in place, too tired to do anything and thinking about nothing at all.

I want my misery back. I want off this medication. I want to have the drive to kill myself again. I want to die but I never will end it myself in the state I’m in right now.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm at a point where I want to die but don't want to kill myself. The reason why I don't want to do it myself is twofold: first, it'd hurt my family. Second, I might fail and permanently injure myself. I want someone or something else to kill me.

Looking at the current events, however, I think I might get a chance to die in the near future. Though my age makes me unlikely to die from COVID, I think a second American civil war is becoming increasingly likely given the current political situation in the US.

,SuicideWatch,"Warning: (mentions of sexual abuse)I have had suicidal thoughts for as long as i remember. When i was 4 i even remember telling my cousin that i was going to kill myself. After that life didn't get much better. Well if i were to go into a long paragraph about my life story and every reason i have to want to die that will be a long story, for now im going to be talking about the reason this time (yes i tried to kill myself multiple times woops.) The thing is i have never had a good year. I have had moments but over all their is allways some problem or some random mood swing that leaves me wanting to die for atleast half of the year. I dont strive to be happy really i just strive to be ok for once. I dont want to feel pain anymore. I just feel hopeless. I have diagnosed depression so sometimes even when things are going ok i am still stuck with constant pain. When i was in 3rd grade i was molested by a girl in my school. She was the same age as me. The first time it happened she told me if i told my parents they would kill me because it is wrong to be gay. So i didn't know what she was doing and i didn't even know how sex worked at all so i was just very confused. Because of that combined with other bullying i started to pull my hair out untill i was bald due to stress which made me feel unattractive and stripped me of my self confidence completely. I really didn't like it when she assaulted me but i couldn't say no because i thought what she was doing was normal for friends. I even encouraged it sometimes because she was really mean to me but she was my only friend so when she would do those things it was the only time she would show me affection. I never told anybody untill 6th grade when i was finally able to break free from her. I was still pretty clueless about the weight of what she did to me so i told a friend of mine and her being a 6th grader took it lightly and told the whole school and they proceeded to call me a lesbian, slut, ect...  My dad found out because he overheard me talking to my friend about it. He was very supportive but i still felt guilty because i still felt like maybe i was lying about being raped and it was really my fault. I only really said no directly maybe 2 out of many times and i even encouraged it sometimes because i thought that maybe she would be nice to me for once so maybe i was just a discusting whore. When i told my mom she laughed and jokingly asked if that makes me gay now and told me that its bad because that makes me impure and not a virgin anymore. She also scolded me for not being able to push her away. Fast forward to age 15. I finally understand my trauma, i understand the weight of it and seem to have gotten over it. I know its not my fault and am more self aware and emotionally intellegant. I am not the child i used to be. Well not exactly...So i got a boyfriend that i love very much. We are sexually active and he knows about my trauma because i told him. He told me that he wants to hang out more outside rather then have sex at the house and for some reason that just triggered me. I just felt like i was the only one horny one and i was just disgusting and i randomly just felt extremely embarrassed and ashamed. Not only that but during sex he likes to call me a slut and pretend he doesn't want me sometimes (he has a power struggle kink i do it back too) and it sort of makes me feel a little uncomfortable but im into it too a little dispite that and i just tried to push those thoughts away because i want to show that i am strong enough to handle it and i still want sex to be fun for him. So i tried to find a solution. I no longer wanted to feel rejected so i was like ok im going to be flirty untill he gives in and initiates and i feel ok again. Well... He had an anxiety attack because he told me i was acting strange, and i felt horrible like i was just being petty when he is going through something worse and i should support him instead of get passive aggressive. So i told him about my issue and everything seemed ok and we talked it out untill he went to sleep. After that i just felt completely suicidal. I cant talk to him about my trauma or how much i want to die i can only bring up a small portion because i don't want to burden him. I just then started to feel hopeless like my trauma will allways pop its head in and i cant escape. Then just a ton of flashbacks happened and i felt like i didn't want him to touch me anymore i just really feel disgusted with myself. At the heat of the moment i got out a necktie and made a noose and tied it to the ceiling fan and just tried to kill myself. I ended up makeing it too long so i just stood their anxious and shaking while i was trying to push myself down. And i stoped once my face got purple and the ringing in my ears got so loud it terrified me. After that i just cleaned up and looked at the mark on my neck. I realized that i cant tell anyone about this because it will make me feel attention seeking but im scared. I think im in danger now and i have nobody i feel comfortable talking to.

,SuicideWatch,"I have been thinking lately, how I have become a significant nuisance in the lives of the people I love and care about. I just keep being a bother that gnaws on their well-being, slowly making their lives worse. Especially for my family and my mother. She didn't deserve to have more shit to deal with, being virtually bedridden is more than enough. 

And yet she has to put up with me being an useless slacker that can't even get his own shit figured out, that can barely keep up with basic things as keeping the house organized. Despite the fact that not doing that just causes her more pain and suffering. I still can get myself together to do that. It's almost like I don't care about her, like some sort of heartless monster.

Nevermind the fact that I am virtually a leech, a parasite consuming whatever my family has to sustain itself without giving them anything back. Not even am I able to fulfill my role of student, doing the major I have always dreamed of. Turns out it's just a dream, as I have proven myself to be quite unable to do fucking anything.

The worst thing is that I am occupying a slot someone else who would be much more capable of taking advantage of. Someone who actually has earned being where I am. Someone who deserves it. But that's not me. Never has been, it is clear. Because I just am not good for anything.

Too dumb, too harmful, too detrimental, good for nothing. Perhaps I am exactly that. Maybe I always have been a monster in the making, slowly wrecking havoc in the lives of anyone remotely related to me, but it just has become apparent to me now. Did I just get the self-awareness I have always needed? Who knows.

Whatever the case might be, the point is that now I am painfully aware of the consequences of my existence. It stands to reason, then, that my existence *has* to end if I will stop being such a detriment to everyone else.

As I don't have the option to OD or hang myself and slitting my wrists or any vital vein or artery is bound to fail and also be traumatizing for whoever stumbles upon such an image, I have been considering to run away with no devices on me at all, no ID, nothing.

Just leave the house with the most raggedy clothes I have and leave everything else behind. Then I can find a place I can just bury myself in, so no one ends up stumbling upon a rotting corpse. And then I'll leave nature to do the rest. It's painful, but that is exactly another reason to do it; a being like me who just creates pain and misery deserves to get it all back, no? What better way to do than by starving myself to death?

Or perhaps I could just throw myself into a river, there's plenty of large ones around. The body is bound to just sink if I get myself sufficiently far from any person who might see that. Drowning sounds like another painful way to go, so to the list it goes. 

Plus, the good thing about just disappearing is that people will not blame themselves if I kill myself, they won't be tormenting themselves with doubts and what ifs. If I disappear people might be worried for a while, but then they will move on. Life will go on and they will get to reap the fruits of a life without me; a better life.

But of course, it's all a pipe dream for now. I will have to wait until I can somehow manage to leave every behind, and properly prepare to that moment. But I already have an idea of what I'll be doing.

&lt;p&gt;Plus, the good thing about just disappearing is that people will not blame themselves if I kill myself, they won&amp;#39;t be tormenting themselves with doubts and what ifs. If I disappear people might be worried for a while, but then they will move on. Life will go on and they will get to reap the fruits of a life without me; a better life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, it&amp;#39;s all a pipe dream for now. I will have to wait until I can somehow manage to leave every behind, and properly prepare to that moment. But I already have an idea of what I&amp;#39;ll be doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a matter of time before people are free.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I am 23 years old. All my life I have been introverted (which I didn't use to mind) and unpopular (which I have always minded).

Every day I wish I could either go back to the past and fix my mistakes or wake up as somebody else.

I may be autistic to some degree, and as a child I had such a terrible time socializing that my parents moved me to a different school because I was tremendously isolated all the time. In the following school things were equally terrible, and to add to that my grades became awful as well.

Also, I never played sports nor did extra activities, which made me uninteresting and weak. I was awfully unpopular and everyone picked on me.

I was always more childish than my peers. When kids started flirting and doing ""grown-up things"" like drinking and smoking, I did none of that. When they started dating and going to parties, I wasn't part of that either.

When I entered college, I had no interest in the major I had entered and I quit after only one year. I was so ashamed of my bad reputation, my bad grades and my bad physique that I didn't socialize at all and I made no friends at all. While other people partied and dated, I did none of that.

I became self-secluded and I missed on all the developmental milestones that other people achieved. Drinking with friends, going to a disco, dating, having sex, attending parties at someone's house. I did NONE of that.

So, the question:

**Is it worth it to stay alive at this point?**

I have already attempted suicide and failed. I hate my life, I hate what I have lived. I would trade it all for a different life right now.

I tried therapy and also medication, but both of those things seriously aren't helping me at all. They do nothing.

I missed out on everything and ""catching up"" at 23 seems pointless to me. Doing NOW what I didn't do at 16-18 feels to me like a sad rendition of something I should have done when it was the time.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I wish I was kidnapped, imprisoned, and mercilessly tortured.

Wouldnt have to think about anything. Wouldnt be a failure, a social outcast, or an emotional burden.

Just raw pain as someone tortures me ever more cruelly. My entire being wrapped up in pain and just trying to survive another 30 seconds.

Until I give in to the pain. Give up and accept it as the only friend I have. Beg for more. Relish in the sweet agony of being held an inch above death without ever being able to reach it.

I would beg for more. Maybe I would be trained to hurt myself. I would devise my own punishments. Air them for the world to see. How much can a sack of meat take? What would its reaction be to certain things? Would I scream? Convulse? Rip my hair out and try to strangle myself with it? Would I bash my head against the wall until passing out and then awaken to a red hot iron burning my feet? Would I then be forced to walk on glass?

How long could I smile under such circumstances? What would it take to convince me to chop off my own hand and beg to be allowed to eat it?

Would I even be allowed to speak or would my tongue be cut out and skewered?  Maybe sleep deprivation would be the worst. Not allowed to lie down, sit, or crouch. Would you play darts with my face? Would you smash my fingers with a hammer? Would you make me sit still without moving for weeks and make me beg to flex a single muscle?

I promise I would listen and do as you say. My mind and my soul are gone. I am nothing. I am your plaything designed to exact your revenge. Think of me as your worst enemy, the worst thing that has ever lived. Why can't you tear me down, tear me apart, tear me from this world and force me to live as a wretched and miserable piece of garbage?

I want to beg for the end. But never quite get there. A month, a year, a decade. Into old age. My mind twisted, stunted, and no longer human. My nerve endings scarred from the pain and my pain aversion sense dismantled. Please one more blow. One more agonizing punishment. One more day of hell before I go. And you never let me go. I dont want to go but you never let me go. And i am so happy. So happy to finally become who i was always meant to be. And i sit in pure bliss at the dismantling of my personhood, and suddenly, without expecting it, drift off into eternal slumber.

,SuicideWatch,"A few days ago I wrote down a ""before I die"" list. Those are the things I want to do before I die. I have ""getting IKEA meatballs"" on it, so it'll be a while before that happens. There are only 2 things on that list. I couldn't think of others. 

I've been struggling with depression / anxiety for a while. Don't even remember when I started suicidal ideation, it's never really active (to the point where I would make plans) so I didn't notice when it began. Quarantine has really taken a toll on me (as a lot of other people) and I find myself incredibly lonely and exhausted and unmotivated all / most of the time. I'm a college student and I'm barely keeping up with classes, and that's only because my profs are understanding (about quarantine in general) and give a lot of extensions. At the beginning of the school year I had a few friends I tried to get dinner at least once a week with, but it has fizzled out as people get busy (and other reasons). 

Recently I'm finding myself getting triggered (panic attacks, unstoppable crying, etc.) by so many things. Most of them are related to people I've had a romantic / sexual relationship with (which all ended negatively). Some of these people I have not seen for over 3 years. And yet my friends could mention them, or I could just remember them and I would get extremely upset and be unable to do anything for a day. I usually would take the day off and just stay in bed and wait for the feeling to pass and eventually it does. But it happens again and again and I'm so tired of not being able to control my own emotions. I have such vivid memories of these people that every time this happens I replay every single action and word of our interactions. And it's like reliving the feeling of being worthless and replaceable and dumb and being abandoned and not wanted again and again. I'm scared of talking to friends because I worry they will mention something that triggers me (I have a pretty small social circle so most everyone I know knows one another); I'm scared of sleeping because of the nightmares I get. I just feel so out of control of my life. 

My coping mechanism is a yearly ritual that I do every birthday. I promised myself I would not consider suicide seriously until my birthday. On the night of my birthday I ask myself whether I want to live for another year or not. And I know where and when I would do it, should I decide not to. If I can't doing at that place and at that time, I have to wait another year. It's not the healthiest mechanism, but it's been helpful. But recently I have been thinking about different locations and times, thinking those would be fine as well. Which just adds to the lack of control I feel about my life. 

I have a psychiatrist that I go to weekly, but I still don't know how to talk to her about my suicide ideation. I don't want to be sent to the hospital. And most of the time it feels like we're talking about the most recent crisis. I never know how to start talking about this with her. 

If you read up to here, thanks for listening to my story.",t2_8lqkijfj,False,,0,False,Tired of getting triggered all the time,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_jh3vdn,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603547986.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I wrote down a &amp;quot;before I die&amp;quot; list. Those are the things I want to do before I die. I have &amp;quot;getting IKEA meatballs&amp;quot; on it, so it&amp;#39;ll be a while before that happens. There are only 2 things on that list. I couldn&amp;#39;t think of others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been struggling with depression / anxiety for a while. Don&amp;#39;t even remember when I started suicidal ideation, it&amp;#39;s never really active (to the point where I would make plans) so I didn&amp;#39;t notice when it began. Quarantine has really taken a toll on me (as a lot of other people) and I find myself incredibly lonely and exhausted and unmotivated all / most of the time. I&amp;#39;m a college student and I&amp;#39;m barely keeping up with classes, and that&amp;#39;s only because my profs are understanding (about quarantine in general) and give a lot of extensions. At the beginning of the school year I had a few friends I tried to get dinner at least once a week with, but it has fizzled out as people get busy (and other reasons). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#39;m finding myself getting triggered (panic attacks, unstoppable crying, etc.) by so many things. Most of them are related to people I&amp;#39;ve had a romantic / sexual relationship with (which all ended negatively). Some of these people I have not seen for over 3 years. And yet my friends could mention them, or I could just remember them and I would get extremely upset and be unable to do anything for a day. I usually would take the day off and just stay in bed and wait for the feeling to pass and eventually it does. But it happens again and again and I&amp;#39;m so tired of not being able to control my own emotions. I have such vivid memories of these people that every time this happens I replay every single action and word of our interactions. And it&amp;#39;s like reliving the feeling of being worthless and replaceable and dumb and being abandoned and not wanted again and again. I&amp;#39;m scared of talking to friends because I worry they will mention something that triggers me (I have a pretty small social circle so most everyone I know knows one another); I&amp;#39;m scared of sleeping because of the nightmares I get. I just feel so out of control of my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My coping mechanism is a yearly ritual that I do every birthday. I promised myself I would not consider suicide seriously until my birthday. On the night of my birthday I ask myself whether I want to live for another year or not. And I know where and when I would do it, should I decide not to. If I can&amp;#39;t doing at that place and at that time, I have to wait another year. It&amp;#39;s not the healthiest mechanism, but it&amp;#39;s been helpful. But recently I have been thinking about different locations and times, thinking those would be fine as well. Which just adds to the lack of control I feel about my life. &lt;/p&gt;

And most of the time it feels like we&amp;#39;re talking about the most recent crisis. I never know how to start talking about this with her. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Ok so a few years ago when I was a sophomore in high school I bought a noose from our local Walmart so that I could hang myself. I almost attempted suicide but I chickened out in the last minute out of fear. I then went home with my noose after failing to kill myself and hid the noose under my bed.

That noose stayed there for 2 in a half years until I recently threw it out at few months ago because I wasn’t as suicidal right now compared to how I was a few years ago. 

I’m doing better right now, but I still have thoughts of killing myself at times. I love my family and I don’t want to see them in pain because they lost their child to suicide. Should I tell my family my that I almost attempted suicide a few years ago or should I move on and keep it private?

I mean if you think about it, if I were to successfully commit suicide right now, my family would be upset right. If I were to successfully commit suicide after telling my family that I use to be suicidal in the past, they would still be upset. No matter if I told them I was suicidal or not, they would still have the same reaction if I were to kill myself.

I don't really know where to put this. I'm not familiar with forums or social media (I had to do some research to create this account). I just dont have anyone right now.  
I realize that my problems must seem stupid or meaningless. They feel like that to me too.

I think everything got worse the day I was born. My mother is mentally ill and suicidal and ever since i was a toddler i was told every day how I made her want to kill herself, how I ruined her life, how I shouldn't have been born. She's said it over and over and still says it now. I want to leave but I know she'll try to hurt me more or the rest of my family members. I'll also ruin all of our relationships. I know if i go, I can't make any contact with them ever again. I'm stuck.

My mother often gets violent when upset and mumbles to herself and throws things. Sometimes she hits me or tries to strangle me. My other family members are aware of this but never did anything because almost everyone in our family is scared of her.  They're not aware of how she molested me when i was nine years old though. I never told anyone because I knew it would ruin our family and I don't want to make everyone else suffer more than I already have. 

I'm conflicted on my mother. She often does spoil me with gifts and food, but I feel no emotional connection to her, and i feel uncomfortable acknowledging her as my mother. I don't feel like she's my mom. She's not afraid to hurt me if something doesn't go her way or threaten suicide or self harm. 

I think im unfortunately a lot like her. I have a boyfriend and friends, so I should be grateful, but all I do is cry and hurt myself and at this point, i'm sure they're all tired of me and hate me.

Today my boyfriend and I got into a disagreement or something. I don't know. I had a nightmare and began crying and shaking. He rather coldly said to calm down and i stopped to avoid angering him. He's kind and selfless but i'm selfish and i wear him out. I told him how disgusting I was and he got upset and said no. I asked him if he hated me. He said no. He asked if he should just leave, something out of the ordinary. He's never said something like this before and i began crying and said he could leave me if he wanted. He got upset again. I apologized for being the worst partner ever. He left without saying goodbye and that was it. I hate myself for making him so miserable.

I can't trust my friends to talk about this with. One would panic if I talked about suicide. I dont think i trust the others enough. 

I just want to end it all. I make everyone upset and distressed. I know i have no value by continuing to live and my life is only getting to go worse, i feel like a ticking time bomb at this point. Sooner or later I know i'll kill myself. I'm not the sort of person who has any value or worth. I feel disgusted knowing I'm alive, and I've caused so much damage.

I dont know what to do. Im not looking for some ""you can do it! you've lived this long"". I've heard it before and it isn't true. I'm just weak.

Am i worth anything at all?

,SuicideWatch,"Over a month ago a friend in my friend group committed suicide. It’s hit everyone hard. But I’m on the outside. I’m very close to people that were close to him but he and I only had a handful of interactions. Interactions that are important to me and that I’m grateful to have had but in a strange way I don’t feel valid to grieve for him. Yet his departure still hurts immensely. 

This however is not the first suicide to rock my social circle. 

It’s hit hard every times but it’s hit different every time. It has been so far removed that the empathy is there but the pain isn’t. It’s hit so close that I’ve cried for months and felt pain that I was sure I would never recover from. 

I’ve seen and experienced suicide first hand. I see how it wrecks and rips and breaks friends and families and lovers. 

So here I am. 

I can not possibly inflict the pain of suicide onto the people who know me and have befriended me on the crazy ride we call life. I love them and care for them too much to do that to them. 

But it is painful to live. It is painful to feel my heart break and to feel so fucked up and broken and worthless.

It’s hit everyone hard. But I’m on the outside. I’m very close to people that were close to him but he and I only had a handful of interactions. Interactions that are important to me and that I’m grateful to have had but in a strange way I don’t feel valid to grieve for him. Yet his departure still hurts immensely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This however is not the first suicide to rock my social circle. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hit hard every times but it’s hit different every time. It has been so far removed that the empathy is there but the pain isn’t. It’s hit so close that I’ve cried for months and felt pain that I was sure I would never recover from. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"my whole life ive been called stupid, like seriously by everyone. it started in kindergarten and continued every year until sophomore year of college, I had teachers (and peers) consistently tell me i can't do anything right, maybe if i was smarter people would like me more, asked me why i need so much help all the time and to stop asking questions. all this gave me an intelligence complex, so even though I have almost a 4.0 in college, I still get set off very easily when someone implies that I'm not smart or when a situation makes me look incompetent. I know I come across as stupid and I don't know how to fix it, I think i am masking a moderate case of autism because social situations never come naturally and as a kid I had no idea what was going on or how to communicate anything. Today, people think I'm a bimbo and tell me that i assume i don't need to know anything because i'm ""pretty"" but i hate the way i look and i have no self confidence whatsoever. i have friends but i'm just a joke to them, they only see me as entertainment and its obvious I'm barely even seen as a human being, same goes for my family. lots of guys want to hook up with me but never want anything serious because I'm a shell of a person, despite the years of character development provided by bullying. I'm anxious, twitchy, I talk like i have a marble in my mouth, have trouble making eye contact, people look away when I'm talking to them and start their own conversations. It's devastating to realize that if you died people might feel sad but no one could say they were really close with you. All I want are close relationships and the ability to make conversation with people, to be someone worthy of basic respect.

Anyway I've been depressed since childhood but something that happened yesterday made me pretty sure that I don't want to be alive. I finally built up the courage to try to get my driver's license after the trauma of my friend dying in an accident while I was taking driver's ed as a 15 y/o. My mom, who knew I was nervous, drove me there and screamed at me the entire time for not filling up the tank with gas (with what money, with license?), I asked her to stop, i'm not neurotypical and I knew i wouldn't be able to focus on the test. When we got there my hands were shaking and i was holding back tears. The instructor was aggressive with me (he got angry with me when I asked him to repeat himself once). I didn't fully understand his vague instructions and I was already upset, but I was scared to ask for clarification because all my life teachers have demeaned me for asking questions. I did my best to complete the test but when I was finished the instructor told my mom to reschedule a new test because I'm incompetent and I just do whatever I want with no concern for anyone else, and I'm so sure of myself for no reason. That hurt deeply for reasons I can't totally explain. It showed me that no matter how good my intentions are, people are just unnecessarily cruel and that there's a huge disconnect between who i really am and how people perceive me. I wish I was able to communicate better and understand/ be understood.

People's opinions shouldn't matter but how else do you construct an identity? I have no reason to have a single shred of self worth because I'm constantly demeaned and picked apart (even by strangers). maybe this is a bad example but it's just the tip of the iceberg. the rules of social interaction make no sense to me. I'm boring and I'm dull. I find myself inadvertently stealing aspects of people's personalities all the time (someone told me this might be a symptom of autism). Maybe i'm just too sensitive for this world.

After the driving test, my mom is so willing to believe the worst about me, saying I'm so smug, I never even try to listen to anyone. I cry on the way home because I realize this is all I have to look forward to for the rest of my life. I try so hard to understand things but nothing ever makes any sense the way it seems to for others. Later I finally tell my mom I don't want to live and have felt this way for a very long time. She calls my psychiatrist on her cell that night (who knows nothing of my depression &amp; just prescribes adderall for me) and tells her that I'm acting erratic, I'm threatening suicide, etc. when I was very calm and explained I have no plans to hurt myself, just a passive death wish (not entirely true). We went to the hospital and then resolved to find me a therapist soon.

It's come to the point where I'm making pros/ cons lists but all the pros are being eclipsed by these dark thoughts.

1. Finally being in a relationship. I've been in love with this man from college for three years now. I've only really been with him. we hooked up for a whole year and a half and I think he was only sleeping with me during that time. I haven't seen him since last December before he got a girlfriend. They broke up a few months ago and he's been texting me recently (he's never really done this before, I guess he's just bored) sweet messages and calling me love and beautiful, saying that he admires the way I advocate for marginalized communities. I've never had someone treat me this kindly and it feels odd. Last year when I was sick for a month, he even said he missed me when my best friends didn't even reach out to me. Part of me thinks he genuinely likes me and, as sad as it sounds, it's the main thing that's made me hesitate about killing myself, but if he knew how stupid i am and how much baggage and sadness I have, he wouldn't want me. It just feels like it's never going to happen for me and one of the major reasons I wanted to get my license was so that I could finally hang out with him. I won't rely on someone else for happiness, I know how fleeting that is, but it would help me dig myself out of this dark hole.
2. Grad school. My only dream since middle school was to get into Harvard one day to prove that I am, in fact, smart. I thought that would fix everything- myself, my soul, my life. I've worked so hard in undergrad despite my learning differences, picked a challenging double major + minor, plenty of extracurriculars. I've given up on all of it, I've barely done any homework all semester and I don't see the point if I'm going to end my life.
3. The off chance that my future will be better than my past and present. The only time in my life I've ever felt like I had something to offer the world was in 8th grade when I performed a monologue and my drama teacher pulled me aside and said ""I'm not blowing bubbles up your butt. You have real talent and could make it a profession if you wanted to."" I thought she was just being nice but she even recorded my monologue and showed it in front of the entire class saying that I had an incredible gift for acting and they could all learn from me. She continued to urge me to go into acting throughout that year and the next year saying she's not kidding and she's never seen talent like mine before in someone who was not a professional actor (perhaps a lifetime of sadness has some fringe benefits). I don't know why ever since I fell into this deep depression I have been thinking of that for the first time in years when I haven't even done any acting at all since then. Maybe it's a sign, I have no idea. I do know that if I die there's no chance of finding out if she was right.

Recently, however, I've been having some bizarre OCD superstitions wherein I feel like my dead grandpa is communicating with me through angel numbers. His lucky number was 777 and I've been seeing it a lot, as well as 666. I take this to mean that it's time to kill myself and finally find peace. I'm not schizophrenic, just raised to be superstitious plus I have OCD so it's easy to get carried away. I also feel strangely connected to two former students at my college who died by suicide at my same grade, in my same major, who grew up in the same area that I did. I feel like even if i try to choose life, it's just going to happen to me like i'm powerless to stop this fatal trajectory.

,SuicideWatch,"I wanted to try to find one reason, any reason, to continue to live. I had wanted to kill myself since around August and the date was slated at December 10th. So I went to the psych ward, thinking correctly that I had nothing to lose in trying to find a reason not to do this.

It didn't work. People there really enjoyed my presence. I got over 20 heartfelt letters when I left. So many phone numbers. Yet... it's not what I need to make life worth living. Companionship just isn't the thing that makes me want life, only makes me hate the fact I'm hurting yet more people. While there, I literally had to take sleeping medication because the depressive thoughts were so intense I couldn't sleep. There are people in there that, if they find out I passed away, will be shattered by it. I was told by one that I'm the only person she's ever met that's completely relaxed her anxiety. Told by another that I was the first person to ever truly believe in her ability and be sincere about it. And this is how I repay that kindness. This is what I do to the people who show me they care about me.

There's a quote from my favorite manga that perfectly describes how I'm feeling at this moment. It reads 

""I'm back in my room that I am all too familiar with. There is a feeling of relief that envelops me as I return to my world. It flaunts that I never truly did a thing to move forward.

,SuicideWatch,"I've been recently diagnosed with depression, while doing my thesis, during a global pandemic.
I know that maybe I'm victimizing myself, but I'm really struggling to deal with everything.
I've spoken to my thesis tutor and she was very comprehensive regarding the diagnostic and said that it was OK to move slowly now, with the work I've been developing.
Now, I'm just trying to be active. I'm taking some medication, prescribed by the doctor. But despite feeling ""Ok"" in some days and trying to hold every single piece of shit together, it sometimes crumbles down and intrusive, depressive thoughts come, once again.
2 weeks ago I was at my low I think. I though about ending it all, disappearing from the face of the world. It got me wondering if I never existed in the first place and how good that would be. The peace that it would bring. I just wanted to die.
I confessed some of this to my boyfriend and I really thought he understood me. But sometimes, I also thinks he judges everything that I do (and mainly don't do) or that I poorly execute. My self esteem is at the lowest point in my life so far (I'm 22 years old) and I'm just tired of feeling better, believing that it gonna be OK from now on, just to understand that, in the next day I had another breakdown that does not let me get out of bed. I also think that he looks at me like I'm a burden and I really do not want to be that. Besides, I think he finally understood that I'm a failure, unable to finish my master degree.

I feel my life is just nothing
Student life: It has been 2 years since I dropped out of university and settled for an office job.
I feel I'll never amout to something.
I've lost sight of my goals, don't feel I have a path anymore, and I'm settling for whatever comes my way, and honestly I loathe myself for just dropping half way through my chemistry BA. 

The reason I stopped going to university is because I hot a slump on calculus 2 and organic chemistry 2, I tried over and over but just couldn't understand them in theory. Repeated both courses 3 times without success. I feel I'm dumb and incompetent. I've never been good at asking for help so I just drowned in my frustrations. Then I hear ""why not go back and finish?"" First of all I barely can remember the basics of chemistry, secondly, I was dumb enough to verify the market for what I wanted to do (pharmaceutical) and saw it was bottlenecked which further threw me off. Sadly I've got no other interest or potential for other fields. Suck at art, music (creative stuff in general) can't handle blood or needles so medicine field is off the map, I'm horrible at math so I doubt accounting. Don't care about politics, and is just a horrible field, can't say I'm humanistic enough to try social sciences. There's no way I'll ever be a teacher, can't stand being around raging teens/kids. 

Current career: work at an insurance company, I'm somewhat good at it, at least I don't mess up and from time to time fix someone else's screw ups. My workmates seem to appreciate me, but that only extends up to work environment, while others drink together and even play games on consoles together I'm left out, even after they asked for gamertag and console, I hear them talk about how they play x games and bla, bla bla. You may have think it was an error /accident they forgot, I did mentioned it and gave my info again, and wrote it on a paper for them, and never got even a message; I get it we're adults and we should be mature about it, but it hurts just knowing that the only reason they are nice is because you're somewhat good at the job and can help them fast on work
Which has made been made obvious by them approaching me at work to verify they did their stuff right. Don't get my hopes up, just tell me you ain't interested on knowing me beyond work. Got derailed from topic, sorry. Back to the point; realistically the skills I've got can barely be transferred to another working area, I see myself yet again on another slump in my life, even though it has been 2 years since I began working; I can't say there's much room for growth in this career line. 

Love life: the record isn't that good been left twice, one in amicable terms, one by a cheater. Yes they have been long relationships but it's apparent I'm a boring person because they leave once they get tired of the monotony. Sorry I ain't so sporadic nor got the money I wish I had to go on trips/vacations. Yes I have been contacted and told they miss me and all, but you know it's as far as it goes. Plus going back is seen as a sin/weakness by my family and friends. 

So I end up asking... What's my purpose, what am I good for, why am I even allowed to breath, I should just fuck off and die, not like the world would care. I'm already a disappointment to myself and others, so why drag the charade? It becomes more pointless the longer I live.

Anyways I'm too much of a failure. I've tried ending myself 3 times before but I've failed, just like in everything else in life.

I really feel suicidal nearly everyday, i've had countless thoughts to doing it i've attempted to do it once but couldn't, everytime I woke up I felt no reason to why I have to live it seemed that I had no motivation, I always wanted to cry, the belt to the neck was my method due to having many belts in my room.

Everytime I calmly ask my older stepsister for a problem I have with her like invading my privacy or doing whatever she wanted to me she goes beserk on me. I feel really manipulated or controlled, I realized I probably can't do anything about this even if I tried to talk it out so I left this problem running.

My little sister is just the better version of who I am, she does so much things better and isn't like who I am, has people who make her feel better or great at all times, everytime I see her, it immediately reminds me:

""Why am I lonely? Why does she always have it all better? Do I really live on her shadow? I want to be an equal""
I've tried to follow my own path but it was pretty hopeless and that I felt really demotivated, couldn't do it.

My other older stepsister minds whatever I just do and make a complaint out of it or find any reason no matter what over and over, won't mind her own business and again, had to just keep this running because talking it out seems to never work

Im lonely, haven't got friends and ""once again"", seeing my classmates, cousins or family members have the opposite of ""loneliness"" does remind me and tell me ""Why?""
They've got people who care.
I feel no freedom to anything, anything.


Whenever I wanted to tell my parents about a problem, they don't care, they tell me people had it worse and just lay it off think its ok.
Yes, I fully and definitely understand there are definitely many who have had it worse.

Right now, my only thoughts seem to be suicidal ideation and feeling sadness everyday feeling no motivation and being lonely. Don't know when the lights will be off for me.

I feel really manipulated or controlled, I realized I probably can&amp;#39;t do anything about this even if I tried to talk it out so I left this problem running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My little sister is just the better version of who I am, she does so much things better and isn&amp;#39;t like who I am, has people who make her feel better or great at all times, everytime I see her, it immediately reminds me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why am I lonely? Why does she always have it all better? Do I really live on her shadow? I want to be an equal&amp;quot;
I&amp;#39;ve tried to follow my own path but it was pretty hopeless and that I felt really demotivated, couldn&amp;#39;t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other older stepsister minds whatever I just do and make a complaint out of it or find any reason no matter what over and over, won&amp;#39;t mind her own business and again, had to just keep this running because talking it out seems to never work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im lonely, haven&amp;#39;t got friends and &amp;quot;once again&amp;quot;, seeing my classmates, cousins or family members have the opposite of &amp;quot;loneliness&amp;quot; does remind me and tell me &amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot;
They&amp;#39;ve got people who care.
I feel no freedom to anything, anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I wanted to tell my parents about a problem, they don&amp;#39;t care, they tell me people had it worse and just lay it off think its ok.
Yes, I fully and definitely understand there are definitely many who have had it worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, my only thoughts seem to be suicidal ideation and feeling sadness everyday feeling no motivation and being lonely. Don&amp;#39;t know when the lights will be off for me. Haven&amp;#39;t exactly gave up on life just yet and seeking for a little motivation and change-of-life before more problems kick in and make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;

I miss him, I miss not caring what I looked like, I miss not caring what I wear, I miss just waking up and only having to worry about school each day. I am just so done every time I try to by myself nothing good ever happens I always fuck it up and ruin everything I don’t know when I stop being me I don’t think I have been myself for a long time now I try to be happy, I try to get to see the positives in my life but i can never seem to be satisfied when them. I didn’t ask to born this way, do you think I want to look like it his, no I wish I was confident but no it’s hard when you have the shittest fucking genetics humanly possible, like how can I work with this cunt. Imagine being the ugliest in the friend group all your life, it hurts, it hurts so much when I like a girl and my friend fucking swoops in this has happened so many fucking times because my self esteem is that fucking low, I can barely look at Myself without criticising myself every morning day and night like how was I ever going succeeded in life when I’m so fucking ugly. I know the worlds not fair, every has their own problems but fuck me, sick of seeing good looking people say life’s hard like fuck I’m sure it is mate I’m sure life must be so miserable waking up looking perfect. That’s my dream. But I know dreams are stupid to hold onto, why try when I can just end it all and finally not have to look in another mirror and cry myself to sleep again and again. I don’t think anyone knows how I feel I have never told anyone any of this because it’s so fucking pathetic I’m legit crying while I type this out, I just wish I was confident enough to just be myself, be yourself they say yeah it’s not that easy I wish it was but I have tried so many times and I can’t handle everyone being happy while I’m faking a smile just to fit in. I just wish I could keep going in and building my confidence but I just can’t everyone is so fucking good at life I am so bad at it everyone seems so carefree and confident and I can barely stare at a mirror for more than 5 seconds before getting depressed. I think I have given up on girls, this is pathetic but I have always longed for a relationship someone to tell all this about, I have always wanted that, it’s the thing I will probably regret the most. I honestly have tried so many times, I don’t blame my friends how can they know how I feel when I barely can fucking talk to a girl I don’t even stare at their face because I don’t want them to look at me because I’m so ugly cunt, imagine that trying to find someone and I can’t even hold eye contact. I don’t know what to do anymore I have been with this friend group since highschool without them I legitimately have almost nothing, I’m already lonely, I already feel left out 90% of the time they do shit i just can’t start over I couldn’t I don’t have the confidence or the drive to care anymore. I lost my best friend years ago we stopped talking he was probably my only real friend I ever had, like a proper proper friend you know and I fucked it up like always. My family don’t know any of this they probably think I’m just a quiet kid but I don’t even know if I am. I feel like I’m not a quiet kid but my Confidence is that low that I have became one. I don’t think I will ever be the person I want to be, I just don’t think I can hold onto that hope, I have always known I’m ugly but when it got brought up with all the boys when we were going out one night and everyone fucking laughs what the fuck am I suppose to do, none of them realise this is probably the worst thing they could do to me, the number one thing I hate about myself and they all laugh and I sit their awkwardly laughing wanted to disappear into thin air, like why do I exist to get tortured on the fucking daily like this I don’t know what else I am suppose to do. I keep thinking I will meet a girl and my life will change but the more I think of it the stupider it fucking  sounds life’s not a movie shits not going magically click into place I’m still going look like a train wreck and want to kill my self every day. This is my lowest point I think I have ever been in my life, I don’t want Attention, fuck I want attention but is that to much to ask probably it’s just so fucked how I can be so insecure about how I look, how, how can this be in the slightest fair I know why no girl ever wants me I don’t even want myself, how will a girl want me if I hate myself it makes no sense, I am so over trying and trying just to fail again and again i wish I had someone I could talk to but my friends are that type of friend if you know what I mean fuck me just why do I bother hanging out with them, why because I have no one else I have nothing I just want to look different I know you will think life won’t suddenly get easy but I fucking think it would, having the confidence to go job interviews having the confidence to make new friends having the confidence to talk to girls having the confidence to just be myself who I was meant to be. I always wanted to just be me, but it’s hard to do when I don’t even know who me is. I don’t think I will ever get to experience that person, I don’t think I will ever be good enough for myself to accept, yes not other people, myself I want to accept me but I can’t, I can’t look in a mirror and smile to myself because what I see looking back at me is so ugly, I hate the word ugly, I hate it it’s such a fucking disgusting word the word is made for me, I’m not ugly like fat or facial features it’s just these fucking moles and freckles I hate the fucking sun I have tried these laser surgery’s they suck the expensive as fuck and I look the same why does this shit exist. Why must I deal with every day while my friends have flawless skin and are so happy it hurts, it hurts to see them have fun without me I don’t even want to know the amount of shit the have probably talked about me I would probably break down and cry till I had no tears left. I can’t see myself getting old having kids I just can’t I can barely see myself getting through this year. My anxiety always gets the best of me and I procrastinate about everything no one ever messages me if I’m okay, I’m not fucking okay, I don’t remember when I was last okay, I wish I was okay but no I’m a pathetic piece of shit that has nothing to show for in life, life is a cruel joke I don’t think I was made to succeed in life I ain’t the main character I’m the shitty side character you walk by and never see again my whole existence is so fucking irrelevant what am suppose to do with myself I just want to be me is that so much to ask, it must be, I don’t think anyone has ever truly known me and they probably never will because I am so fucking lonely and it hurts to even type this out it feels wrong to even talk about how I feel, it doesn’t feel like I deserve to express my emotions I’m just not worth it, in the end we all die I guess, I’m just going have a head start on everyone else. I could keep typing for hours all my emotions have been bottled up for so long I have never spoken to anyone about how I feel, I have been faking smiles left and right for so long now, I wonder what it’s like to be happy to look in the mirror and go fuck me I look good today, I once thought I would get to that point in my life but I seriously cannot be bothered anymore it’s so hard to try when your friends constantly do things that put you down. They don’t do it on purpose though because they don’t know, they don’t know them just being their happy self hurts me so much, I long to be with them laughing, joking with them I know everyone has problems I’m not special I just can’t handle them as-well as others I guess. I have tried, I really think I did my best, well maybe not my best but I definitely did try, getting knocked down again and again, getting back up becomes too much, easier for me to stay down and out. My friend group would be fine without me I don’t except them to come to my funeral, I honestly don’t think I would want them there. I would tell my parents not to worry, they did nothing wrong, I am the problem, not them. I wished I had the courage to show someone this wall of fucking text but I would feel to bad, waiting to see their reaction, them thinking I just want their attention and I’m just making all this shit up, I wish I was but honestly it would be harder to make this shit up. I don’t know where I went wrong, I always was happy when I was younger but as I became more aware things just escalated. Highschool probably was the worst thing someone like me could go through. A situation where popularity is scaled on how u look in vast majority of cases, I wish looks didn’t matter I really wish they didn’t because it’s my greatest fucking flaw the biggest flaw the most important thing in life and oh whoops let’s not give his kid fucking any, he will be fine, it will be a fun experiment to watch him suffer and hate himself for his short life, yes maybe they have placed bets when I would kick the bucket who the hell knows. We are watching the AFL grand final tonight and then going out after going it’s going hurt so much when my friend is with the girl I wanted so fucking bad but my self esteem hit me like freight truck and I barely could speak to her so he slides right on in like I don’t exist and she doesn’t seem to give 2 fucks about me, why would she, why should she care about me when I don’t care about me, it makes no sense, I make no sense I have the stupid concept that a girl will make me happy probably from all those stupid fucking movies where they fall in love and live happily ever after. I know it’s so fucking unrealistic but I still want it so fucking bad, and I can’t, I can’t not want it, I think it’s the one fucking thing I want, nothing else would matter, it probably sounds so stupid but I really thing it would make me happy.

He decided to end things on that he wanted to focus on his studies. I understood that and we went our separate ways. I’ve been isolated for a couple of days and I just sat here for the past 45 minutes contemplating taking my life. I made a video and everything. I understand I need help now.

&lt;p&gt;I’m just gonna TLDR this whole thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been feeling helpless, depression has really taken over me. I’ve always had issues with my depression but I had a very strong support partner the past 2 years. Recently my Grandma died and I saw the body today. It sent me in a downward spiral. My boyfriend and I also broke up because he was spending less time with me and more time with other females. He decided to end things on that he wanted to focus on his studies. I understood that and we went our separate ways. I’ve been isolated for a couple of days and I just sat here for the past 45 minutes contemplating taking my life. I made a video and everything. I understand I need help now. I don’t wanna give up on myself. I hope I can find some insight here and maybe a friend. Thank you all.&lt;/p&gt;

What happens when you genuinely have calm thoughts of death? What happens when you just need an immediate way out and you can't find one? I don't want to die in pain or fail at dying, but I don't want to be a part of this world anymore. I've tried therapy and suicide hotlines. I've tried talking, I've asked so many people how they cope- the common theme? nobody copes, they just keep going for no reason. 

I have purpose, a hobby I love. Amazing friends, amazing boyfriend and supportive family. I have a degree and potential for a promising future. I have 2 beautiful cats. It's all so fleeting, we all die anyway, I don't know why I have to stay.

I hate this planet so much I don't want to be here anymore and I can't get out, I don't know why I'm alive. I feel like I've gone past my expiration date. I'm not like everyone else. I struggle and panic with the most basic of things, I get all muddled and confused. I'm constantly embarrassed and depressed. I hate having a human form, I don't feel connected to what I see in the mirror. I don't want all the things a future might contain. 

I don't want to be an adult. I don't want the responsibility of living a life and paying bills. It's too much to bare. I want to lay down and go somewhere else. I want death to take me somewhere else. I don't know if i want to be a person or a soul at all.

Nothing feels good anymore. Nothing makes me truly happy, now that summers gone every day is just rain and darkness and more misery- the pandemic is msking everything more and more bleak. I don't want to watch all my friends descend into parenthood, I don't want to keep going, why is a life so important when there are millions of lives better than mine. Why do I have to care. I don't want to contribute to society, I fucking hate society I want to get out of it all now. 

All I have ever wanted, is to be creative and just enjoy nature. I only feel happy when I'm enjoying small things like the sky or the sea, or sitting by a fire or listening to a thunder storm. I don't get to do any of these things enough because life takes its toll and society steals all your time and money away from you. I don't want this anymore. I just want to fall asleep. I just want to stay asleep. I'm in so much pain all the time.

,SuicideWatch,"I can’t deal with no sleep anymore. Like I sleep for 2-3 hours max then wake up after some stupid nightmare and can’t get back to sleep. And lack of sleep is *really* taking its toll now.

Some of these nightmares don’t even make sense. A new reoccurring one I’ve started having is the nightmare that I’m trying to fall asleep, so when I wake up it feels like I haven’t slept at all.

I tried stopping meds as I thought that was causing nightmares, it’s been two weeks and that obviously wasn’t it. I do all the stupid sleep hygiene stuff I’m told to do (no phones or cigarettes before bed, baths, hot drinks, sleeping pills, aromatherapy, reading, meditation music) - nothing works.

I’ve tried talking about the nightmares, not going straight back to sleep, going straight back to sleep, writing them down. Nothing works.

I tried increasing my work hours, because I knew that was stressing me out and adding to the guilt, so I tried to eliminate that stress. Also I was hoping that work would tire me out, which it does, but for whatever reason I still don’t sleep, so now I’m just mentally *and* physically exhausted. 

I’ve spoken to professionals about it, they recommend the sleep hygiene stuff. I tell them I’ve tried it, they say “you’re probably under a lot of stress” - no shit. I’m literally having 24 hour battles with myself trying to convince my brain that we shouldn’t go hang ourselves.

But now shit is getting scary, because the nightmares are happening as soon as I go to sleep, not a few hours in. So now we’re down to 1-3 hours before I wake up, and it’s taking its toll. 

I struggle to speak aloud during the day, I’m forgetting words for everyday items, I’m struggling to concentrate. At work I’m usually able to bounce around and put on this front for a few hours, even when things were at their peak. But now I can’t even keep that up. I’m getting snappy, I’m getting so fucking weak. I keep seeing shit when I’m trying to sleep which I know is just exhaustion, but it’s really scary.

And the thoughts are 10x worse now, which I know isn’t helped by the fact I can’t sleep. It’s not that I don’t want to sleep, I’m absolutely *desperate* for sleep. Pills don’t work. Nothing works. I’m at the point where I know what’s going to happen - and I’m pretty sure I don’t even want it to now. I’m not calm at the thought of dying now, I’m *terrified* by it. Because I remember what this is like, getting to the point where I’m calm/numb and just go welp, time to go.

Because it’s getting to that again. And I know it’s not helped by the fact I can’t sleep. I’ve tried going back on meds, but I’m not hopeful. I can’t remember the last time I was this exhausted. 

Yesterday I spent the entire day zoned out sat on my bed. I didn’t even do anything, because I didn’t have the energy, but I couldn’t sleep. So I just sat dazed for the entire day, other than a few breaks to have a cry at how tired I was, and to go for a walk with my other half so I didn’t try kill myself.

I know this is getting to a peak again soon, and this time I actually don’t have the energy to do anything about it, nor do I want to. I don’t want to die anymore, but I also *can’t* live like this. 

Exhaustion is a fucking killer in itself, man. My brain does and says stuff I didn’t even think it could, and I don’t have the energy to argue with it anymore, because I’m physically and mentally exhausted.

Then I come home to my basement apartment and spend the night alone. I do this 5 days a week. On the weekends I would go to my parents down the street, but now they are down south for most of the winter so I only have my little brother who works all the time. I think about all the things that have made me depressed 24/7 because I never talk to anyone else. Why should I? They all think I&amp;#39;m a joke and want nothing to do with me. It&amp;#39;s been a year since I moved and I have no girlfriend or any friend at all. My career has jped way higher in the last year, but it&amp;#39;s not enough to offset the pain I go through every single day. My knives here in my apartment aren&amp;#39;t sharp enough, as I&amp;#39;ve already tried that. Is it time?&lt;/p&gt;

I have Schizophrenia, Depression, ADHD, Anxiety and Autism. I’m basically fucked up. 

I get called names like crazy, insane, psycho, slut, whore, retard, emo (referencing to self harming).

Today at school i got told 3 things by “friends”: 

“You don’t have depression because you’re not depressed now” also, “kill yourself” and one of my friends made a joke about self harming, not knowing i do it until one of my friends said i did. 

I’m an idiot. I stopped taking my meds, I’m not eating properly, and i keep getting told off at school for not doing much work at all but they don’t understand ADHD and how it makes it hard and stuff. I’m alot slower than most and i have too much energy for most. Idk what to do.

I hate going to school because i don’t like people anymore. My teachers are noticing i’m seeming depressed and sad all of the time and stuff and ask me if i’m ok but i’m really not. 

I have tried therapy and they just tried to give me more meds. I couldn’t even talk well because i just kept crying and stuff. 

I had an anxiety attack and stuff when my Schizophrenia started to mess around with my head and i basically fainted in the medical room.

I said to please not to but She was really nice and took care of me and stuff and helped me when i got sad and things. She also liked to colour and coloured with me which was cool. 

I am out now but i haven’t been to school and i’m scared to go back. I don’t like myself at all now and i keep on being sad and getting dragged down and crying all of the time. I just want to take alot of my meds all at once and just hope for the worst.

,SuicideWatch,"Hey Reddit,

I met this beautiful girl over a dating app. We've been talking every day for almost three months now, and we started dating. Everything is going great, I'm really into this girl. She makes me laugh a lot, she's smart, she's super cute, and she's kind. We have a lot of similarities, and we're the same ethnicity, which only made us connect more because of our similar culture. Basically, the ideal girl for me. We go on a few dates, everything is awesome. We joke about our future together. I'm not in love yet, but I could be. I'm invested in this girl. I couldn't be happier, and she feels just as happy as I am.

Or so I thought

I knew she had problems at home; her disconnection with her parents was evident. To sum it up, her father is manipulative, abusive, (not physically), etc. And I guess her mother favors her sisters over her and disregards her feelings entirely. So she doesn't feel loved by her parents or simply isn't. But she has everything; she's a teeny bit spoiled and she knows it. But as she's said, she just wants love from her parents and their validation. I guess that's a horrible way to feel for your entire life. I would probably feel the same.

&amp;#x200B;

So, fast forward to last Friday. We go on a date, everything is awesome, and I feel in love. The following day, she told me she had an appointment with her therapist. I didn't judge, that's fine. It's extra support if you need it. But for the next few days, she barely spoke to me. She just told me we needed to talk, but continued to delay it. She wasn't texting a lot and was really brief and lacking emotion. This wasn't like her at all. She was such an energetic and happy person. So I'm over here thinking, ""what the fuck, she wants to break up?? why?? and why is she delaying it?"". It was on Wednesday that we finally spoke.

She told me her therapist had diagnosed her with dysthymia, or persistent depressive disorder, and I believe she was also deemed suicidal. Her therapist also recommended her self-admit, stating that her case isn't severe enough for him to admit her. This came as a shock to me. She had told me before that she had attempted suicide, etc, and I did think it was a yellow flag, but I didn't think it was this bad. But then again, everyone always thinks that.

We've been talking since, but everything is different. I feel like I'm talking to a completely different person, not the person I once knew. Regardless, I'm offering my support, I want to be at her side. I know she doesn't have anyone else to help. She tells me how she feels, how she thinks about suicide often, how she's numb, how she doesn't want to live. I mean, fuck. That's pretty disheartening to hear, especially from someone you thought felt the complete opposite. I offer my support, and I'm really trying to help; I'll text her often, treating her normally, but I get unenergetic responses. I can almost feel what she's going through. 

Now, she's asking me to leave her. She doesn't want me to ""see her unravel"", nor does she want to bring me down with her or impact me negatively. Imagine how you would feel if someone said this shit to you. It's horrible. But I don't want to leave her; I am here for her. 

I'm afraid to leave her. I feel that if I do leave, she'll have no one else, and she just might do it. She keeps telling me she doesn't want to die yet, and that I shouldn't worry about her. But that in it of itself is pretty fucking worrisome, no? 

So what are my options? Stay with her, possibly bring me down with her (slightly inevitable, my thoughts have already revolved around her since she told me her feelings). Or, I leave her. But I don't want to leave her. I mean, what's the point of a relationship if I can't stay and help even in the hard times? I thought about contacting her sister via social media, and just establishing a connection with the sister so that if anything starts heading in the wrong direction, I have a family member I can contact, but I don't know if I would be in the wrong to do that. 

I really like this girl. I know I'd be devastated if she killed herself. 

She keeps telling me that I need to forget about her and move on.

What I'm thinking, is that I still have enough leeway to try and convince her to hang out with me one last time. I could talk to her then, try and see how she's doing. But ultimately, I think the goal will be to get her to self-admit, no? I might be able to do that if I can convince her that I'll leave her if she can self-admit. 

If I leave her, she'll have nobody else, and she probably won't have a reason to live.

&amp;#x200B;

Please give me your thoughts. I don't know what to do.",t2_7sb9uib7,False,,0,False,Need advice for a friend and I,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0,,0,,False,t3_jgr9ry,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603501795.0,text,0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met this beautiful girl over a dating app. We&amp;#39;ve been talking every day for almost three months now, and we started dating. Everything is going great, I&amp;#39;m really into this girl. She makes me laugh a lot, she&amp;#39;s smart, she&amp;#39;s super cute, and she&amp;#39;s kind. We have a lot of similarities, and we&amp;#39;re the same ethnicity, which only made us connect more because of our similar culture. Basically, the ideal girl for me. We go on a few dates, everything is awesome. We joke about our future together. I&amp;#39;m not in love yet, but I could be. I&amp;#39;m invested in this girl. I couldn&amp;#39;t be happier, and she feels just as happy as I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or so I thought&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew she had problems at home; her disconnection with her parents was evident. To sum it up, her father is manipulative, abusive, (not physically), etc. And I guess her mother favors her sisters over her and disregards her feelings entirely. So she doesn&amp;#39;t feel loved by her parents or simply isn&amp;#39;t. But she has everything; she&amp;#39;s a teeny bit spoiled and she knows it. But as she&amp;#39;s said, she just wants love from her parents and their validation. I guess that&amp;#39;s a horrible way to feel for your entire life. I would probably feel the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, fast forward to last Friday. We go on a date, everything is awesome, and I feel in love. The following day, she told me she had an appointment with her therapist. I didn&amp;#39;t judge, that&amp;#39;s fine. It&amp;#39;s extra support if you need it. But for the next few days, she barely spoke to me. She just told me we needed to talk, but continued to delay it. She wasn&amp;#39;t texting a lot and was really brief and lacking emotion. This wasn&amp;#39;t like her at all. She was such an energetic and happy person. So I&amp;#39;m over here thinking, &amp;quot;what the fuck, she wants to break up?? why?? and why is she delaying it?&amp;quot;. It was on Wednesday that we finally spoke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She told me her therapist had diagnosed her with dysthymia, or persistent depressive disorder, and I believe she was also deemed suicidal. Her therapist also recommended her self-admit, stating that her case isn&amp;#39;t severe enough for him to admit her. This came as a shock to me. She had told me before that she had attempted suicide, etc, and I did think it was a yellow flag, but I didn&amp;#39;t think it was this bad. But then again, everyone always thinks that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been talking since, but everything is different. I feel like I&amp;#39;m talking to a completely different person, not the person I once knew. Regardless, I&amp;#39;m offering my support, I want to be at her side. I know she doesn&amp;#39;t have anyone else to help. She tells me how she feels, how she thinks about suicide often, how she&amp;#39;s numb, how she doesn&amp;#39;t want to live. I mean, fuck. That&amp;#39;s pretty disheartening to hear, especially from someone you thought felt the complete opposite. I offer my support, and I&amp;#39;m really trying to help; I&amp;#39;ll text her often, treating her normally, but I get unenergetic responses. I can almost feel what she&amp;#39;s going through. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, she&amp;#39;s asking me to leave her. She doesn&amp;#39;t want me to &amp;quot;see her unravel&amp;quot;, nor does she want to bring me down with her or impact me negatively. Imagine how you would feel if someone said this shit to you. It&amp;#39;s horrible. But I don&amp;#39;t want to leave her; I am here for her. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"So I was in the living room, blankets all over me so I guess that's why she didn't see me. But I didn't realize that at first as I was on my phone. My father called my mother and they were talking about some unnecessary things as always. Then they switched the topic to me and that's when it started.

My mother told my father that she absolutely can't stand me anymore. I behave like a 10 year old, asking her for hugs and not wanting to be alone in my room because I'm so lonely. 
I quickly realized that she didn't know I was in the room but I didn't say anything as I wanted to know what more she woul say. Big mistake.

She then went on to tell him that I always threaten her by saying that I don't want to live anymore. (I do this because I have noone else to tell this to and it kills me, ABSOLUTELY kills me when I can't talk to someone about this)
She tells him that she just wished I would kill myself so she wouldn't have to listen to my stupid ugly voice anymore.

(I have an unusually deep voice for being female and my ex-bestfriends always were shaming me for it)

She then started to cry and was really aggressively telling my father all the ways she wanted to see me dead. 

I should be hanging in my room from the ceiling.

I should be a mess of blood splattered on the ground after being driven over by a car or train.

I should be lying in my bed dead after having taken thousands of pills.

I'm going to spare you more details but she was very, very aggressively detailed about telling my father the ways in which I should die. 

My father, I guess, agreed to her or didn't try to stop her atleast. He hates me a lot. (He abused me for over 10 years)

At that point I felt the panic attack coming and didn't hear what else she was saying. She hung up soon after that.

I sat there for a couple of minutes, afraid what she would do to me when she found out, I heard her. I then quickly ran out of the room, up the stairs and smashed my door shut and put my chair infront of the door because I could already hear her screaming.

I'm absolutely terrified. I'm broken. I thought she was the only one I could trust and talk to (even though I knew she hated me from the way she always talked to me before) but now it's real. This is reality. This really just happened. Help me please. I want to kill myself so bad. I am suicidal again since 3 weeks and this week has been going ok, I thought I could finally go back to school again and forget about suicide but this just shattered me.

I had friends who abandoned me for being suicidal. And now my mother, the only person I could trust said this about me behind my back. I have noone. I want to die. Please help me. Please.

But I didn&amp;#39;t realize that at first as I was on my phone. My father called my mother and they were talking about some unnecessary things as always. Then they switched the topic to me and that&amp;#39;s when it started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother told my father that she absolutely can&amp;#39;t stand me anymore. I behave like a 10 year old, asking her for hugs and not wanting to be alone in my room because I&amp;#39;m so lonely. 
I quickly realized that she didn&amp;#39;t know I was in the room but I didn&amp;#39;t say anything as I wanted to know what more she woul say. Big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then went on to tell him that I always threaten her by saying that I don&amp;#39;t want to live anymore. (I do this because I have noone else to tell this to and it kills me, ABSOLUTELY kills me when I can&amp;#39;t talk to someone about this)
She tells him that she just wished I would kill myself so she wouldn&amp;#39;t have to listen to my stupid ugly voice anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I have an unusually deep voice for being female and my ex-bestfriends always were shaming me for it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She then started to cry and was really aggressively telling my father all the ways she wanted to see me dead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should be hanging in my room from the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should be a mess of blood splattered on the ground after being driven over by a car or train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should be lying in my bed dead after having taken thousands of pills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to spare you more details but she was very, very aggressively detailed about telling my father the ways in which I should die. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"My story i guess or a vent or something idk idc

Im not sure when it all began but for many years i have wanted to kill myself just end it all. I feel so lonely all the time. I have planned and attempted to kill myself before but either pussied out or something went wrong. When i sleep i feel at peace and in those rare occasions i have dreams i am happy, but then i wake up and realize i can never be that happy and every single day i wake up i wish i hadn't i wish i would have just died in my sleep.   
A few years ago or just 1 im not sure a thing happened which like made me feel even more suicidal and then a few months after that another thing happened and that day i went to a mountain planning to jump off but people were walking with there dogs there and i don't want those dogs to see that.  
Simular events happened over and over and then for like the past 2 months the only person i really talked to stopped talking to me. I get her tho i wouldn't talk to a fucking monster like me.  
The past 2 months or so i have just been getting worse and worse as the days go by. I moved to the city thinking my life would be different i could idk meet new people or something go out and live a little.  
But that didn't happen, i relapsed into hurting myself after the person stopped talking to me. I don't cut my arms tho since that is too noticeable, i don't eat for couple days or a week then i burn my hands and scratch and cut my back.  
For a long time i tried pouring myself into work and art to try to think of something else then what is in my head all the time and it worked, for some time. While i was drawing i didn't think of anything else but then after the drawings everything came back, until eventually i came to hate it and destroyed my left hand (i am a lefty) lived near some cliffs and smashed it with rocks and well now i don't feel anything in 2 of my fingers and it shakes a lot.

I am not afraid of dying i came to peace with death a long time ago in fact i would embrace it but then there is always someone there and i know that if i would let myself just drop in the ocean then they would just pull me out.   
It's easy to pretend to be happy so as far as people know im doing fine but in reality not a second passes with out me thinking about ending it all.

For some time i thought that if i couldn't make myself happy then perhaps someone else could, so i had some hopes of that i could be in a relationship or something but then i realized that that is nothing but USELESS HOPE. If i can't make myself happy then why the FUCK should someone else be able to do so, I DON'T DESERVE IT. Someone like me shouldn't be happy and its obvious that no one gives a shit since if they did i wouldn't be alone all the time. 

I just want to know why, why does everyone hate me so much. WHY DO I HATE MYSELF THIS MUCH.  
I just wanted to be happy in life.

,SuicideWatch,"I still want to die, nothing has changed with that in over 25 years from my first thoughts of suicide and self harm.

But I guess my mental condition has gotten especially weird now as I’m crying because someone was kind to me.

A guy I have only spoken with a couple times online purchased an amazon gift card for me for my birthday even though my birthday happened weeks before we talked. He doesn’t know anything about my personal life really. I’ve intentionally tried to be on my most normal behavior in the hope maybe I’ll have someone to talk to. The loneliness is deafening.

But he sent a $20 card to my e-mail with a kind message.

I haven’t received so much as a gift or a card from someone in many many years. I don’t even remember how long it’s been... 5 years? Longer? Maybe 7? They all run together after a while. I stopped counting or ever expecting that again.

I found myself so moved I started sobbing.

Not wanting to frighten him I said thank you over text.

I hate hiding my emotions but I’ve found it’s usually for the best.

The crying was bittersweet.

It was nice that someone would think of me, that’s moving. But it also made me sad that for so many years no one has.

As I know it was just a small token from essentially a stranger, I was privately embarrassed, surprised, and ashamed by my reaction to it.

It also made me feel odd because I do have so much trauma, and this person doesn’t know me really.

So then it’s like my brain starts going “ Does this gift mean anything at all? Why are you so emotional? It probably means nothing to them and they’d probably think you were weird for it affecting you.”

I both appreciate it but sort of wish they hadn’t sent it because it made me feel emotionally noticed and it scared me because I always have to brace for the ensuing rejection if they start asking about my trauma, hospitalizations, suicide attempts, family etc.

I’ve tried so hard to appear “normal” it’s like anything unexpected and I’m falling apart.

I don’t know how to feel about it.

A part of me wants to pull away.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried so hard to appear “normal” it’s like anything unexpected and I’m falling apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how to feel about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A part of me wants to pull away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I so messed up I can’t just enjoy this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else ever struggle with the same feelings?&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hi everyone, 
I’m literally laying in my bed in tears as I type this. Basically, my parents had me very young and ended up getting degrees later in life. Their goal for me was to get it on time. For the past four years it looked like I was going to be able to do it but I failed my last class and basically disappointed everyone and set my graduation back. The goal was to retake the class and pass but as the semester has gone by the odds of that keep dropping. I can’t pass the class because I’m not smart enough and I don’t know what to do. Everyone’s going to say I didn’t try but I did, sometimes I’ll spend hours in my room  just trying to get it. Having it online is not helping and I pretty much have to calm myself down before every exam.

I’ve always had thoughts of suicide growing up and even attempted once when I was younger but I ended up just throwing up (not very successful). I just don’t know what to do now. My family is super judge mental and I don’t think I can take being a failure. 

Part of me wants to graduate to please my mom but the other part of me just wants to quit. I’m currently living with her as I try to finish but everyday I feel like a burden. I know my stepdad is getting annoyed with me being there and honestly I just want to get away from everyone. I’ve been trying to get a job so that I can move out and figure things out on my own but I’m not getting any calls back. Having to fake like I’m okay is getting to be too much. I’ve been lying to my only friend about how everything is going and I thought about to just being honest with her but then decided not to so I don’t add my problems onto hers.

For the past week, my mind has been thinking about just ending everything. I feel like everyone would eventually get over it and then they won’t have to see me as a failure. I’m fat, I’m ugly, I’m dumb, and I don’t know what I’m living for anymore.

I don’t have anyone to talk to about things like this and it’s hard. I love my mother but she’s not very empathetic and thinks people should just get over things. But it’s not that easy for me. I tried getting into religion thinking that would help me but it hasn’t.

I haven’t properly combed my hair in a month. I stopped showering regularly. I don’t call people as much as I used. When I first started college, I had a drive to improve my life, that’s gone. Teeth don’t get brushed regularly. I’ve gained 20lbs. I’m falling apart. I want help, I just don’t know how to ask the people in my life for it,

,SuicideWatch,"Right now, things are easy, and I like the way things are going. I have friends who I care about and who care about me, people I can relate to. I've got a good family life, fun siblings and a loving mother. I'm currently in college getting high marks, higher grades than I ever had in my entire life, pursuing a subject I really enjoy. I have hobbies that I love, interests I love, life doesn't feel like a drag in the slightest. I'm happy. Like, I have it really good right now. But I really hope that in three to four years I have the courage to hang myself.

The world is getting *worse.* Like, holy shit, this world is getting so much worse for the working class and it's a little mind boggling. I despise this country. I hate it so much. I fucking despise everything about America and every single capitalist lie that gets shoved down people's throats, convincing them that working 60 hours a week just to possibly survive is normal, and justifiable. What a living nightmare we exist in. Currently, the field I'm pursuing only has good jobs in a few cities, and those cities have exorbitantly high cost of living. 2,000+ dollars a month for a small, unfurnished hole in the wall apartment building? And naturally, my field of work regularly has 10 hour days, 60-70 hour work weeks, that's generally the norm. And at first I thought to myself that this was just a unique, shitty feature of my preferred industry, but it really isn't. Everyone has to deal with such bullshit working conditions in order to meet the bare minimum of living, no matter what field. The workdays are meaningless, and they keep getting longer and longer and wages are getting worse and worse. This is affecting EVERYONE. And the younger you are, the worse you're going to have it. College debt will be something I have to deal with for the rest of my life, and for what? I do not want to be ground to dust for the rest of my adult life just so I can lay down for 10 hours a day on the one day per week I have off. Human beings should not have to live like this. It's inhumane, it's disgusting, and some inescapable climate apocalypse is going to bring about hell on Earth, even for wealthier countries.

Is this really *life?* Is this honestly what life is about? Is this what it all adds up to? We have a brief flash of freedom when we're in our teens, then we're driven into the dirt and feel like shit all of our lives. Then we try and tell other people ways we shouldn't feel like shit, even though everyone just feels like shit. Trying to convince ourselves that there's some mythic utopian life we can be living in which your wages can afford you everything you need to live plus savings and some disposable income for fun, and you don't have to work more than 40 hours a week (which, by the way, is completely unnecessary given the dramatic rise in productivity standards). In reality, everything just sucks when you're in the real world, and I honestly don't want to deal with any of that.

I want to live the next three years of my life the best I can, and ever since I convinced myself that I'll be dead in three years, I have felt amazing. I'll try anything I want, I'll take chances whenever I please, and it feels great. I feel so fucking liberated it's amazing. I don't have to deal with the consequences of anything if I don't want to. I just live, doing the best I can and doing whatever I want knowing that I have an easy out when the fun runs dry and life becomes a nightmare. It feels fucked up, but there's something so cathartic about always having a get out of jail free card. It allows me to do whatever I wish, and I don't want this lifestyle I've adopted to go away. I want to live free forever. But I can't. So when my freedom is gone, I'm going to kill myself, and I'll be happy about it. I won't let the world get to me.

Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again .

I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven’t told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I’m still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I’ve fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. 

I can’t bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don’t want to do this but I’ve run out of options . 

Furthermore my brothers and my 20th birthday is only in a couple of days , which adds to the pain . I’m so scared I’ve never done anything like this before and I’m so scared of the pain I will cause to my parents and family .

I can't take care of myself because I'm addicted to my phone and don't sleep until 10am to 5pm, and the lack of sunlight is putting my body in shock. But lately I've been barely sleeping at all. I want to buy some books to bring with me to the pysch ward to keep me busy because I need to be nursed back to health in a safe environment that reinforces healthy body schedules like the hospital.

But my grandpa's funeral service is this Tuesday and burial on Wednesday. I want to pull through long enough to attend that and perform some music for that, and immediately after I'll turn myself in. My family doesn't like me going to the hospital and they're against doctors and shit and think I'm putting myself in trouble while they're the ones responsible for my major depression and post traumatic stress disorder and insomnia.

I want to buy some books off Amazon, one about origami so I can fold some origami, a fiction book that'll keep me happy, and maybe a self help book on depression or managing my emotions.

I also wanna write down a list of funny jokes from r/Jokes to bring with me because everytime I've been to the psych ward the nurses have good laughs with me cuz I'm pretty chill and humorous and not violent towards anyone.

And also keep a list of phone numbers of my friends that I can call, my best friends that still support me, in case I want to talk to them.

I'm worried my mom won't take good care of my dog even tho she feeds him (very rarely the dog will get out the house cuz of her negligence and I'm the one who always brings him back)  or that my parents will get angry at me for going to the hospital and they might try and stop me, need some advice on that :(

I (tried?) To kill myself a few months ago, and short of  a literal miracle that means I'm dead. I remember I was in my car. I heard the gun go off. Then all I heard was my ears ringing. I use reloaded ammo and the only way this is possible is I shot one that didn't have powder in it. I had to push the bullet out of the barrel because it got stuck..

Outright saying ""You're not allowed sharing your no-no thoughts"" is the most frustratingly misunderstood and harmful thing you can do, and if you don't understand that, you're part of the problem.

Let's say that you are going to have a surgery where you are going to be put to sleep.

What can you take to make the general anesthesia a one way trip?

Alcohol is out of the question, too many ways to tell, need to take too much too close, thin blood, general demeanor

But what about certain pills or drugs?

,SuicideWatch,"     About a year ago, I came to this sub with a post asking for help. Some people were there for me, and I hope anyone that puts themselves in the position to help someone starving for a release from the pain they're enduring understands what they mean to those people.
After I told my story, I told people about how I kept myself alive. 
By stalling. 
     I have been stalling for the past year. I have tried and tried my absolute best to keep going. I have completely cut contact off with everyone and everything that was doing me harm mentally. My ex and I have not interacted. Though sometimes I catch myself checking her socials to make sure she is okay. The best friends that betrayed me, I do the same. I have tried my hardest to find a creative outlet. Which has lead me down some wonderful paths, which have seemingly faded into nonexistence as I have gotten worse. I have gained weight as a side effect to this. I have tried drowning myself in objects, a new $2000 pc. Every current generation console. A new BMX bike. My favorite foods. None of this had brought me more than an hour of happiness each. 
     I cannot help but lay in bed and think that this is it for me. Stalling until I cannot go on. Until I am but a piece of trash in some cosmic waste bin. Every night I think about taking my life, and every night I struggle to stall until I fall asleep. 
    Tonight, this is my stalling. I don't know if I can stall much longer, as everything I love has become but something I cant comprehend. My brain feels like it cannot work apart from when I'm stalling. I have mental breakdowns weekly. Im scared to leave my house because I live so close to my ex, and I feel like if I see her, I will implode. I just want to be normal. I miss ""before"". 
Before I was completely broken down, shredded up, and turned into this glob of unending greyness. 
     I genuinely do not think I can stall for another month, let alone another year. I feel like the only way I can get away from this is to give up.

What is change? What is time? What is life? Simply we cannot answer those questions exactly. I have been at the lowest you can go. And currently I am at the lowest point at the moment, I have these times when I know I want to make a change, to be better. Yet my own self contradicts me. I am my own enemy. I am my own guard. I don’t know why my mind is so against happiness, like ive said tons of times before happiness doesn’t want me. Simply I think how does one become happy? How do they....? I notice that I myself know I’m gonna die at a young age. It’s so sad to think like this but simply when someone says “there’s much more to life you have to have hope” those are meaningless words now....there is no hope. There isn’t much to life... I see that I am a negative person I wish to be someone very different. But I am stuck with this weight on my shoulders. I cry so hard bc I’m sad. I’m emotional. Maybe too much, but I cry so hard knowing that I want to be happy. That I want to feel important maybe it’s too much to ask. But I simply don’t get how people say they are so happy. I don’t wanna kill myself bc I’m simply too much of a coward. There had been moments that I wished nothing but death. I wanted to feel something. I guess at the end of the day it’s just a sad day. And this is all the time. I read this quote you see “sleep will never be enough if it’s your soul that’s tired” and I simply see the truth in this. You see no matter how much I sleep in and lay down. I’m constantly craving sleep. To be at rest for a bit. Getting through the day is hell but when I’m asleep I feel so loved and free. The world is sad. I’m sad. I feel I’m just not enough.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi reddit,

29/F here, for reference.  

I'm going to kill myself next week. I've been barely hanging on, and have felt myself slipping more and more recently. Typically, I hide how depressed I am. It has been so bad I cry every day. My parents noticed. 

My family is so messed up. My sister is insanely depressed, and I ask her to talk to me and she refuses. She's afraid I'll share all her shit with my mom. My brother is crazy. He's basically schizophrenic, but doesn't know it yet - flat earth, 5G, anti-vax, microchips... the whole sha-bang. My youngest sister is getting married this week. I held off until after her wedding. I want her to be happy. 

I'm alone, with no dependents. Everyone I love has someone else. I reached out to my best friend/fuck-buddy, and she's basically tired of my shit. I am not over dramatic, nor do I use suicide as a manipulative tool. I'm going to overdose next week. That's it. I'm serious about it. I'm finally ready to try to do it. 

I tried to overdose a few weeks ago. It was more impulsive than anything.. but it made me comfortable with it. I had bad side effects for a few days, but I got over it. I can go through that again if I fail, but I don't think I will. I know the dosage I need and everything. I've researched it for years. I thought it would be into my 30s, but I guess this is close enough. 

That's all. I am putting this out there secretly hoping someone from my life notices and reaches out. I don't really count on any of you, no offense, because I've posted here before and haven't heard anything back after a few replies. Everyone has their own lives, and an internet stranger is essentially a non-person. It's easy to get removed. I'm not upset, but just know I don't expect an insincere attempt at helping me. I want someone to care and be there for me and **stay**, but nobody ever does. 

People **always** leave.

I also have trichotillomania but I would never admit that to anyone I know.

lately when I'm doing work I get so anxious about my future and school that I can't focus on what I'm doing and end up wasting time, making myself feel even more shitty. my brain is scattered and cloudy and I can never have a full, clear thought. I get distracted so easily. I really have to get into college, but I don't think my parents believe I can (btw my parents are asian immigrants). I'm a above average student, I'm smarter than the average but not smart enough to be comparable to the students who take all ap classes/get a full score on the SATs/etc. when I was younger, I was praised and expected to be a ""star student"" and I stopped actually trying to put effort because I thought I was smart enough. I wish I didn't do that and I wish I studied harder in middle school. now I'm just lazy and unproductive. the only extracurricular stuff I've done is band/music/art stuff, but I don't even want to pursue music as a career. I've done nothing in my life and now it's coming back to fuck me over. I have nothing to show for the colleges.

I've been thinking about suicide since I was 13 and how everything would be so much better if I never existed, if I never felt pain or anything. I don't think I've ever self harmed but I've started banging my head whenever I'm under stress (which happens so randomly) and pulling my hair (as I mentioned earlier) to try to cope with it. I know it's bad for my health but I can't help it and I don't know how to stop. sometimes I imagine myself dead from drowning in the bathtub of my mom's bathroom, limp and lifeless. sometimes I get a quick urge to take a scissor or the nearest sharpest object and stab myself in the eye. I can't tell anyone about this because they won't listen, my parents never really received mental health education so they wouldn't get it, I'm too distanced from my friends and they probably think I'm fine because I act like it, and a therapist would most likely be impossible and too expensive. nobody in my life fucking knows and understands any of this. 

the only reasons why I'm still alive is that I don't want my mom to think how much money she wasted on me and I don't want one of my best friends to feel responsible for me. I don't want my friends to suffer or cry because I'm dead.

but I want to die. I don't know what my future is going to be like, if I don't get a job and earn money in the future what the fuck is the point? how am I going to live like that? if I'm going to die I hope I die sooner than later. also im trans and my parents &amp; most people don't know and I fucking hate it when someone calls me by the wrong pronouns (obviously it's not their fault but still). every time someone make a transphobic remark towards me (both online and irl) it makes me want to die. I don't have a fucking place in society, the whole world is terrible, and nobody actually cares about me. I'm a waste of everything and my brain doesn't function like a normal person's brain does and all I can do is pretend everything is fine and hope a car accidentally runs me over and kills me so I don't have to deal with any of this anymore.

I don&amp;#39;t know what my future is going to be like, if I don&amp;#39;t get a job and earn money in the future what the fuck is the point? how am I going to live like that? if I&amp;#39;m going to die I hope I die sooner than later. also im trans and my parents &amp;amp; most people don&amp;#39;t know and I fucking hate it when someone calls me by the wrong pronouns (obviously it&amp;#39;s not their fault but still). every time someone make a transphobic remark towards me (both online and irl) it makes me want to die. I don&amp;#39;t have a fucking place in society, the whole world is terrible, and nobody actually cares about me. I&amp;#39;m a waste of everything and my brain doesn&amp;#39;t function like a normal person&amp;#39;s brain does and all I can do is pretend everything is fine and hope a car accidentally runs me over and kills me so I don&amp;#39;t have to deal with any of this anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sorry about the long post, I don&amp;#39;t know if anyone will read this. I&amp;#39;ve kept this suicidal feeling in for years and just needed to let it all out somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

It's a nightmare  I'm posting here because I wanna be heard, I have  nothing to lose I have no family no friends and the person whom I cared for and loved so much, left me because of my past because I was destined to be stabbed and treated  wrong for the rest of my life ? and I am witness to my mistakes in the past never been to jail never broken the rules too much never been a drinker or a party guy too much. I was born in a different country called Panama between north and south america, my mom left me in that country 1 year after I was born, she left with my siblings my oldest sister and brother, I was raised by my grandfather and grandma they were all fantastic and good parents to me throught my childhood till I was 6 and my grandfather died of cancer all suddenly lung and throat cancer even tho he had quit many years b4 but I guess still happened. Then my mom called and told my grandma to not put me in the school for the whole year cuz she was coming to get me, she was currently living in the US and became a citizen, so the whole year went by and never came and got me. I was disappointed, I was then raped by someone who my grandma left me with after school the next year after I I turned 7 I never remember the incident for a long time.
6 years later she somehow came and got me with my new green card, I was removed from my friends and everyone I once knew and was very close to .
A month after I got here not knowing English at all was sent to middle middle school and 2 years behind because of my language barrier I was put in a advance esl  class for the whole year my teacher was a bad teacher and used to lose her shit with me because it was hard for me to concentrate, used to call me stupid becUse out of all the 12 students there, I was the only one not talking much but is because I was intimidated, somehow I passed the class and left that school from Dallas, I then moved to McKinney Texas and went to high school there, i did a whole year there and then my mom and my brothers and I, had to move to Dallas again during winter, we then moved to mesquite tx and stayed there for 5 years on and off becUse me and my mother got into it many times because she always treated me as different than my siblings so i started not caring and just left high school and started living with friends since I was 16 and 17 I was out and doing my own things for a little while I even moved to Oklahoma then back to Dallas and had my first 2 childs with two different woman one fucked me over and the other one just kinda  kept me out and my other one fucked me over and cheated on me while I was a at work, she would call her ex husband and take off with my daughter and never paid a thing in my apartment I cooked and cleaned when I could after work, I worked in a commercial printing warehouse and I worked almost every day maybe one day off and, somehow my green card went missing out of my wallet and a week after that, everything  started to hit me hard, my ex had waited till I got fired and then I went to take a nape with my daughter so i could wake up and have energy for my next move, but when I woke up, my newborn daughter took off with my daughter and my car and then i called cops but they couldn't help because that was her mother but if I would had been awake would have been a different story, I then got into a big depression i let some friends stay there while i would go to work and stay at my .moms for a while cuz the job was close to her house, and but I couldn't keep paying for my apartment no more becaUse my new job didn't paid me enough and then I had no ride to go to my old place because those friends stopped responding, and my parents wouldn't take me so I then find out that those friends of mine got cops called on my place and they were trying to run drugs and party hard there and so they got caught and I didn't have enough time to go get my things and leave so I lost everything I had, and now that I had no green card I could not find any jobs that would hire me so I met another chick who also cheated on me and got pregnant and didn't tell. Me and so a year passed by and after I got with this burnt survivor chick, my ex finds my number and texted me asking me 8f I wanted to meet my son and I did and he looked like me and we had a connection within a few weeks of been meeting up with him, 4 weeks later she asked me and my girlfriend at the time if we could take care of him because she couldn't and she didn't want him and I was all excited but I was living with that burned chick and I only donated plasma and did odd jobs from time to time to help but then Anastasia which was the burnt chick, got all excited and said she wanted to help me get my kids back and so I thought was strange but I accepted and thanked her for it but after a few months of him staying with us and making me very happy, Anastasia starts telling me that she called CPS on. My sons mom. Because she wanted to have my kid living with us without her ever coming back for him which  it bothered me becUse that was kind of unnecessary and so my ex's kid got taken away and my son was then. Involved with CPS under some type of plan, to keep my sons mother away from my son, then a year or so passed by and Anastasia starts to act different and accuse me of shit because she had PTSD and other mental issues and so she was the type to wake up in the middle of the night screaming, or punching u, or to start a fight, and one night she took it too far and I had to grab my son from the bed because she started arguing with me and swinging her hands around like a child, I was afraid for me and my son and so she got up and while I had my half sleep baby on my. Arms she tried swinging at me so I turned my body and turned again and grabbed her arm and slightly pushed her onto the bed so I tried walking out with my son and she then ran to the front door and blocked me from going anywhere so I freaked out and called the cops and so I get her to calm down and I then the cops come and hear my story and hers but she was lying to them saying I hit her when I never hit no woman I told them. That I was defending my self and my son and that she hit me and I showed my Mark's and I told them I did pushed her because she was way too close to me while acting odd, so then she gets taken away and they asked me to press charges and but I never did because I felt bad and I did care for her and I didn't want to do that to my son so the day I went to sign the documents releasing her from her going to court, but also mostly because she begged me and begged. Me and also asked my mom to get her to get me to just not press charges on Anastasia and believe it or not I signed it and gave her the benefit if the doubt but the moment i did that, she went and called her parents and told them all of the things that happened and made me look horrible, why?, I have no idea, so then I started doing drugs because she got sick and got taken to the hospital I had to take care of my kid alone for a few months and had no job so had to come up with ways, I used drugs to keep up with my shoes because I was so tired, I was known around the complex because I was working on people's cars while I had my son at day care paid by cps, I got addicted but never let it keep me away from taking care of my kid but then she came back for 2 weeks I had to help her off the bed and to shower and to do all sorts of things and her treating me like shit everyday and screaming and omg it was the most stressful thing and was messing with me and then she went. Back to the hospital for 2 more months and then she comes back and made my life hell because I told her I was doing drugs and told her why but then I thought I could trust her but she turned out to be the devil and used that against me and started pushing me back and while I would go out to make money, she would go behind my back and assume i was cheating or God knows what when I was at work I had witnes3s, but she was also signing documents and suddenly I wasnt getting any kind of taxes so she started getting ng all of this money and I didn't know how taxes worked but when I did find out she was keeping all of this money from having my child living with us I got mad and confronted her about it cuz non of it was going to him we had all of his toys donated to us so where was this money going and so she would say she had it hidden for him and I just left it alone but then I had a bad feeling so I asked her when could she help me find a way to have me sign my sons birth certificate but because of my legal situation I couldn't do it my self, so I made her have power of attorney and she said she would help me but never did instead she would lie to me till the very end then got me caught up with CPS and locked.me out of the house and took off with my kid and I never got to sign it and then cps found meth in my system and so yay, now I was stuck with this embarrassing shit and after passing everything for 8 months. They kept lying to me telling g me I would see him as long I comply and I did the best I could but then I got with the woman of my dreams and but my ex found out about her and threw cps on her and her daughter and I 3nded moving with her temporarily and then months go by and now my current woman was getting very stressed out blaming me for her having cps on her for no reason. Just jealousy I guess and I got under alot of pressure and hurt by everything i was doing to help others and trying my best to do better at life I end up moving to my friends home and my coworker and we would work on his house on cars he was my teacher but my cousin dies and my uncle died too from covid and so I lost my shit and started doing meth again 2 wise and somehow I blacked out and messaged my friends brother and my best friends 14 or 16 year old daughter and I couldn't remember and I then lost my job and my best friend and then I apologized to them and couldn't believe that i did that and i feel so bad every day. And but i was still with my woman and i told her what i knew and to forgive me but i never seen anyone behind her back i was very truthful to her but after months of knowing then that guy calls cps on me about it saying I sent a nude to a minor or solicited to a minor and the worst part is that I ain't even that type of person fuck no and I felt disgusted and I wanted to hung my self because  I was on drugs my woman lied to the cps guy so he could leave us,  me alone and I thanked her, but ever since, she has not been the same, i don't wanna lose her she  is my everything because we help each other and thanks to her i have been staying clean thanks to her I treat her like my queen but today she told me she wanted to leave me because of the past and she just wanted to be loved again was the only reason I was chosen to be with her but now because my past even tho I was truthful, she doesn't trust me  thinking that if I do drugs again I would probably do that again. And I promised her I wouldn't but is my word vs everyone else's I feel like the world is against me even tho I only have eyes for her and good heart for others.

,SuicideWatch,"Sorry for the long post...

If you wish for more background regarding our relationship, you can check my previous posts in my profile... please don't judge the age gap, it's not what we need right now...

She's been depressed for the last few weeks, because she feels like her life is falling apart:
- Her toxic ex with his toxic new family keeps getting in her life... and since the girl is their daughter, he will never ""leave forever"". She's been trying to file a proper separation since March-April, and finally contacted a lawyer a few weeks ago (apparently thanks to me, because she would had never felt brave enough by herself)... but this got her more badly that either of us could ever think, feeling like a failure... not giving her daughter a true family. Meanwhile, since she still has to stay in touch with her ex because of their daughter, he keeps insulting her, calling her names (especially once she told him about me), a ""whore"", someone who ""wants someone young just to fuck"", a ""disgrace to her daughter""... even IN FRONT of their daughter! Threatening to ""tell her what her shameful mother does""... 

- She's left her working place last year after 20 years because she knew she could do much more with her life... to actually feel ""alive"". Therefore she's started studying (that's how we met)... but being older than most students, she feels like she can't keep up, and although she's passed a few exams, she couldn't make it with the last one (which required MONTHS to be studied, with her sacrificing for it any time she had... to the point where we agreed not to meet to often until she was done). And with the new semester having started and the many lectures she should actively attend (even 12 consecutive hours on some days!), she's been thinking about just giving up on University, feeling like an idiot for even trying.

- Although she LOVES with her whole heart her daughter... she realizes she requires almost all of her time and energy. Again, sacrificing our time together, her studies... and ""her life"". I've always reassured her that her daughter must come first, and that I can be patient and wait for the right time to meet. And she's been living with her mother since she's broken up with her ex, but she's starting to develop dementia. But to top it all... she still depends on her ex to keep the daughter when she can't (and he depends on her himself). He just reschedules his life in order to screw up hers, involves her in the issues he has with his own first daughter he had from a previous marriage (14 years old... once, she ran off to ""meet her boyfriend she met online"")... and is always lurking around since they live close, keeping an eye on her... and still asking her to get back together!
So... she's feeling trapped. No escape.

- And then there's me... I dealt with depression myself in the past, so I've started living only recently (worked whole least year, started to study to get a proper job, got a driving license...)... but I still live with my parents, who have always been toxic, manipulative and extremely protective. I need a year and a half to end my studies, and I'll finally be 100% independent.
We've been extremely happy together, to the point that she's told me that she's never lived such a relationship before, as if she was living the actual ""first love"", made of emotions and not just ""mechanical"". But... she's also told me that she thought I was more independent. And since I had to even FAKE a break up with her since my family was freaking out about it, I got even less freedom, and started having to lie to them, repeatedly, just to see her as much as I could. I myself felt more and more confident about planning things... even a couple of travels! But I can't give her all the help I wish I could... when she talks about having someone by her side, to live a proper family with, I wish that could already be me... but I still need to finally put together the basis my life before. At least get a proper job to contribute.

Starting with the separation, I noticed something was off... she asked me for time for herself, to think about it and her life (again, it was a hit heavier than she thought on her)... I gave it to her, not meeting up but still keeping in contact, every day.
The quarrels with her ex got worse and worse... while videochatting, she started crying and telling me she couldn't take it anymore, that she has never done anything wrong in her life and yet kept having everything against her. Of course, I always tried to reassure her, to distract her with anything else, all the positive and lightier things in her life... she would always smile at the end, thanking me for being there for her.

She started having heavy mood swings... she had already tried a couple of times to break up with me because apparently I ""need to live my own life with a young girl, not waste it after a deluded old one"". It worked only the very first time, when I myself had my doubts, only for us to get back together a few hours later, missing each other and realizing we're ""a couple of autodestructive idiots"". 
But this attitude showed up more and more lately, because I ""shouldn't waste time with a woman whose life is just falling apart"", and I always told her I would never leave just because something's wrong... I love her too much. This happened probably 3 times in the last weeks, always followed by words of love from her, about how lucky she is of having me...
Last time, she asked me to ""detach from her"" because she didn't want her depression to get to me, since I ""can live a great life without her"". Absolutely no, I refused.

But she got quieter and quieter. We haven't met for 19 days now, although we're messaging and calling each other EVERY day... we should had met two Saturdays ago, but turns out her lawyer for the separation tested positive fro COVID, so she had to stay isolated for a while (she resulted negative in the end); we should had met last Friday, but her ex rescheduled at the last minute and couldn't keep their daughter, so she had to; we should had met last Monday, but forgot she had new lectures, and since she's not doing well we don't want her to skip classes; we should had met today... but she's ""feeling dead inside"", and in the last couple days she's only wanted to sleep, more and more, even skipping schedules...

She's dealt with depression already in her past, so she knows a psychologist she trusts that she hasn't met for a while, since things were good. She met her yesterday, and the psychologist told her she's ""never seen her so destroyed"", diagnosing her with huge depression, probably also caused by her illness (she has lupus, which untreated correctly can lead to depression).

And when I called her to know about what the psychologist told her... while talking about other things, she suddenly told me, in a whisper and on the verge of crying, she's thought about suicide, and that she keeps going just for her daughter. 
...I can't deny I thought about it, but of course never brought it up in order not to trigger something. I know she's thought about it years ago, but succeeded by herself on refusing and seeking help... so I worried she could get such thoughts. I tried to say something... that's it's a way for our mind to find an escape... an extreme escape... that she should not feed such thought... and I was at a loss of what to say. I didn't know what to say to help her. While I was speaking though, she changed the subject and I followed it...
Half an hour after our call, she wrote me ""thank you for supporting me, and being there when I'm giving you the worst part of me"".

So, we should had met today. I hoped I could finally do something more for her by meeting in presence... even just a hug, to make her feel safer. I've been wishing for it for weeks now. I don't expect to magically cure her depression... but at least, to give her some happy moments...
...but when I wrote her our usual good morning... she replied that she won't make it today. It's too tiring, she doesn't feel the strength... she's feeling dead. She would had just brought her daughter to school, and then gone back home to sleep more. I suggested her I could reach her to her place, so she doesn't have to move... but she refused and asked me not to insist. I agreed, told her I'd be waiting for her messages, and told her I love her.

...I don't know what to do. I've been crying the whole day, not because I can't meet her... but because I'm scared she could do something awful. Yesterday she didn't appear online on any social for 4 hours, which is unusual for her... I started panicking, thinking something happened since she was alone at home, the daughter was at school... but in the end she was just sleeping...

I don't know if I should message her or if I should just give her time and wait for her to contact me... if I should tell her again I'm just worried (thus worrying/upsetting her), or write about anything else (looking as if I don't care)... if I should LOOK/SOUND worried or strong to her... if I should reach her place regardless of what she thinks is good for her now, or respect any boundaries she asks for...

If she asks me how I am... how should I reply?? ""Awful because I'm worried"" (the truth, but making her feel more of a burden), or something else thus looking as if I didn't care?

I'm powerless, and all I have is long distance communication... I've always helped her in everything, to the point where once she was moved and on the verge of crying for how much I care for her... but I don't know how to help her now.

&lt;p&gt;If you wish for more background regarding our relationship, you can check my previous posts in my profile... please don&amp;#39;t judge the age gap, it&amp;#39;s not what we need right now...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s been depressed for the last few weeks, because she feels like her life is falling apart:
- Her toxic ex with his toxic new family keeps getting in her life... and since the girl is their daughter, he will never &amp;quot;leave forever&amp;quot;. She&amp;#39;s been trying to file a proper separation since March-April, and finally contacted a lawyer a few weeks ago (apparently thanks to me, because she would had never felt brave enough by herself)... but this got her more badly that either of us could ever think, feeling like a failure... not giving her daughter a true family. Meanwhile, since she still has to stay in touch with her ex because of their daughter, he keeps insulting her, calling her names (especially once she told him about me), a &amp;quot;whore&amp;quot;, someone who &amp;quot;wants someone young just to fuck&amp;quot;, a &amp;quot;disgrace to her daughter&amp;quot;... even IN FRONT of their daughter! Threatening to &amp;quot;tell her what her shameful mother does&amp;quot;... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s left her working place last year after 20 years because she knew she could do much more with her life... to actually feel &amp;quot;alive&amp;quot;. Therefore she&amp;#39;s started studying (that&amp;#39;s how we met)... but being older than most students, she feels like she can&amp;#39;t keep up, and although she&amp;#39;s passed a few exams, she couldn&amp;#39;t make it with the last one (which required MONTHS to be studied, with her sacrificing for it any time she had... to the point where we agreed not to meet to often until she was done). And with the new semester having started and the many lectures she should actively attend (even 12 consecutive hours on some days!), she&amp;#39;s been thinking about just giving up on University, feeling like an idiot for even trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she LOVES with her whole heart her daughter... she realizes she requires almost all of her time and energy. Again, sacrificing our time together, her studies... and &amp;quot;her life&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve always reassured her that her daughter must come first, and that I can be patient and wait for the right time to meet. And she&amp;#39;s been living with her mother since she&amp;#39;s broken up with her ex, but she&amp;#39;s starting to develop dementia. But to top it all... she still depends on her ex to keep the daughter when she can&amp;#39;t (and he depends on her himself). He just reschedules his life in order to screw up hers, involves her in the issues he has with his own first daughter he had from a previous marriage (14 years old... once, she ran off to &amp;quot;meet her boyfriend she met online&amp;quot;)... and is always lurking around since they live close, keeping an eye on her... and still asking her to get back together!
So... she&amp;#39;s feeling trapped. No escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s me... I dealt with depression myself in the past, so I&amp;#39;ve started living only recently (worked whole least year, started to study to get a proper job, got a driving license...)... but I still live with my parents, who have always been toxic, manipulative and extremely protective. I need a year and a half to end my studies, and I&amp;#39;ll finally be 100% independent.
We&amp;#39;ve been extremely happy together, to the point that she&amp;#39;s told me that she&amp;#39;s never lived such a relationship before, as if she was living the actual &amp;quot;first love&amp;quot;, made of emotions and not just &amp;quot;mechanical&amp;quot;. But... she&amp;#39;s also told me that she thought I was more independent. And since I had to even FAKE a break up with her since my family was freaking out about it, I got even less freedom, and started having to lie to them, repeatedly, just to see her as much as I could. I myself felt more and more confident about planning things... even a couple of travels! But I can&amp;#39;t give her all the help I wish I could... when she talks about having someone by her side, to live a proper family with, I wish that could already be me... but I still need to finally put together the basis my life before. At least get a proper job to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with the separation, I noticed something was off... she asked me for time for herself, to think about it and her life (again, it was a hit heavier than she thought on her)... I gave it to her, not meeting up but still keeping in contact, every day.
The quarrels with her ex got worse and worse... while videochatting, she started crying and telling me she couldn&amp;#39;t take it anymore, that she has never done anything wrong in her life and yet kept having everything against her. Of course, I always tried to reassure her, to distract her with anything else, all the positive and lightier things in her life... she would always smile at the end, thanking me for being there for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She started having heavy mood swings... she had already tried a couple of times to break up with me because apparently I &amp;quot;need to live my own life with a young girl, not waste it after a deluded old one&amp;quot;. It worked only the very first time, when I myself had my doubts, only for us to get back together a few hours later, missing each other and realizing we&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;a couple of autodestructive idiots&amp;quot;. 
But this attitude showed up more and more lately, because I &amp;quot;shouldn&amp;#39;t waste time with a woman whose life is just falling apart&amp;quot;, and I always told her I would never leave just because something&amp;#39;s wrong... I love her too much. This happened probably 3 times in the last weeks, always followed by words of love from her, about how lucky she is of having me...
Last time, she asked me to &amp;quot;detach from her&amp;quot; because she didn&amp;#39;t want her depression to get to me, since I &amp;quot;can live a great life without her&amp;quot;. Absolutely no, I refused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she got quieter and quieter. We haven&amp;#39;t met for 19 days now, although we&amp;#39;re messaging and calling each other EVERY day... we should had met two Saturdays ago, but turns out her lawyer for the separation tested positive fro COVID, so she had to stay isolated for a while (she resulted negative in the end); we should had met last Friday, but her ex rescheduled at the last minute and couldn&amp;#39;t keep their daughter, so she had to; we should had met last Monday, but forgot she had new lectures, and since she&amp;#39;s not doing well we don&amp;#39;t want her to skip classes; we should had met today... but she&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;feeling dead inside&amp;quot;, and in the last couple days she&amp;#39;s only wanted to sleep, more and more, even skipping schedules...&lt;/p&gt;

My grades are all F’s and I am going to fail the semester. I’m fat and disgusting and don’t even bother looking in the mirror anymore. If no one is here for me then what’s the point of anything? There is none. I am not going to succeed at anything and my life is just a fucking joke. I deserve to suffer. I deserve whatever’s coming to me next.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hey Reddit,

I have had a lot of luck in life I  think. Good, loving family, great friends and girlfriend. I was at the peak of my life last year. Finishing college, had a job almost guaranteed and was recognized as a great worker. I was making a nice profit from a sports betting side project. I remember thinking how great life was going to be like this.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I was kicked out of college. Basically, I screwed up in my early years and had bad grades, had a written arrangement with the college to prove myself with good grades, which I did, but after many formal meetings and ""sueing"" them within the college's lawyer for students, they had the right to refuse me for whatever reason regardless of the grades. My job, which was a student job with the government, was terminated since being a student was obligatory. A week later, a friend of mine spills water on my 4000$ laptop (won at a contest) and I lose my side project of sports betting.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an optimistic guy, but I could name a thousand more examples recently in which I'm trying to get my life back on track, and I get sidelined over some reason, and it's starting to make no sense. Past two years, I lost 4 family members unexpectedly and wasn't able to say goodbye so fast they were gone, I have been able to put that aside and self reflect on how that makes me feel for later, but recently with everything I try to invest myself falling apart, I'm really starting to believe there's something or someone that pushes me down and makes me lose everything I have. I'm scared to do everyday actions, opening a letter is a nightmare, I think about what bad news I'll have and it's driving me crazy. I don't want to upset my girlfriend and our next step was to have a family (when I had a job), so I try to look optimistic, but I am scared shitless. Every time I try to get back up I get kicked a flight of stairs, I'm a reasonable and logic guy, but fucking damnit, what are the odds of everything happening to me to be simply circumstances?

,SuicideWatch,"I grew up with a very optimistic perspective on the future. I had dreams, hopes and aspirations and I was always validated by the people around me for being 'special'. I am not fucking special. I never was.

&amp;nbsp;

I cannot believe how much of a loser I am. Two years ago, when I got my degree, I was in awe. I thought that was the solution to my issues. I thought I would be successful in life and that everything would eventually turn out fine. College was extremely stressful and traumatic and I really had high hopes for the future, hopes of having better and more enjoyable times ahead of me. Once I got out of college I was hit by the realization that I wasn't particularly skilled at anything. And I didn't enjoy anything either. Also, soon enough, I realized that my degree was useless and that it wasn't going to help me in finding a good job. I eventually got my first job two years ago, shortly after graduating. It was a shitty retail job at a local store. I hated the guts out of it and I was treated like garbage by everyone because I was always overly-emotional and fucked up a lot. I left that job but was unable to find something better. I eventually settled for another average job, working for a casino. Still minimum wage and lots of stress but at least I had a better schedule and it allowed me to ""self-improve"" (or that's what I thought at the time, lol). I've been working there for a year and a half and I've hated **every second** of it. I got to see the dark side of people and addiction in general...people spending their last penny on slot machines, people breaking down in tears, smashing stuff around them, swearing and even threatening me for their lack of self-control. Now I'm searching for a different job but my shit degree doesn't qualify me for anything except for being a teacher, which I've realized that I would hate doing (I've done it for a short period when I was in college and hated it with a passion). 

&amp;nbsp;

I hate everything, but I hate myself even more. I am a **LOSER**, I am no one. I can't seem to muster up the motivation to do something with my life. I always made plans to start an online course or even try to get a better degree, but I always cancelled those plans because I'm too much of a coward. Also my ability to learn things pretty much plummeted in college, when I was barely able to get through 2 pages without wanting to kill myself. I wish I had a valid fucking reason for being such a failure but I have nothing to say in my defense. Every single time I tried to do something to better myself, I failed miserably and only proved myself that I'm a fucking disaster who will never get anything out of life. Right now I'm struggling with driving school and I almost crashed into another car yesterday during practice. I have never heard of anyone struggling so much with driving school, yet here I am, being unable to do basic things such as learning a course or driving a fucking car. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've been severely depressed and suicidal for years. Mental illness robbed me of a happy, normal life. I've been unable to have a realtionship or maintain healthy, normal long term frienships because I have the emotional maturity of a 5 year old. I've been on dozens of SSRIs and generally a lot of med combos that only fucked me up even more. Therapy hasn't helped a bit either, and it only fucked me up more because I spent so much money on therapy in the past few years. I could have done so much more if I hadn't wasted it on something that never helped anyway. The past few monts were rough. I made plans to kill myself but again, I was too much of a coward to actually go through it (and my previous unsuccesful attempt discouraged me too much). So instead I ended up getting drunk every night, crying myself to sleep then continuing to get high throughout the day. I constantly wanted to call in sick to work and while I was at work I actually called my boss to ask if I could go to the pharma during the shift because I couldn't take the pain anymore. I would constantly fuck myself up on Xanax, it was the only way I could get through work. I almost ended up at the ER because of my lifestyle. I haven't eaten a cooked meal in weeks (all I've been eating is potato chips and junk food). I had a mental breakdown and ended up cutting my long hair, smashing random objects around the house, and contemplating suicide by sitting on my balcony at 4 AM, wanting to jump but not doing it out of fear (also, pretty much i wouldn't have died from such a low height, but the impulse was still present). I just don't know what to do. I know many will tell me to seek help, but I did seek help multiple times and I'm still a wreck. I do not deserve help, because I am too much of an  idiot to even be alive. I just want to sleep and never wake up again.

I had dreams, hopes and aspirations and I was always validated by the people around me for being &amp;#39;special&amp;#39;. I am not fucking special. I never was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cannot believe how much of a loser I am. Two years ago, when I got my degree, I was in awe. I thought that was the solution to my issues. I thought I would be successful in life and that everything would eventually turn out fine. College was extremely stressful and traumatic and I really had high hopes for the future, hopes of having better and more enjoyable times ahead of me. Once I got out of college I was hit by the realization that I wasn&amp;#39;t particularly skilled at anything. And I didn&amp;#39;t enjoy anything either. Also, soon enough, I realized that my degree was useless and that it wasn&amp;#39;t going to help me in finding a good job. I eventually got my first job two years ago, shortly after graduating. It was a shitty retail job at a local store. I hated the guts out of it and I was treated like garbage by everyone because I was always overly-emotional and fucked up a lot. I left that job but was unable to find something better. I eventually settled for another average job, working for a casino. Still minimum wage and lots of stress but at least I had a better schedule and it allowed me to &amp;quot;self-improve&amp;quot; (or that&amp;#39;s what I thought at the time, lol). I&amp;#39;ve been working there for a year and a half and I&amp;#39;ve hated &lt;strong&gt;every second&lt;/strong&gt; of it. I got to see the dark side of people and addiction in general...people spending their last penny on slot machines, people breaking down in tears, smashing stuff around them, swearing and even threatening me for their lack of self-control. Now I&amp;#39;m searching for a different job but my shit degree doesn&amp;#39;t qualify me for anything except for being a teacher, which I&amp;#39;ve realized that I would hate doing (I&amp;#39;ve done it for a short period when I was in college and hated it with a passion). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate everything, but I hate myself even more. I am a &lt;strong&gt;LOSER&lt;/strong&gt;, I am no one. I can&amp;#39;t seem to muster up the motivation to do something with my life. I always made plans to start an online course or even try to get a better degree, but I always cancelled those plans because I&amp;#39;m too much of a coward. Also my ability to learn things pretty much plummeted in college, when I was barely able to get through 2 pages without wanting to kill myself. I wish I had a valid fucking reason for being such a failure but I have nothing to say in my defense. Every single time I tried to do something to better myself, I failed miserably and only proved myself that I&amp;#39;m a fucking disaster who will never get anything out of life. Right now I&amp;#39;m struggling with driving school and I almost crashed into another car yesterday during practice. I have never heard of anyone struggling so much with driving school, yet here I am, being unable to do basic things such as learning a course or driving a fucking car. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been severely depressed and suicidal for years. Mental illness robbed me of a happy, normal life. I&amp;#39;ve been unable to have a realtionship or maintain healthy, normal long term frienships because I have the emotional maturity of a 5 year old. I&amp;#39;ve been on dozens of SSRIs and generally a lot of med combos that only fucked me up even more. Therapy hasn&amp;#39;t helped a bit either, and it only fucked me up more because I spent so much money on therapy in the past few years. I could have done so much more if I hadn&amp;#39;t wasted it on something that never helped anyway. The past few monts were rough. I made plans to kill myself but again, I was too much of a coward to actually go through it (and my previous unsuccesful attempt discouraged me too much). So instead I ended up getting drunk every night, crying myself to sleep then continuing to get high throughout the day. I constantly wanted to call in sick to work and while I was at work I actually called my boss to ask if I could go to the pharma during the shift because I couldn&amp;#39;t take the pain anymore. I would constantly fuck myself up on Xanax, it was the only way I could get through work. I almost ended up at the ER because of my lifestyle. I haven&amp;#39;t eaten a cooked meal in weeks (all I&amp;#39;ve been eating is potato chips and junk food). I had a mental breakdown and ended up cutting my long hair, smashing random objects around the house, and contemplating suicide by sitting on my balcony at 4 AM, wanting to jump but not doing it out of fear (also, pretty much i wouldn&amp;#39;t have died from such a low height, but the impulse was still present).

I do not deserve help, because I am too much of an  idiot to even be alive. I just want to sleep and never wake up again.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Let's start with modern events. My mother was in the CIA and not only had she given me a supreme love and appreciation for what they do, she has shown me how much they give up to do it -- they give up, on some level, their freedom so that others can have theirs. This damages their sense of self so badly that they can develop mixed depression, anxiety, PTSD and BPD as well as NPD on top of it. Imagine having that as your mother, no matter how understandable the reasoning behind it is. Seeing certain aspects of her job crushed and used politically for either side actually damages a part of my self-identity, as I often used them as a standard for myself to measure up to as I've inherited many of her less beneficial traits **and** acquired PTSD from her (and my school's) treatment of me.

Alone, it's a huge weight to bear -- my past, for better and worse. However, remember how I said I had inherited many of her less beneficial traits? I'm autistic. I have ADHD. I have major depressive disorder, as well as anxiety on top. I also have PTSD. These things *prevent* me from working -- from taking proper instruction, from learning like everyone else, to even handling certain objects because of their texture or how they sound or feel (I would rather be NAKED than have sand in my boots, for example, and I will take my clothing off instead of 'dealing with' the sensations, they're so unbearable.)

I also have an IQ of... I think, 163 as tested when I was around 7. I'm AWARE of all of this. I'm trapped in some weird sack of meat that doesn't cooperate with me. I share a symbiotic relationship with it, and I love it dearly, but it's just so heart-breaking to have so many people expect so much of me because of a number everyone -- supposedly -- assumes is meaningless for good reason. They ignore, for example, the fact I even can wound myself so badly with a single centimeter-deep gash that the floor is covered in blood. It really would have been nice if the people in my past took my advice and just let me get a lethal dose of morphine to put an end to my suffer, but I'm so afraid now that my future is solely me as either a hunter-gatherer -- illegal -- or me as a criminal, the likes of which have died early or hurt so many people because of their cunning.

Maybe someone knows what to do.. I can&amp;#39;t live like this anymore, there is no end.. why did born?&lt;/p&gt;

.They are homophobic and transphobic so when I  show emotion they say man up.They are religious (we will get in to that later).They also work helping the mentally ill.The last thing you need to know is my parents were fighting for 5 years now and got divorced a year ago (me and my sister live in 2 houses)

&amp;#x200B;

For me I felt terrible about 2 years ago and when my parents got a divorce I felt suicidal.1 month ago I took  a deep breath and told my mom im always stressed and suicidal.My dad is very religous so if I told him he would just talk about god being on my side.I told my mom that while they are not abusive they scream at me a lot and say we are dissapointments but then tell us (me and my sister) ok now get good grades and become rich (remeber im only 11 and she is 13).My mom said that I need to take deep breaths and remeber life will get tough but you have to keep those thoughts out your mind.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom in her life went through a lot of stress during the divorce in particular because she had to refinance the house and got no help from my dad.She thought of suicide one day but got over it quick with thinking god can help me.So  i said deep breaths help but it is not a cure.Word for Word I said ""I think i need to get tested for anxiety.""She snapped saying you control and you do not have a mental illness."" This because she works with people so close to killing themself they are taken seriously or people with Schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.I took a doctors approved test from the mayo clinic saying i score 18 out of 21 on the anxiety scale and i have severe anxiety snd 20 out of 28 on the deppresion scale also severe.

&amp;#x200B;

My moms thinking is that people confirmed to have deppresion or anxiety have gone through things like losing a loved one or divorce witch are causes.It is also confirmed that your parents getting divorced is also a cause (which probably caused it if i do have it.)So at this point if I cant get treated why live just so i can suffer.If anyone has a way for me to mabye get therapy or even tested by a doctor please tell me in the comments.

I don't even have friends to invite if I wanted to. I really thought I was going to have a party that people would want to attend. People don't even like me. My family doesn't even like me.

,SuicideWatch,"I’ve had depression, and anxiety since I was maybe 14 years old, and a drinking problem since I was 17 or so. 

My parents have always been supportive, and I’ve been talking to therapists, and doctors since then. I’m 29 now. 

I’ve been able to take care of all my appointments and meds since about 23, because I make really good money even without insurance. My dad helped me open up my own company, and we do really well. 

5 years ago, I hired a secretary. We immediately fell for each other, and she quit so we could be together. 

A little over 2 years ago, we got married, and now we have a 1 year old son, and her 6 year old daughter. My wife makes great money in real estate. 

About a year ago, we bought our forever house. 

Everything seems really fucking great for me right? 

I hate my life. Every day is a struggle to keep the wheels turning. Between running a business, and taking care of kids until they go to sleep, always fixing shit around the house, and paying bills, I’ve got no energy left. 

All of these issues were manageable about 6 months ago, when business was booming in my industry, but covid fucked that all up. 

Now everything is a nightmare. I go to work every day, and check my email first thing. No new work coming in. Then I realize I have to pay all the business expenses. I check quick books to make sure we have the money before i cut checks. The account is draining fast. I panic, and it makes things worse. I pay the bills, then think about which employee I’m going to have to lay off at the end of the week. Not fun. 

My wife then texts me about how the boards on the deck are rotting, and we need to replace them. Great, $400 down the drain, and a Saturday lost. Oh, and that big oak tree in the back has some kind of fungus. It’ll be $900 to treat, but it might not work, but we can split it. Then the lot next to us gets bought, and they cut all the trees down that we’re giving us privacy. $500 in trees for the fence line. 

My main customer calls me and says we need to talk, and he’s coming by Monday at 1. I already know what it’s about. “Since oilfield is shit now, we are cutting all existing orders”. 

My wife makes good money, and I used to, but don’t anymore, so we get denied for daycare assistance. They pulled paystubs for a year instead of accounting for lost wages because of covid. We are fucked. $300 a week for both.

In the past 6 months, my AC has gone out in my car, $2700, my engine seized, under warranty, but about 60 hours of work arguing to get them to honor it lawyers involved and everything $1500. 
The new dog we got won’t stop pissing on everything, so I had to take her back to the shelter. It broke my heart. We had her about 3 months, and I worked with her every day to train her (I brought her to work every day), be she just wouldn’t get it. Jumped up on the bare mattress, and peed. $2800 mattress. 

So alllllll of these stresses, and many more have contributed to me being a pretty depressed person lately. So my wife tells me last night she wants a divorce. I didn’t even cry, I just got in the car, and drove around with a beer for a little while. I thought about going home and getting my gun, and leaving again, but then i remembered. 

What kind of life are my son and daughter going to have if they have to live with the fact that their dad shot himself? The 6 year old would be devastated, 
And the 1 year old will grow up never knowing me. That’s not fair to them. 

I am so tired of this rat race, and so tired of being unhappy. It doesn’t matter how many nice things you have, or how much money you used to have. The only thing that matters is a solid state of mind to get through life. I don’t have that.

I guess this is crying for help or support, does anyone else experience this happiness rush while thinking of suicide or just dying in general?

Just in case anybody asks, I do have friends and family but nobody really takes me seriously when I'm trying to talk about it. Most common answer is don't be stupid. It will pass. Well it's been at least 10 years since I have felt truly happy. And i tried making money, going out as well as the opposite, living with minimum effort and staying at home. The only thing I like to do is play video games. 

It's killing me when people say that they are jealous of my life, I fucking hate it. Im not afraid of changing it but there is nothing that improved it so far and I tried many things. Im thinking about suicide more and more often. To the point that the thought alone calms me and excites me.

I took care of my sibling when I was young myself. I'm quite mature for my age so don't think I can't handle emotions.

,SuicideWatch,"A friend of mine used to tweet a phrase that always sticks with me: ""Some people are lucky, some people are not."" That was some years ago, and the more I live now, the more I see (&amp; realized/learned) that it's true. Most people seriously underestimate how luck plays a BIG/HUGE factor in their lives. Or in life, for all that matters. I don't know and I'm not sure if it's due to the meritocracy thing (""If you work hard, you WILL succeed/reach success!""), or if it's due to the 'positive/optimistic' self-help culture/trend/hype that is literally almost everywhere nowadays, etc etc. But I think it's very naive, simplistic, &amp; ignorant if people seriously believe that they control ALL and EVERY aspect of their life/lives. 

Even the reddit posts that will get popular &amp; many upvotes, and other posts that get almost no vote/comment or even banned/deleted (even though when they're really good posts, but sadly just very underrated or underappreciated), it also has the 'luck' factor in it. And as a result (or even the fatal consequences), no wonder some redditors in this reddit (or subreddit) will feel even more alone, unloved, nobody cares, and some of them will probably even decide to be 'gone forever' by committing suicide. 

But back to the main point again: if you really think much more deeper, you will see that it's all random (yes, somewhat nihilistic). Some people will win, &amp; some people will lose. Some people will survive &amp; live, while some people will die. I always view our human species just like those little ants: There are billions of them on this planet, and some will get crushed &amp; die, while some other will survive &amp; live. That's basically our human life too. In fact, it's ALL lives in this universe. Some will live; Some will die. 

Lastly, it's the same thing with all of us here who are depressed &amp; suicidal. You take a look at all your other friends, family, colleagues, or people, and how they somehow are happy, or even successful, and then you think: ""Why I can't be like that too?"", even though you've tried or even work really hard. And then even when you eventually see how some of us in this reddit (or subreddit) can finally recover, cured, healed, &amp; finally lead a normal, happy, &amp; successful life too, it will make you think the same again: ""Why I can't be like them?"". 

I don't know if it's god, karma, universe, destiny, fate, or just simply pure random chances. But to say that you don't believe in luck, playing at least SOME aspects/parts in your life, that's just naive, ignorant, &amp; too simple-minded.

I ran away from home a few days ago after getting into a quarrel with my father and have been homeless in my car since then. I skipped work yesterday (no call/ no show) because my head has been so fogged I can’t think straight 

I’ve dealt with mental health issues on and off since high school when my mom passed (in my early 20’s now). I’ve been trying to get a grip on life to move out and get my own place like most people my age. But I just keep slipping up just when I think my mindset was in the right direction. 

My family insists to take my time to get my life together before moving out, but I always feel as I am taking too long. I know my dad and his wife want to move back to their hometown to live with their folks for their remaining years, but I know I’m the reason from keeping them to do so.

It all started about a year ago, my grandfather got diagnosed with a heart issue and he's been superweak since then. Back then I always had a person I would consider a lifelong friend, he would be there supporting me but situation has gone far worse for me and here is why:

- my parents have almot stopped to support me in anyway, they pulled me out of a top-tier private college here in spain without letting me know. They barely care about whats about me and it seems as if my personal success produces them hate.

-I havent seen my grandfather in a long time due to my father broken relationship with him, I know his situation has gone critical lasts weeks because I call my grandma. I cant afford loosing one of the most important person in my life right now and Im afraid because of covid I will not even be able to see him again.

- lately I've been feeling alone, I dont think its the typical teenager shit of wow im so deep,  but a real feel of loneliness, as I've told that friend "" I feel as a fucking non playable character"".

&lt;p&gt;It all started about a year ago, my grandfather got diagnosed with a heart issue and he&amp;#39;s been superweak since then. Back then I always had a person I would consider a lifelong friend, he would be there supporting me but situation has gone far worse for me and here is why:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;my parents have almot stopped to support me in anyway, they pulled me out of a top-tier private college here in spain without letting me know. They barely care about whats about me and it seems as if my personal success produces them hate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I havent seen my grandfather in a long time due to my father broken relationship with him, I know his situation has gone critical lasts weeks because I call my grandma. I cant afford loosing one of the most important person in my life right now and Im afraid because of covid I will not even be able to see him again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;lately I&amp;#39;ve been feeling alone, I dont think its the typical teenager shit of wow im so deep,  but a real feel of loneliness, as I&amp;#39;ve told that friend &amp;quot; I feel as a fucking non playable character&amp;quot;. Im just tryna get back up again and I just need that special person to talk for a while and tell him, bro I dont wanna die today please help me. Not even my family supports me.&lt;/li&gt;

I fell into depression in the winter. I began to use video games and the internet as my escape. I became depersonalized and derealized. And it has stayed this way up until now as I am lying in my bed as a senior. I’ve tried so hard, but I’m not strong enough.

Dear God, 
I really fucking tried. I thought you cared about me. Well I think it’s a lie. You care about some people, special people. And I’m not one of them.

Dear Mommy, 
Your support meant a lot. And I wanted to die last year but I didn’t want to add to the grandma and auntie Gogo of it all. It would be too much death. You did your best. 

Dear dada, 
I forgive you. You pushed me and wanted me to succeed and I get it. I just wasn’t as strong as you and I’m sorry. I know you had a rough life and you came out stronger but I just couldn’t. I really tried though. I’m sorry my best wasn’t enough. 

Dear Brieanna, 
Well you’re the oldest now, even though you’ve been that for the past few years. You’ll be better at it than me. You’re strong. In Remembrance of me, please be kind to others no matter who. 

Dear Brielle, 
You have no trouble bouncing between anger and happiness but remember to cry. I know you hated that I was so sensitive but I don’t want you to bottle it up. Don’t end up like me. 

Dear Brina, 
You’re so tough and funny I’m jealous. I was so insecure and awkward at your age, it makes me happy to know you’re better off than I was. Stay fierce. 

Dear Jeremy, 
My only baby. I treated you like you were my son and honestly I feel like you’re the most like me personality wise. Life is hard for people like us. And people won’t understand how much you feel and the depth of your emotion. Feel it anyway. 

Dear friends, 
To my online friends thank you. You encouraged me when no one else would. You were friends to me from hundreds of miles away and never made me feel alone. I survived as long as I did because of you. To those I never got to hug in person I regret that the most. 
 To my in person friends, let’s be honest here. There weren’t many of you and we hung out and talked very rarely. I always felt like something held us back. Maybe it was me, maybe I was the bad friend or off putting or weird. And for that I’m sorry, I always wanted a close friend group and try as I did to make it happen it never lasted. But that’s life for me I think. Some things just aren’t meant to be.

Dear Charlie, 
I know you can’t read, although who knows, it would be very much like you to know how and just play dumb. I love you so much, and honestly maybe I died so I wouldn’t live without you in my life, you were the best boy and you helped me on those bad days and nights. You knew. Be a good boy for those I left behind. 


Dear people who didn’t like me, 

(I’m assuming there’s a lot) I thought about you quite often, the ones I knew and the ones I suspected and those I had no idea about. Odds are you really don’t care one way or another about me but for those who loathed me I guess today is a happy day for you. To my arch nemesis, I’ll see you in Hell. Jk who knows 


Dear John, 
I hope I made you laugh with that last one. Honestly i think you were my only true friend in the world. I told you everything and anything and you accepted me. The love you showed me on my worst day and my best day was the same. Infinite. I know you held back from me and honestly it’s probably because you suspected this day would come. I want you to know if anyone could have stopped me, and you succeeded on multiple occasions, it would have been you. And maybe if we lived together you could have but I guess it wasn’t in the cards. I’m sorry we never got married, I’m sorry we never got to see Paris, I’m sorry we never opened a restaurant, and I’m sorry we never got to take Charlie to the beach. We had so many plans and in over 5 years of dating we probably accomplished 2. Life has been hard and I know this makes it even worse for you. But know I couldn’t take it anymore. The purgatory of waiting of the unknown. The endless someday soon. I was barely holding on as it was. I could tell you to move on, live our dreams for us but honestly you probably won’t. And that’s okay. As long as you do something. And hey how great am I, no matter how happy you get you’ll always have a tragic past to use for your stand up comedy. Life was never going to get better for me but it can for you. Stop being so damn scared of living, and leave your room. Do it for me. 

I’m sorry for your loss everyone. I truly am.

My wife and I are splitting up. Its because of years of me choosing weed over my family like my sons birthday, my anniversary, all of it... It's all my fault. The women that I spent 5 years of my life married too, had a wonderful unbelievably amazing daughter and son with.. Idk how to do this.

I'm madly in love with this woman but.. somehow it wasn't enough to overcome my own selfishness. I've ruined the only thing I've ever wanted, a real family. I don't know where I'm suppose to go.. how do I drive now that I'm leaving her with the car, the bills, the kids, my heart, fuck... everything is with this woman. I couldn't stand to see her happy with someone else, but I do wish her nothing but happiness. I just.. she's been kissing me and I was just told its because I want it. She doesn't even want to kiss me. I really fucked up. I don't know where to go from here. I don't know if I want more than what I've already taken in this life. I've struggled with chronic depression and suicidal thoughts my entire life, and right when I think that I'm finally over it.. this happens. I am the bad guy here. I know I am and no matter how many tears I cry it'll never fix what I once had.

If I'm not going to kill myself, then I need to know how to do this. She works 40 hours during the week on days, and I work 2 12's on saturday and sunday so money isn't exactly easy to come by. What about my babies.. how does the mother of my children sustain their living situation and her own without me around to watch them while she works. I'm sure she'll find a way.

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a good relationship with my parents &amp;amp; im just really scared atp. I feel hopeless , &amp;amp; it feels bottomless &amp;amp; im so exhausted. I’m so tired . My brain doesn’t allow me to do anything outside of my thoughts. I don’t even know who I am or who I’m supposed to pretend to be anymore. I want to break free of it but I can’t . I’m so tired .&lt;/p&gt;
