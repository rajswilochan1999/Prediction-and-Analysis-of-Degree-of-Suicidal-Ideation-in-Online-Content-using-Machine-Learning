###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,1,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2323,23,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2323,,True,,False,,[],{'gid_2': 1},,True,,1572389522.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

They’re my best friends and had a joint party for the both of them because thats how they roll. It was held in their friends house because their apartment is too small. The apartment was extended nice and I just kind of got jealous. That was the start.

Eventually the party led into games about the bride and groom, and then led into a toast. The toast about the bride and groom just really dug into me.

And to clarify, I am using techniques that are supposed to help. Telling myself things like I’m incredibly lucky to be here, I’m glad to have friends. I see this house as a goal for my future. 

But all I keep seeing are things I won’t have. I don’t forsee myself getting married, and if I do, who would come anyway? Who would want to be part anything concerned with me?

But I can't even leave this ""home away from home"", because the *palpable* ignorance of otherwise (presumably) innocent people makes me feel like a ticking bomb.

,depression,"Sorry, I woke up about 3 hours ago with this on my mind and I can't seem to let it go. 

I've had depression for a long time but only been formally diagnosed with it and GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder) for about 3 years. Don't get me wrong, it has been useful in the past to have an outside perspective, especially when I'm too depressed to notice my depression. However, I really wish people would use some critical thinking when trying to tell me the obvious or give me some unsolicited advice.

""Your depression is getting worse"" oh? I just thought having a sudden need to sleep for 16 hours a day and drinking several cups of coffee outside of that just to feel normal was something everyone went through.

""Did you know your diet can affect your mood?"". Yes. I get that, however, please understand I'm part of a heavily covid hit sector and as a result even paying rent has been hard. I really don't have the money to spend on whatever fancy quinoa mix you're trying to give me right now. Sometimes bread, potato and some apples a family member picked from their garden tree as a gift is the only thing I can eat this week. 

""Well! *offended noises* I'm just trying to help! Arn't I allowed to do that at least?"" Oh hey mom, nice to see you still can't handle someone not following your every word like gospel. I get that you are trying to do some good but you've refused to listen to me the last ten times we've had this conversation. Also, please stop using this line, it's a classic guilt trip and makes me genuinely want to have not so kind words with you.

""Maybe medication will help?"" I have had some success, but the side effects have all impacted my anxiety so bad that either a doctor has either taken me off them or in one case I took myself off them. (I cannot stress how bad an idea going cold turkey is holy shit DO NOT do that). Right now, me and my doctor have decided to take a break and have moved me to just Cognative Behavioural Therapy for now. 

""You are just lazy"" or ""You are not depressed, I have depression and it's nothing like what I go through."" Oh look, its mom again. I see the ""woe is me"" card is still a favourite of yours. Look, depression is not the same in everyone, it's a mixed bag of cognative, behavioural and physical symptoms. Just because your model of depression is insomnia inducing, it doesn't mean my constant fatigue is me being lazy. 

""Oh my god, I'm so depressed."" Maybe you are. But quick reminder depression is not just another word for sadness. Please stop using it for sympathy points either in real life or on the Internet because depression fucking destroys lives. I can still feel sympathy towards you if you're having a bad day. I feel less sympathy when you act like it's a fashion accessory to show off.

""Depression isn't real/ a liberal hoax"" Yeah, I guess the Anxiety attack I had in the doctors office the first time I tried to explain to my doctor some of my experiences was a totally normal reaction. Or maybe the fact that I once spent 4 months in bed, only leaving my flat to buy food at night was extremley normal behaviour too? If denial is your poison of choice, whatever. Just let me get the medical help I need so I don't turn into another statistic you'll say is fake.

Sorry for the rant, I know no one asked but sometimes ranting into the void helps get my mind clear for a while. I hope it gets better for those reading this.

,depression,"I felt quite OK the last month. I mean, obviously I was still depressed (because depression doesn't go away so easily), lonely and ugly af, but at least I went out and I took a bit of care of myself. But the last 10 days, they were terrible and it seems I am not able to snap out of this situation. I feel like shit 24/7, I constantly have suicidal thoughts, I haven't left home in 10 days, I don't take care of myself, I spend all day in bed and I get up only to eat, I don't even take showers.I feel completely dead inside. I am not bipolar, I was diagnosed with severe depression, generalized anxiety and bulimia nervosa. The ""fun"" fact is that I have stopped puking after eating, but it doesn't make me feel better at all, because I overeat and I am getting fatter and fatter. I don't have self esteem and this is making things worse. I am lonely, I have no close friends or a partner, I live with my parents but they work all day long. I don't work because of my mental health problems which basically make uncomfortable in leaving house for a long time and have contacts with strangers. I feel unloved, unwanted, unlovable. After all I am too ugly to be loved and that's why I have never had someone who really loved me. I am 22yo but my body looks like I am 70 due to jumping from an eating disorder to another.

But the last 10 days, they were terrible and it seems I am not able to snap out of this situation.

I am not bipolar, I was diagnosed with severe depression, generalized anxiety and bulimia nervosa. The &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; fact is that I have stopped puking after eating, but it doesn&amp;#39;t make me feel better at all, because I overeat and I am getting fatter and fatter. I don&amp;#39;t have self esteem and this is making things worse. I am lonely, I have no close friends or a partner, I live with my parents but they work all day long. I don&amp;#39;t work because of my mental health problems which basically make uncomfortable in leaving house for a long time and have contacts with strangers. I feel unloved, unwanted, unlovable. After all I am too ugly to be loved and that&amp;#39;s why I have never had someone who really loved me. I am 22yo but my body looks like I am 70 due to jumping from an eating disorder to another.

I sit through hours upon hours of online lectures just staring at the screen not retaining a word that is being thought and looking at the clock saying 7 hours have gone by. I feel like I am disconnecting from my mind, simple tasks and assignments take me hours to do and no matter how hard I study I retain nothing. Added to that I hate my body so much, I’ve removed every single mirrored object from my room so that I do not have to look at myself. All I see is a big slob with cankles, a big nose and short frizzy hair. Yes I fake the “happiness” everyday for the sake of my parents as my home life is pretty okay. However, I despise waking up everyday, reliving the same routine everyday and seeing the same people everyday. I’ve cut off so many friendships I’ve lost count so I literally have 5 or so at the moment. Recently I’ve tried other coping mechanisms such as “trying to sex my sadness away” but that doesn’t even help and if anything it just makes it worse. I have an exam tomorrow and I just cannot be bothered, my mother says I’m lazy but I just don’t see the point of studying as it will make no difference. At this point I’m contemplating just dropping out of uni all together and not going back. I just cannot stand logging on everyday and seeing all their faces so happy and so enthusiastic, it just kills me inside.

Sometimes my parents are talking to me and I have no recollection of the words they are saying until I snap back into reality. I sit through hours upon hours of online lectures just staring at the screen not retaining a word that is being thought and looking at the clock saying 7 hours have gone by. I feel like I am disconnecting from my mind, simple tasks and assignments take me hours to do and no matter how hard I study I retain nothing. Added to that I hate my body so much, I’ve removed every single mirrored object from my room so that I do not have to look at myself. All I see is a big slob with cankles, a big nose and short frizzy hair. Yes I fake the “happiness” everyday for the sake of my parents as my home life is pretty okay. However, I despise waking up everyday, reliving the same routine everyday and seeing the same people everyday. I’ve cut off so many friendships I’ve lost count so I literally have 5 or so at the moment. Recently I’ve tried other coping mechanisms such as “trying to sex my sadness away” but that doesn’t even help and if anything it just makes it worse. I have an exam tomorrow and I just cannot be bothered, my mother says I’m lazy but I just don’t see the point of studying as it will make no difference. At this point I’m contemplating just dropping out of uni all together and not going back. I just cannot stand logging on everyday and seeing all their faces so happy and so enthusiastic, it just kills me inside.

,depression,"This happened about two weeks ago.

I only got hospitalised for two days. In those two days everyone just got mad at me.

“There are people who have it worse than you”
“You’re just looking for attention, aren’t you”
“Really? In the middle of a fucking pandemic?”
“You know that’s a terrible sin against God”
“What the hell is wrong with you?”

From the people in the hospital to my aunts and uncles and to my mother they just got mad at me. I have never felt so alone and helpless in my life. Even worse, when my mom told my dad that I just overdosed before bringing me to the hospital, he literally didn’t care and just went to sleep. When I got discharged he just continued to treat me like shit.

It was midnight when I took the pills. I pussied out as always and only took like a small amount. I didn’t feel anything after I took them, so I just went to sleep. The next day my head felt like it was gonna explode. It was the most painful headache I’ve experienced in my life, and my body was really hot. My mom kept nagging me to eat breakfast so I finally told her that I attempted to overdose myself. On the trip from home to the hospital, my mom, aunt and uncle (who were there to drive me to the hospital) just berated me on the entire trip. I was crying the whole time. 

There were so many people that talked to me at the hospital. All of them just said the same shitty things. I wanted to cry so bad but my eyes were dried out of tears. Then they said shit like “Just meditate and everything would be okay” “Just pray to God”. After the entire thing, it was as if nothing happened.

I just feel so terrible and helpless. Thinking about it now, maybe they are right. I really am just an ungrateful idiot. 

Right now everything has gone back to normal. Still doing my schoolwork. Nobody really knows what happened to me, only my parents, aunts and uncles. 

Now I really regret it. Maybe I shouldn’t have done that. Maybe I should have taken more. I really just feel so alone. My classmates don’t know and they think I just got a bit sick because of my brief disappearance. It really puts into perspective that I’m nothing more than a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things.

&lt;p&gt;I only got hospitalised for two days. In those two days everyone just got mad at me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are people who have it worse than you”
“You’re just looking for attention, aren’t you”
“Really? In the middle of a fucking pandemic?”
“You know that’s a terrible sin against God”
“What the hell is wrong with you?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the people in the hospital to my aunts and uncles and to my mother they just got mad at me. I have never felt so alone and helpless in my life. Even worse, when my mom told my dad that I just overdosed before bringing me to the hospital, he literally didn’t care and just went to sleep. When I got discharged he just continued to treat me like shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was midnight when I took the pills. I pussied out as always and only took like a small amount. I didn’t feel anything after I took them, so I just went to sleep. The next day my head felt like it was gonna explode. It was the most painful headache I’ve experienced in my life, and my body was really hot. My mom kept nagging me to eat breakfast so I finally told her that I attempted to overdose myself. On the trip from home to the hospital, my mom, aunt and uncle (who were there to drive me to the hospital) just berated me on the entire trip. I was crying the whole time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were so many people that talked to me at the hospital. All of them just said the same shitty things. I wanted to cry so bad but my eyes were dried out of tears. Then they said shit like “Just meditate and everything would be okay” “Just pray to God”. After the entire thing, it was as if nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just feel so terrible and helpless. Thinking about it now, maybe they are right. I really am just an ungrateful idiot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now everything has gone back to normal. Still doing my schoolwork. Nobody really knows what happened to me, only my parents, aunts and uncles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I really regret it. Maybe I shouldn’t have done that. Maybe I should have taken more. I really just feel so alone. My classmates don’t know and they think I just got a bit sick because of my brief disappearance. It really puts into perspective that I’m nothing more than a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really know where I’m going with this. So sorry it’s incomprehensible and stupidly long. I just need to finally tell someone about my experience. That’s all&lt;/p&gt;

From about half way through high school my acne worsened, i had a friend group and I still do but I never fully considered them friends. Its hard to explain but people don't look at you the same, you feel the same as everyone else but I could tell I didn't fit in. No matter who i was with i would always feel alone, i would also struggle with conversation as I would always be in my head. I wouldn't finish or want to finish what I was saying because I would feel as if people didn't want to hear me talk. I hated school towards the end, I didn't attend graduation, formal, or any school events. After school finished \[about a year ago now\] i got into drugs, not hard drugs just marijuana, lsd, and occasionally dmt. I just needed an escape i guess. besides the point i feel as if the drugs helped, I don't live near town and just live with my father who is old now. I never have someone to talk to, so when my father would go to sleep i would just get high and talk to myself. recently i started going to gym again and have had some crazy progress, i have an excellent understanding of nutrition and bodybuilding, its my passion, i am well above average build and people would compliment me on photos but it would make no difference. Acne is just a deal breaker, nobody will ever get close enough to me or ever see past the skin, its just how humans are. Also to everyone that will give advice like go talk to friends and do things that make you happy, that's the thing, acne just doesn't work that way. All I want to do is hide, all my mind can think about is how i need to stay home, hide, and fix myself before I can go out and socialise and be normal again. But i have no clue how long that will be, its not getting better and I don't know when it will. \[I am on a non dairy diet and using proper acne medication btw\] Anyway point being I feel as if all I'm doing is wasting time hiding trying to fix myself, but now I'm even more depressed because I'm wasting my life. every time I go out or try to socialise I just remind myself of how I need to be fixed. 2 of my good friends have committed suicide and I know for a fact I'm next, I just cant do it right now, I couldn't do that to my dad, it would destroy him, a father should never have to burry his son. My life currently is just a mess and I wish I could end it all with no repercussions, I currently have 2 options. wait until my life is fixed and there is a turnaround, or wait until my father passes away so he wont have to deal with my death. It sounds depressing and dark I know, but it is what it is, some people are just different I guess. I don't feel sad about ending my life, and I am not depressed about the fact that I will be gone soon enough, I'm just depressed because I'm trapped in a life I don't want to live, but I cant escape without hurting the ones I love most.

,depression,"So, for the past couple months I’ve been slowly pruning my social media... I’m only on Reddit now, obviously, and Facebook for a political activism group I am debating leaving since I’m barely active in there anyway. (Probably due to my depression and abstaining from mainstream politics as I feel like the odd man out hating this election like last election...)

I digress, the point of this post is a detailed description of my pain and sorrow. An unfettered look into my psyche with as much articulative knowledge from the English language as I can muster up. I want to be fully forward... I never have been and no one ever listened...even if no one cares.

For the longest time, I’ve gone through multiple layers of hell. Each one more arduous than the last so much so I feel as though I’ll break eventually but they all center one or two aspects of the human condition:

Love/Loneliness and sociality

My hell is also self-perpetuated but fueled off of every negative event I’ve gone through. Seeking negativity was a sickness because I was extremely accustomed to it. It was the only way anyone acknowledged me as a child, a teenager, and now a man if you can even call me one...

Growing up, I was surrounded by very devout and aggressive southern baptists. Violence was always the answer and I was the odd man out as a pacifist. My mother was never really there. She’d work two jobs...sometimes three, to make ends meet while being married to my step-father.

I never knew my father besides one time where I spent a night at his motel with his new wife and daughters...awkwardly. And another when my grandfather called him to invite him down while my parents were visiting him. They fought like hell and I watched them fight while my mom talked to her cousin like nothing happened.

I was taught to respect my step-father because he was “there” and “paid his way”...when he was only there to beat me sometimes amor find the littlest imperfection I exuded. Oh, and he still works at the same job while my mom became a doctor.

I never really told my mom until recently and just as the time when I was a six year old I knew she’d blame it on me and my “jealousy” trying to ruin her marriage. She justified his abuse saying he grew up with a terrible drunk father.

I guess, subconsciously, I acted out and pissed him off because at least when he calmed down he said he loved me more.

School was usually the same way. I acted out and talked because then people would actually notice my existence. I was an “attention whore”... even when bullies hated me it felt good to not be ignored.

Then middle school came and high school where I let boys who didn’t know if they were gay touch and molest me if they wanted...it bothered me to be used by those who thought my existence was an abomination but I felt good in a sick way being used.

Then undergraduate college came: long story short I was ostracized from a “friend” group that I was active in and helpful in. Accused of sexual harassment, given death threats, shunned my fellow classmates, manipulated by multiple men I dated, raped and used by someone I trusted, and blocked out of everyone’s lives on social media.

Everywhere I went. I was despised and hated. No matter how hard I tried to be a positive person, to care and love for people, I was used like a cumrag and thrown away. I exude darkness.

So, I snapped. I became a hardcore nihilist and tried to kill myself multiple times to which my mother retorted “I bet you were praying to Jesus then, huh?”

As loving as she can be she can be very vindictive and precise with her words...so much so it feels like the person you love stabbed you with a knife in your throat wondering if it was all worth it to struggle against the precipice of death.

One thing is for certain...only adrenaline and cortisol kept me alive. That was all.

Today, I’m alive. I’m not okay but I’m alive and I guess that’s something.

Despite this hell on earth I want to do great things for humanity and I hope to achieve it. I will at least try.

I’ve talked to many therapists and tried many psychotropic medications for several years to no avail and to little to no success.

I hate I know the blueprint of what to do to but the architecture of my brain has grown a cage around that awareness and clairvoyance like the developmental neuroplasticity of my brain from the BEGINNING is hard wired for misery. 

It’s akin to knowing and being aware of all that is wrong and you wish you could make people see but you can’t and they never will see.

So, I’ll probably just go back to the gay dating apps...and mindlessly peruse them thinking I have any chance. Then delete them when I can’t take it anymore. Then redownload them and look for approval and worth with sex. Ad infinitum ad mortem...

Not sure if I’ll ever get better or improve sufficiently enough for myself. How could I when I’m so broken from others and myself? Is my individuality an error?

Why am I everything abominable to everyone: a gay, black, fat, weird, ugly, disgusting person...

Why is it so hard? Why can’t I just be loved for fucking once? Why is it bad to be needy? Why is it bad to want to be loved? I would give my all to someone and more.

I am a being of love who never has it requited and never will. I feel meant for it and I starve and die slowly without it. It is a basic need just like a bird needs to fly but even they get caged...and when you are caged, psyche and all, you stop trying to fly...and maybe the wings are useless and maybe they should be pruned...",t2_43evusvw,False,,0,False,Yay life I guess...(Description of my personal hell),[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_jhoy6p,False,dark,0.81,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603636848.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, for the past couple months I’ve been slowly pruning my social media... I’m only on Reddit now, obviously, and Facebook for a political activism group I am debating leaving since I’m barely active in there anyway. (Probably due to my depression and abstaining from mainstream politics as I feel like the odd man out hating this election like last election...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I digress, the point of this post is a detailed description of my pain and sorrow. An unfettered look into my psyche with as much articulative knowledge from the English language as I can muster up. I want to be fully forward... I never have been and no one ever listened...even if no one cares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, I’ve gone through multiple layers of hell. Each one more arduous than the last so much so I feel as though I’ll break eventually but they all center one or two aspects of the human condition:&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"So I’m a 22 year old female and I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD which was misdiagnosed as just anxiety and depression for a long time. I deal with both of those things, but the cause of them is my ADHD. Along with this, I am also dealing with PTSD. 

Backstory:
I’ve been at my job as a teacher’s assistant while I’m in college for a year and a half. Last week, my supervisor pulled me into a meeting to discuss how my attendance has been a problem. It was a 3 to 1 dynamic where I was being told by 3 people who do not work directly with me, that everything I’m doing is wrong with no warning. I have used 5 sick days since school started, which I’ll admit were really because my mental health has been so bad. I also ended up getting COVID and using part of my additional covid days we have been allowed this year. I haven’t used all my allotted sick days or even close to half of them. I’ve also always found a substitute. I also got in trouble for missing a training session that happened while I had COVID and they asked me to miss my graduate school classes to reschedule and I said no. Then they ended up scheduling it when I have therapy next week even after I asked them not to. I basically was told in this meeting that everything I’m doing is wrong. What it boils down to is them not communicating expectations to me, expecting me to do things outside of my job description and comfort zone (and humiliating me when I expressed discomfort), and also reprimanding me for doing work on a computer that the teacher I work directly with asked me to do.. which they didn’t know because they didn’t bother to ask either of us and had assumed I was just wasting time on social media while at work. There’s more to the story, and a lot more examples of my supervisors acting unprofessionally in this meeting and times before, but I’ll leave it at that. 

I’ve already been struggling very hard to keep my head above water. I’ve had ongoing suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, and depressive episodes where I can’t shower, eat, or take care of myself this whole year. The thought of going back to that place on Monday is  keeping me up at night and inciting more nightmares than I already have from the PTSD. I’m also in graduate school, and because of the stress and anxiety my job gives me, my grades have been suffering. 

I need to leave. I also need help. 

My therapist is amazing and I love her and I’ve made a lot of progress. But shit keeps hitting the fan and I think I need some more aggressive treatment and also a “break” where I can focus on me and learn better coping skills. I think I want to voluntarily check into a mental health facility. There is a really good program near where I live. My parents have agreed to help me financially.

My problem: 
I don’t know how to quit. I don’t know what to tell my teacher, my principle, or my student. I am so scared. But I can’t work there anymore. Taking a leave of absence isn’t an option for support staff. I don’t know what to say. I don’t even want to go in there again. Half of me just wants to send an email and never go back, but I left some stuff there and I do want to say bye to my student and the teacher I work with.

I’m worried because they won’t have a substitute to take my place Monday. But when I tell you I can’t work another day there, I’m serious that I can’t. On Thursday, one of my loved ones passed away and I was so scared to ask to leave that I just kept going to the bathroom and crying until I worked up the guts to ask off Friday. And one of my supervisors still made me feel bad for it because of the “circumstances” of my absences already.

I would like to add that this job is not necessary to my career growth. It’s not part of my path, the pay is not that good, and it may come in the way of my graduate school practicum next year anyway. So I was going to have to leave within the next year.. I just can’t make it that long. 

TL;DR: I suffer from ADHD and PTSD and I’m suicidal and depressed. My job has made things worse and treated me unfairly, and I need to quit so I can try to go to a mental health facility and focus on myself and school after that, but I don’t know how to quit.",t2_q7v3k,False,,0,False,I want to quit my job without notice and go to a mental health facility,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_jhpowx,False,dark,0.8,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603641157.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I’m a 22 year old female and I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD which was misdiagnosed as just anxiety and depression for a long time. I deal with both of those things, but the cause of them is my ADHD. Along with this, I am also dealing with PTSD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backstory:
I’ve been at my job as a teacher’s assistant while I’m in college for a year and a half. Last week, my supervisor pulled me into a meeting to discuss how my attendance has been a problem. It was a 3 to 1 dynamic where I was being told by 3 people who do not work directly with me, that everything I’m doing is wrong with no warning. I have used 5 sick days since school started, which I’ll admit were really because my mental health has been so bad. I also ended up getting COVID and using part of my additional covid days we have been allowed this year. I haven’t used all my allotted sick days or even close to half of them. I’ve also always found a substitute. I also got in trouble for missing a training session that happened while I had COVID and they asked me to miss my graduate school classes to reschedule and I said no. Then they ended up scheduling it when I have therapy next week even after I asked them not to. I basically was told in this meeting that everything I’m doing is wrong. What it boils down to is them not communicating expectations to me, expecting me to do things outside of my job description and comfort zone (and humiliating me when I expressed discomfort), and also reprimanding me for doing work on a computer that the teacher I work directly with asked me to do.. which they didn’t know because they didn’t bother to ask either of us and had assumed I was just wasting time on social media while at work. There’s more to the story, and a lot more examples of my supervisors acting unprofessionally in this meeting and times before, but I’ll leave it at that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve already been struggling very hard to keep my head above water. I’ve had ongoing suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, and depressive episodes where I can’t shower, eat, or take care of myself this whole year. The thought of going back to that place on Monday is  keeping me up at night and inciting more nightmares than I already have from the PTSD. I’m also in graduate school, and because of the stress and anxiety my job gives me, my grades have been suffering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to leave. I also need help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My therapist is amazing and I love her and I’ve made a lot of progress. But shit keeps hitting the fan and I think I need some more aggressive treatment and also a “break” where I can focus on me and learn better coping skills. I think I want to voluntarily check into a mental health facility. There is a really good program near where I live. My parents have agreed to help me financially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem: 
I don’t know how to quit. I don’t know what to tell my teacher, my principle, or my student. I am so scared. But I can’t work there anymore. Taking a leave of absence isn’t an option for support staff. I don’t know what to say. I don’t even want to go in there again. Half of me just wants to send an email and never go back, but I left some stuff there and I do want to say bye to my student and the teacher I work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m worried because they won’t have a substitute to take my place Monday. But when I tell you I can’t work another day there, I’m serious that I can’t. On Thursday, one of my loved ones passed away and I was so scared to ask to leave that I just kept going to the bathroom and crying until I worked up the guts to ask off Friday. And one of my supervisors still made me feel bad for it because of the “circumstances” of my absences already.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I reached my breaking point last night. I've been having a long bout of depression that's been slowly getting worse over time.

Moved to another country. I don't speak the language here, I have yet to meet any close friends in the 2 years I've been here. I haven't been able to work, since I had a small baby and they don't allow your child to go to daycare here until they're over a year old. So, I was on ""maternity"" time. I had been planning all these things I wanted to do when my child was old enough to go to daycare. And I was really looking forward to it...

And then Covid happened. We were worried about sending our child to daycare, but did anyway. She didn't get covid, but sick with a couple other illnesses, that she brought back every couple of weeks... So, we decided just to isolate from our older family members...

And then I found out I was pregnant again. Which came with a flood of emotions, and knowing: 1) no one is going to hire me if I have to go on maternity leave in less than a year, and 2) That means, I'm going to have to wait another 2 years... I tried to really stay on the bright side. I thought, maybe it's a good thing, since I only want two kids? Then I'll be able to work without any interruptions. I'm also not a spring chicken, I'm already in my 30s, so maybe it's better not to wait? Because setting up a career takes time and I wouldn't want to have another kid during that time. I may end up too old.

But of course being pregnant in the first trimester has had its challenges. Not only have I been dealing with my bout of depression, making me tired, I also have pregnancy exhaustion. I'm tired all the time. I have trouble sleeping. Last week was hell. I got food poisoning, was worried it would harm the baby, everything ended up being fine. But right after it was gone, I developed a migraine for 3 days. I couldn't take my migraine meds, because I'm pregnant. Tylenol didn't help. Ice didn't help. Caffeine sorta helped. But it sucked.

Now it's the weekend. Last night I couldn't sleep. I was actually up late listening to upbeat dance music. Went to lay down for sleep, I didn't want to have sex. Then my partner says, ""I can't let your depression control my life."" 

I just broke down. I started to cry and cry. All I could think was that I have become such a burden to my own family, why am I even here in this country? I don't have anywhere to go, or anyone to talk to. I don't have any friends here. I don't have anyone to talk to and when I do talk to people, they unexpectedly, say shit like this to me... I feel like my emotions aren't safe with other people.

I haven't reached this point in over 9 years. I thought, I was over this. I thought I was happy the last five years, but was I just being delusional? Was I a fool to think somebody like me could ever lead a normal life? Because I feel like the biggest idiot is me. It was different when my depression only affected me.

,depression,"I've been depressed for the past 4 years (but could've been longer, I just realized it 4 years ago). So I have this problem that I feel bad and alone most of the time, I feel sad and sometimes I have suicidal thoughts. The thing is, there were at least two people who reached out to me, but I refused their help because I thought it was stupid. One of them was telling me to believe in God and he will help me. Now I liked this person, you could say she was my crush. But in my opinion, believing in God is pointless, it just makes you sleep better but it's no different than deluding yourself. So she made at least 3-4 attempts to kind of help me, asking me if I want to talk but I refused. Why? Because I figured she will tell me the same things she did when we were messaging online, like ''believe in God'' and all that stupid religious stuff. I also couldn't really tell her that I don't believe in God anymore, as I wasn't sure how would she take it. Well it doesn't matter now, our last online exchange was when she linked me some Christian orchestra and I just replied with a lol. Well there's that for this person. The next person was my friend. He recently got really deep into self-improvement and all that bullshit, but I tried to be polite about it. He is also religious but not as much as my crush. To keep it short, he was always telling me that ''God has shown him the way'' and then his life turned around. I was like... yeah good for you, but in my heart I just sighed. I was just disappointed that even him was deluded like that. Of course I was told stuff like, open yourself up, meet new people, get a hobby. But I can't help myself, those things are such a waste of time. I don't really care to meet new people or get a hobby. These things are just a way to pass the time, I can do the same by just wasting my life at computer. I think my post got a bit sidetracked, but what you gonna do.

The thing is, there were at least two people who reached out to me, but I refused their help because I thought it was stupid. One of them was telling me to believe in God and he will help me. Now I liked this person, you could say she was my crush. But in my opinion, believing in God is pointless, it just makes you sleep better but it&amp;#39;s no different than deluding yourself. So she made at least 3-4 attempts to kind of help me, asking me if I want to talk but I refused. Why? Because I figured she will tell me the same things she did when we were messaging online, like &amp;#39;&amp;#39;believe in God&amp;#39;&amp;#39; and all that stupid religious stuff. I also couldn&amp;#39;t really tell her that I don&amp;#39;t believe in God anymore, as I wasn&amp;#39;t sure how would she take it. Well it doesn&amp;#39;t matter now, our last online exchange was when she linked me some Christian orchestra and I just replied with a lol. Well there&amp;#39;s that for this person. The next person was my friend. He recently got really deep into self-improvement and all that bullshit, but I tried to be polite about it. He is also religious but not as much as my crush. To keep it short, he was always telling me that &amp;#39;&amp;#39;God has shown him the way&amp;#39;&amp;#39; and then his life turned around. I was like... yeah good for you, but in my heart I just sighed. I was just disappointed that even him was deluded like that. Of course I was told stuff like, open yourself up, meet new people, get a hobby. But I can&amp;#39;t help myself, those things are such a waste of time. I don&amp;#39;t really care to meet new people or get a hobby. These things are just a way to pass the time, I can do the same by just wasting my life at computer. I think my post got a bit sidetracked, but what you gonna do. Anyone else feel bad, know what to do in order to fix it, but refuse because at the end, it&amp;#39;s pointless anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"OK, first off, I am not a doctor. I'm just a guy who has been dealing with his own depression for the last 40+ years (20+ years treated for it).  Please seek medical help when you are willing and able to do something serious about treating this issue.  For just the technique, jump directly down to ""**The technique..."".**

Full disclosure: I've posted this before, but I described it with the term ""Intrusive Thoughts"".  In fact, it's actually called RUMINATION ([article](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24444431)), andI wanted to repost here using the correct term in case someone is searching reddit for answers.  Plus, I'm editing the original post with some further observations and technique tweaks.

One of my most persistent symptoms is the host of ruminations I get. Specifically, the ones where your brain makes you think about painful or embarrassing things that happened in your past. It's like you can't help but have to sit there and relive it over and over again. It's been the toughest thing for me to get rid of because they are persistent (and, I finally realized, I've been training myself to ruminate for decades).

Anyway, I finally realized that I needed to break the cycle, and...to make a long story short...I have made a technique that actually seems to work. I've been using it for over a year now, and for this particular symptom, it seems to work pretty well.

**The technique...**

First off, the tough parts. You have to be **willing** to stop the cycle...you can get addicted to it without realizing it. Then, you have to start **realizing** that you are doing it, and try to realize it *as close to the moment that you start doing it*. I'm not kidding when I say that this is the toughest part, mostly because it means diverting your behavior into something that is new to you (which is never easy). If you can do this, you really are halfway there.

Next, you tell yourself that you don't have to live *in that moment*, but instead have to **live in the NOW**. Nobody can change the past, so you don't need to worry about it anymore. The thing that you keep ruminating on...well, even if it was public, nobody (NOBODY!) else remembers it.  ABSOLUTELY NOBODDY is keeping score except you, and you don't have *any* reason to continue doing it. This should be a little bit jarring, like it's shaking you awake, but *embrace the startling aspect of it*.  Realizing you are actually free from the responsibility of punishing yourself repeatedly is *supposed* to have a little emotional charge to it.  I think of it like a debt I incurred way back when it happened, and I then realize that not only was it a tiny debt to begin with, it was paid off a loooong time ago, but I'm continuing to make payments on it.  You wouldn't do that with your car payments, would you?  No, you wouldn't.  And this is more like buying a toaster on credit for $25, making payments for 20 years on it, and end up paying $30,000 over that time.  STOP MAKING THOSE PAYMENTS!  Get a little mad about it, and you'll build some momentum for doing something to stop it.

Finally, in this moment...distract yourself. Look for anything else to think about besides the intrusive thought that you were thinking about originally. This will keep you from immediately sliding back into the old pattern. I have found that, for me, thinking of a bunch of shallow topics in succession will do the trick. ""That's a pretty tree. Hey, I'm coming up on Main Street. That car has Florida plates. My feet are very warm right now. There's a grade school. I wonder what their mascot is."" ...You get the idea. Keep it up for a full minute if you can.

That's it, that's all there is to it. It took longer to explain it than it typically takes to do it (once you get good at realizing when it happens).

Maybe this has been done before, and the technique has already been invented. I honestly don't know, nor is it particularly important to me.

,depression,"Last year I was depressed for about 8 months because i chased a girl that i wanted to be with all that time and she never gave me a clear no. I asked her out a total of 5 times only to get my confidence crushed, i was blind of obsession because i already invested so much time into my relationship with her so i kept getting my hopes up.

Here's what I've been going through and any advice is very welcome. I'm 17 and last year(Feb 2019) I attempted suicide after dealing with depression for 4 years. I was on medication, I had the support of my friends and family, etc. After the suicide attempt and an involuntary hospitalisation that lasted for 33 days I kinda got back to living my life, sorted out stuff that I needed to(a bunch of exams and stuff in school) and just..continued living. In June of 2019 I stopped taking medication and stopped visiting my psychiatrist completely. Honestly I fell back in love with life and managed to get myself out of that black hole. I made new friends, focused on my studies, this summer I even got my first summer job, I met my current boyfriend and recently I even lost my virginity. But I've been feeling worse and worse each passing day. I caught a cold, missed 4 weeks in school, and I haven't been able to focus on anything. I feel completely lost, scared that my mental health is getting worse, I've talked to some friends and family and everyone tells me I shouldn't stress about school that much but the thing is I just can't NOT stress because I'm terrified of failing yet I seriously just can't study. I have no trust in psychiatrists anymore so I don't want to seek professional help even though I suppose I should since I'm getting worse. I'm just so lost and confused and I feel so stuck.

,depression,"My boyfriend suffers from pretty bad depression. It’s something he’s struggled with his whole life. While I have gone through depression myself, and still struggle at times.. but nothing like he deals with. He’s opened up to me about how he feel more and more, and it’s pretty dark stuff. He feels like his brain never shuts off, and just constantly spirals out of control. He has very dark thoughts, hates humanity and the society we have no choice to be apart of. He constantly feels like everything is too much to handle, like his life is just one bad things after another.. to the point where he just expects the absolute worst all the time so he’s slightly less disappointed when everything goes wrong, as he knows it will. He has abused drugs, and sometimes still does.. mostly speed, because he says it’s the only time he can get quiet in his head because of the sleep deprivation. 

This has been going on since he was a kid. He told his mom when he was younger that he had bad thoughts in his head that scared him, loosely hinting at suicidal thoughts without actually saying it to her, and she kind of just got mad at him.. in my opinion it scared her, and that’s just how she reacted unwilling.. she has a very different personality than he does, she’s a very strong independent individual (she’s an Aries like I am, so I get it in a way) She always just made the best of bad situations, I was always the same. I never let myself stress or worry about stuff I had no control over, I didn’t see the point.. it just causes you mental harm, when there’s nothing you can do to change it anyway. Even in my worst periods of depression, I was still able to try and see the light at the end of the tunnel, I always had a rough life, and horrific childhood.. But my depression was caused by an actual medical issue rather than being depressed due to my circumstances. I have a hormone imbalance so bouts of depression, and a bunch of other crappy symptoms are just part of my life... so I understand more about depression that I did before I was diagnosed with my health issues, which has made me more empathetic in a way.. By reacting the way his mother did, ended up doing more harm than anything, he told me it took him a lot to ask for help, and she made him feel like he couldn’t talk to her or ask for help ever again, from that point he never brought it up to anyone else again..until we started dating. 

Since COVID things have gotten so much worse for him, on top of that both of us has had such a an unbelievable string of bad luck, it honestly has been non stop problem after problem since summer 2019, we have been through so much, any human being who’s experienced even half the stuff we’ve had to deal with in the past year and a half would come out of it with severe depression, then dealing with COVID on top of all that.. I’m a strong person that can and has handled a lot in my life, and I’m struggling.. I can only imagine how he’s feeling.

For the first time since he was a kid he asked for help, he had a breakdown recently and told me he’s finally ready to try something.. but he’s not ready to see someone professionally, It really scares him. He always thinks of the worst possible outcomes, and his brain spirals with irrational thoughts, and he can’t stop or control it. He opened up about some of his fears to me, he’s terrified he will finally seek professional help, only to be told there’s nothing anyone can do, or that there’s nothing wrong with him, and that’s just how his brain works, and he’s just going to have to live like that the rest of his life, which in my opinion is highly unlikely.. but it’s something he’s legitimately afraid of. Also he’s afraid if he gets prescribed meds and they  will hinder his ability or loose interest in his creative passions. His one passion in life is music, and he’s insanely talented. His passion to create music is the one thing that’s kept him going throughout his life, it was his only form of escape and release from his mental health struggles. He always tells me that music was his only love in his life, until he met me, now he’s got two loves, and we (me and his passion for creating music) are the only things stopping him from just giving up and ending his life. He has no other dreams/goals career wise, not because he’s lazy, or lacks drive.. but because he was born with such natural musical talents and it’s the one thing he’s exceptionally good at, that isn’t a struggle for him to accomplish... He’s very far from an unintelligent person.. but he’s never been able to find anything else that he’s so effortlessly good at. He always had to work extra hard at everything else just to be half as good as others, and he really doesn’t enjoy doing other stuff. Music is the one thing he’s just naturally good at, and I’m genuinely not just saying this because he’s my boyfriend, he’s got actual serious talent, he’s been playing guitar since he was 11 years old, I know a lot of people who can play guitar, but the majority of people treat it as a hobby.. they learn a few songs to play for people at parties, and that’s it. He’s never been satisfied with just learning other people’s music.. and he doesn’t just play an instrument as a hobby, he’s a true genuine artist in every aspect. He needs to be creating, writing music, song lyrics, right down to drawing and designing his own album covers. He’s been teaching himself guitar almost his whole life, but when he decided to write and produce his own album rather that work with a band, his reason for this being having absolute control of all creative aspects without compromise on his own vision, he started creating drum tracks, bass lines, and vocals with no prior experience or knowledge beyond the guitar.. and being exceptionally talented at all of it. I was always amazed with talent he possesses, but his ability to effortlessly just be great at instruments he had zero prior knowledge of blew me away.. He’s also painfully aware that having a successful, and profitable career doing what he’s great at, just being talented isn’t enough, sometimes it is.. but it’s an industry where success, or even at least getting a somewhat decent career out of is more dependent on dumb luck, meeting the right person, being at the right place at the right time, or connections people may have in the industry already, rather than actually having talent, passion, drive and willingness to put in hard work... there’s the possibility he could spend his whole life working at something, genuinely putting everything he has into what he’s good at and end up with nothing to show for it. It’s an extremely unfair industry, and I know this is something he constantly struggles with, to him it’s unfair that the one gift he was born with is something that he has no absolutely control over being successful at, almost anything else can be accomplished by working hard enough, and by putting in genuine effort you will eventually accomplish what you set out to do, and having a natural talent for whatever it is gives you an advantage in that field. If you are blessed enough to have a natural for almost anything else, and you are dedicated enough, and want to peruse a career with whatever your good at you will succeed, even if it takes longer for whatever reason, there’s a clear path you can follow, you can create a plan, and an eventually reach an end goal that’s realistic, and guaranteed in the end. He sees musicians all the time that have managed a decent career in the industry, that have gotten famous, bands on the radio, and have just generally gotten lucky that aren’t half as talented as he is, and I really feel for him.. I would feel absolutely terrible if I was in a similar situation. Its so hard on him, it’s something he wants so badly, and he absolutely genuinely deserves to find success doing something that he loves, I feel like everyone deserves to love what they do in life, or at least have a legitimate shot at it, if you put so much time and effort into working towards something you should at least be granted a fair shot at being successful without having to rely on opportunity that may never happen, or just pure dumb luck. I can’t imagine having so much talent and love for doing something, while knowing no matter how hard I work at it there’s a huge possibility to waste my entire life just to never accomplish anything would crush me.. and I’m a very tough person, he’s not he’s extremely fragile compared to me.. 

I did some research online and I seen that some people have had some success with St John’s Wort... He wants help, but isn’t ready for doctors and prescribed medication.. even if he was ready for all that, COVID had made it more complicated to find a doctor and proper treatment at the moment. He agreed to try the St John’s Wort, but he’s very sceptical.. and generally being very pessimistic about it. He doesn’t feel like it will do anything, and doesn’t have high hopes at all.. he’s on his 3rd day of taking 300mg 3x/day which is what the bottle suggests. Can anyone share their experience that they have had with this supplement? Whether it was bad or good.. anything really to let me have somewhat of an idea on what to expect, how long before he may get some sort of results, or at least know how long to try taking them before giving up on it doing anything.. I don’t want him to not feel anything and stop too soon, how long of a chance should he give it to work. Honestly I’ve never loved another human being as much as I love him, I just wish there was more I could do.. but I know that’s not how this stuff works. I’ve survived though such a hard life, most of the times he even feels bad bringing up how he feels to me, because despite his mental health problems, he’s had a very happy life.. good caring family, and general stability in his life. Which is the complete opposite of what I have experienced. I had a drug addict, toxic, and mentally abusive mother, alcoholic, junkie, bipolar father. And a very unhealthy relationship with the rest of my family. I basically raised myself, and my parents.. because someone needed to be the responsible one, I was being the responsible one at the age of 6.. I have a lot of health complications, and no clear future.. I probably would have done something more stable, and productive with my life if I was given the opportunity.. I’m smart, outgoing, and have a lot of hidden talents.. but I was dealt a bad hand, and have lived a life of constant struggle. Opening up to me about what he’s struggling with makes him feel like he’s unjustified, like what he’s struggling with is nothing compared to the stuff I’ve survived through.. most people who know me are amazed I managed to grow up to be a somewhat functional human, and not a drug addicted fuck up like my parents tried to turn me into, while I have a lot of mental scars from my past I have ended up a stronger person because of it..  I know he feels bad because his life was candy land compared to mine. I reassure him all the time that I understand his mental health problems are real, and just because his life wasn’t hard like mine, doesn’t make his suffering any less legitimate, and he’s fully justified to feel how he feels. I understand hard times, and what I went through in life if anything helped me be strong enough to handle helping him through his dark times.. I wish just for a second he could see himself through my eyes, he would see how much he actually deserves in life. I care about him so much, and nothing would make me happier than to see him become the successful, talented, amazing person I know he’s more than capable of becoming. I would do absolutely anything for him, and I try and be the absolute most supportive girlfriend that has ever existed, because I’ve never met a more deserving person.",t2_85b0xi9n,False,,0,False,St John’s Wort to treat symptoms.. has this worked for anyone?,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_jhnryh,False,dark,1.0,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603630761.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My boyfriend suffers from pretty bad depression. It’s something he’s struggled with his whole life. While I have gone through depression myself, and still struggle at times.. but nothing like he deals with. He’s opened up to me about how he feel more and more, and it’s pretty dark stuff. He feels like his brain never shuts off, and just constantly spirals out of control. He has very dark thoughts, hates humanity and the society we have no choice to be apart of. He constantly feels like everything is too much to handle, like his life is just one bad things after another.. to the point where he just expects the absolute worst all the time so he’s slightly less disappointed when everything goes wrong, as he knows it will. He has abused drugs, and sometimes still does.. mostly speed, because he says it’s the only time he can get quiet in his head because of the sleep deprivation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been going on since he was a kid. He told his mom when he was younger that he had bad thoughts in his head that scared him, loosely hinting at suicidal thoughts without actually saying it to her, and she kind of just got mad at him.. in my opinion it scared her, and that’s just how she reacted unwilling.. she has a very different personality than he does, she’s a very strong independent individual (she’s an Aries like I am, so I get it in a way) She always just made the best of bad situations, I was always the same. I never let myself stress or worry about stuff I had no control over, I didn’t see the point.. it just causes you mental harm, when there’s nothing you can do to change it anyway. Even in my worst periods of depression, I was still able to try and see the light at the end of the tunnel, I always had a rough life, and horrific childhood.. But my depression was caused by an actual medical issue rather than being depressed due to my circumstances. I have a hormone imbalance so bouts of depression, and a bunch of other crappy symptoms are just part of my life... so I understand more about depression that I did before I was diagnosed with my health issues, which has made me more empathetic in a way.. By reacting the way his mother did, ended up doing more harm than anything, he told me it took him a lot to ask for help, and she made him feel like he couldn’t talk to her or ask for help ever again, from that point he never brought it up to anyone else again..until we started dating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since COVID things have gotten so much worse for him, on top of that both of us has had such a an unbelievable string of bad luck, it honestly has been non stop problem after problem since summer 2019, we have been through so much, any human being who’s experienced even half the stuff we’ve had to deal with in the past year and a half would come out of it with severe depression, then dealing with COVID on top of all that.. I’m a strong person that can and has handled a lot in my life, and I’m struggling.. I can only imagine how he’s feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time since he was a kid he asked for help, he had a breakdown recently and told me he’s finally ready to try something.. but he’s not ready to see someone professionally, It really scares him. He always thinks of the worst possible outcomes, and his brain spirals with irrational thoughts, and he can’t stop or control it. He opened up about some of his fears to me, he’s terrified he will finally seek professional help, only to be told there’s nothing anyone can do, or that there’s nothing wrong with him, and that’s just how his brain works, and he’s just going to have to live like that the rest of his life, which in my opinion is highly unlikely.. but it’s something he’s legitimately afraid of. Also he’s afraid if he gets prescribed meds and they  will hinder his ability or loose interest in his creative passions. His one passion in life is music, and he’s insanely talented. His passion to create music is the one thing that’s kept him going throughout his life, it was his only form of escape and release from his mental health struggles. He always tells me that music was his only love in his life, until he met me, now he’s got two loves, and we (me and his passion for creating music) are the only things stopping him from just giving up and ending his life. He has no other dreams/goals career wise, not because he’s lazy, or lacks drive.. but because he was born with such natural musical talents and it’s the one thing he’s exceptionally good at, that isn’t a struggle for him to accomplish... He’s very far from an unintelligent person.. but he’s never been able to find anything else that he’s so effortlessly good at. He always had to work extra hard at everything else just to be half as good as others, and he really doesn’t enjoy doing other stuff. Music is the one thing he’s just naturally good at, and I’m genuinely not just saying this because he’s my boyfriend, he’s got actual serious talent, he’s been playing guitar since he was 11 years old, I know a lot of people who can play guitar, but the majority of people treat it as a hobby.. they learn a few songs to play for people at parties, and that’s it. He’s never been satisfied with just learning other people’s music.. and he doesn’t just play an instrument as a hobby, he’s a true genuine artist in every aspect. He needs to be creating, writing music, song lyrics, right down to drawing and designing his own album covers. He’s been teaching himself guitar almost his whole life, but when he decided to write and produce his own album rather that work with a band, his reason for this being having absolute control of all creative aspects without compromise on his own vision, he started creating drum tracks, bass lines, and vocals with no prior experience or knowledge beyond the guitar.. and being exceptionally talented at all of it. I was always amazed with talent he possesses, but his ability to effortlessly just be great at instruments he had zero prior knowledge of blew me away.. He’s also painfully aware that having a successful, and profitable career doing what he’s great at, just being talented isn’t enough, sometimes it is.. but it’s an industry where success, or even at least getting a somewhat decent career out of is more dependent on dumb luck, meeting the right person, being at the right place at the right time, or connections people may have in the industry already, rather than actually having talent, passion, drive and willingness to put in hard work... there’s the possibility he could spend his whole life working at something, genuinely putting everything he has into what he’s good at and end up with nothing to show for it. It’s an extremely unfair industry, and I know this is something he constantly struggles with, to him it’s unfair that the one gift he was born with is something that he has no absolutely control over being successful at, almost anything else can be accomplished by working hard enough, and by putting in genuine effort you will eventually accomplish what you set out to do, and having a natural talent for whatever it is gives you an advantage in that field. If you are blessed enough to have a natural for almost anything else, and you are dedicated enough, and want to peruse a career with whatever your good at you will succeed, even if it takes longer for whatever reason, there’s a clear path you can follow, you can create a plan, and an eventually reach an end goal that’s realistic, and guaranteed in the end. He sees musicians all the time that have managed a decent career in the industry, that have gotten famous, bands on the radio, and have just generally gotten lucky that aren’t half as talented as he is, and I really feel for him.. I would feel absolutely terrible if I was in a similar situation. Its so hard on him, it’s something he wants so badly, and he absolutely genuinely deserves to find success doing something that he loves, I feel like everyone deserves to love what they do in life, or at least have a legitimate shot at it, if you put so much time and effort into working towards something you should at least be granted a fair shot at being successful without having to rely on opportunity that may never happen, or just pure dumb luck.

,depression,"My parents are in a rollercoaster of a relationship. They can be chill one day with my mom hugging and saying cute things with my dad. But then the next, they can loudly scream at each other over something that happened. My mom always seems to be blaiming things on my dad and in vice versa.

Now, whenever I see my mom being happy with my dad, I feel like something is off. An example: recently my dad had a car accident while being drink (DUI). They were super mad at each other for a few weeks and both said that they were going to make one or the other leave the house and never come back. This same thing happened 2 times in the past with them also saying they will get separated. But they never do. Some time will pass it they would forget about it completely and start acting like they love each other, if I can even call it that. 

I think that my mom is being all lovey with my dad just so they dont start fighting again or something like that idk. In the afternoon, my dad would go outside and drink with our neighbors and sometimes come back drunk. My dad isnt mad or violent when he is drunk, in fact he is more outgoing and more open when he is. This is what I fear the most. That my mom would accidentally say something negative about him and he would be open about it and turn angry and they would start fighting again. 

I have no idea where I am going with this but this relationship that I witness everyday just makes me so sad for both of my parents. Its makes me more sad when I think about it from their perspectives. God, why are my parents like this. I'm so damn confused and sad about it. I don't expect any responses this is just me venting or whatever.

I don't tend to expose my feelings or thoughts to anyone because everyone thinks I am happy all the time when in reality I get sad when I'm alone. I feel like I have to act like I'm happy sometimes because my family needs to be around happy people sometimes. I also do this around my friends because they also seem to be down sometimes. I always put others first instead of myself. This in turn leaves me with so much fucking emotions inside in my chest that sometimes it hurts. Like a weight and I feel like I just need to let this go somewhere. And no I don't feel like talking about it to anyone because everyone knows that I'm very happy and i don't have any mental issues. My 13 year old sister is diagnosed with anxiety and I feel like the only reason I dont have any of this is because I pushed it so fucking deep in the back of my chest. I feel like it's starting to catch up to me as I constantly feel an ache in my chest and I won't eat properly. 

All I have to do is push it farther back right? Pretend like everything is good right? Jesus, writing this makes me even sadder. The thing is, I don't  have suicidal thoughts or anything, I just feel like I'm huddled in a corner in the dark. I feel like screaming rn. But I'll worry about it later because I have overdue assignment to turn in. 

I'm only sad sometimes but when I get sad, I get really really sad. I don't even know if I'm sad or not. I just feel nothing, just an ache in my chest. Am I depressed? I don't think so. Maybe. I feel like I dont have feelings anymore.

,depression,"Hello my name is Nasir and this is my first time using reddit. I just needed a place to vent and get some opinions and advice on my situation from different people. Before I turned 18 (I am 24 now but giving a little backstory) my life was like any normal person. I had just graduated high school and felt good about that. I like to think that I am very intelligent but I graduated with an average gpa (2.5). I could have done better but I was a huge procrastinator and am very forgetful in general so that didn’t help either. I now realize what my teachers and grandparents told me about “not applying myself”. They held me to higher expectations because they knew my potential, what I could do if I actually tried. But I didn’t listen. I didn’t look towards the future I lived in the moment. “I don’t feel like doing this work so I won’t”, is what I constantly thought to myself or I would just honestly forget to do it or wait until the day before so it was half done. My gpa when I graduated was the result of me not applying myself. It is an average gpa, yes but I could have done so much better. It’s funny when I like look back on it now but I was so lazy I almost failed English and P.E. quite possibly two of the easiest A’s in the curriculum. I didn’t take it seriously which was my mistake. After highschool I enrolled to Purdue University in Indiana. I live on the state line so it was a 10 minute drive from my house. My grandfather would take me because I didn’t have my own car or a license (still don’t). Even though it is so close I still live in Illinois so I was charged for out of state tuition which was very unfortunate. The change from high school to college was not as drastic as I thought it would be but I get extreme anxiety in new environments and when I have to meet new people so my heart was beating extremely fast. I also overanalyze every aspect of every conversation I have and I feel as if every person I make eye contact with even for a fraction of a second is judging me but I’ve always been like that. Up until recently (probably the last 2 years) I have gotten over that feeling but the social anxiety is still there and being nervous in new environments. Even talking online makes me nervous. I wasn’t going into college blind either, I knew I had to apply for financial aid and scholarships and grants to help pay for my tuition and possibly get a job; but just like high school I didn’t take it seriously and instead of working I would skip classes to go play video games with my friends. The difference between them and me is they probably had free time to actually play. I was supposed to be doing my work. I didn’t go to college to play games I went to try and get a higher education that would open career pathways. I had my entire life planned out when I was 18 but we can all agree that life sometimes doesn’t work out the way you plan it to. Just like high school I was living in the moment and not looking towards the future, blind to the fact that time is always moving. Before I knew it, the end of the semester was upon me. My tuition for the semester was 9k. FAFSA covered half but I didn’t apply for any scholarships/grants and I certainly didn’t have a job. I could have taken out a loan but I wasn’t thinking about any of that. My grades were also terrible as well due to what I stated earlier: not putting school as my first priority. I couldn’t pay the tuition so I dropped out. I feel as if all of this could have been avoided if I gave myself a reality check but it was too late. That’s when I started to first feel depressed. Well it was more so nihilism. I came to the realization that I have to work the rest of my life just to die making everything I ever accomplished useless. Some people really see no issue with this because it’s just a normal thing but that’s a conversation for another day. After I dropped out I started looking for jobs. No luck. That is what made me REALLY depressed; I just want a job just to earn some money and try to change my quality of life but I couldn’t find one and still can’t. Covid-19 turning into a pandemic didn’t help my case either. Not only that but I had some family issues going on during my last year of high school to the dropout period up until even now. My father was doing parole at our house (he is no longer here thank God) and he’s extremely racist, homophobic and misogynistic, but mainly misogynistic. His general distrust and degradation of women angers me seeing as I was raised by one (my grandmother) and I turned out just fine so the “a man can’t raise a women” argument is stupid. He is a part of my depression because I failed driver’s ed in high school (it was a free class for us) because of him and I could have had my driver’s license by now if he didn’t ruin it. He went out one day and when he came home he hit me because the dishes weren’t washed (I forgot to wash them) and his following statement was “Your grandma shouldn’t have to come home from work to wash dishes.” I agree, she shouldn’t have to come home from work to wash dishes but every time I try to help around the house she doesn’t want me to. She’s been a working woman all of her life if she wanted help she would ask. I did other housework like mopping and taking out the trash anyway. Back to the hitting part. I wear glasses so when he hit me it was just enough force to break my glasses and I’m like Velma when I don’t have my glasses, I can only see about 6 inches in front of me before everything gets blurry. After he broke my glasses he told me not to tell my grandma so I didn’t because I was scared of him. I’m sure you know I can’t get behind the wheel with my type of vision. This was near the end of the course where driving tests were becoming more frequent and I wouldn’t be able to get a new pair of glasses or even contacts in enough time so I failed. I have resented him ever since. I never felt any emotion towards him anyway because the time in my life to form that bond has long since passed. Maybe something could have been salvaged if I was 13-16 but it’s too late. So all that combined with me not being able to find a job has taken its toll on me. I was doing fine for a while because I didn’t stay focused on my past and how it turned out but I randomly started thinking about it and I just started breaking down and crying. This one job I applied to was going to hire me but this was when Covid has just started so they turned everyone down and now I’m still looking. I could have went back to school but I have no motivation to do so anymore. My Pastor always tells me I don’t need to go to college which is true, there are other options but like I said before the realization of working for the rest of my life just to die has really demotivated me from doing anything. I guess I do have a goal though. If I get a job I would like to save money for a PC and become a streamer so I guess that’s a start but right now I’m in a limbo. If my grandmother were to die (God forbid) I would be hopeless because she pays the bills for the house and keeps me fed. It’s because of the appreciation I have for her taking care of me even now is why I feel useless to her even though she has expressed the opposite multiple times. I feel like a burden because I don’t have a source of income. She is retired and has to work with $1200 a month. I don’t want her to spend the rest of her life living like that. That is why I feel so powerless to help her and to help myself. I apologize that this post is so long I just needed vent a little. My friends and family (well my grandpa is clueless) have a general idea of how I feel but haven’t really given me the comfort I envisioned they would due to me not being able to properly express my emotions. I have NEVER felt this way before so the overwhelming despair and depression I felt was a first for me and now it has returned. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this. A response is not required but welcomed all the same.

I take meds to help me sleep through the night. Sometimes they put me in a deep sleep for around 12 hours if I take it too late in the night. I have nightmares every night but last nights nightmares were hitting me hard emotionally, and playing on every part I hate about myself. 

I woke up and immediately cried. I went to go watch a movie to calm myself down, but my roommate was there along with his girlfriend and friend. I tried to watch a movie but they kept interrupting, and left random clothes and items around the living room and I guess that was my last straw. Every issue I had with my roommate bubbled up and i was just furious. It's like, my roommate became my roommate even though I told the other people in the apartment that I didnt want him there, because he made my friends uncomfortable. I cant get an emotional support animal because he hates animals. I have to ask permission to invite people over but he brings his gf over whenever the hell he wants. I cant invite my close friends over because he makes them uncomfortable. He complains about me being messy then he and his girlfriend leave beer bottles everywhere and just throw shit where they want. I don't know how to put it any other way, but I despise him now. 

I texted my boyfriend (who is also a roommate) to vent and he told me it was irrational. We argued and I ended the conversation by telling him he could keep the roommate, but that I was leaving. Then I grabbed my phone, backpack and wallet and sort of ran away. It was snowy, so I hid under some pine trees and planned to go to the nearby grocery store and buy some pills that I could overdose on.

 This whole time I'm completely irrational, haven't brushed my hair, wearing mismatched socks, and crying under a pine tree. I dont know what was going on, but i was panicking but not in a panic attack way. It was like my brain was furious and wanted to end it all. My therapist told me I have ""subconscious suicidal ideation"" but I've never actively tried to harm/kill myself, but today I had a big urge to. I sat outside under the pine trees until I was so cold my body didnt want to move anymore, but I got up anyways.

For some reason, i didnt stop at the grocery store,  i kept walking until i reached my work. My coworkers were nice to me even though I looked like a maniac, and they tried to cheer me up. It was sweet. I stayed at a local coffee shop. I went there with the intention of drawing, but I just stared at the table for about an hour instead. My boyfriend called me until I answered, then picked me up. I threw up when I got home and we talked it out on the bathroom floor.

Should I take the risk now to get treatment now or wait until im an adult in about 6 months?&lt;/p&gt;

Side effects became less intense after two weeks tried it for 4 weeks total and no improvement.

Added 150 mg buproprion then and felt an instant improvement. Tapered of the lexapro and 2 months into 150 mg bupoprion in the mornings and 150 in the evening now (SR). Have noticed  a significant improvement in mood, motivation and focus but the insomnia is still in full swing and I get super vivid dreams when I do get any sleep. Afternoon exhaustion and late night racing thoughts. Tinnitus and nausea to the point i have no appetite. Try to make it through on smoothies and juices but that is a struggle to keep down those too. 

Doc said to stick with this regime though for another month?

*To be noted I had bad insomnia and anxiety with the depression so I have been told it is hard to treat and trial and error are required with finding the correct medication?

I am new to reddit — I’ve been browsing around for a while now, but I’ve lacked the courage to post anything. I can relate to a lot of what has been posted, and I now feel like it’s time that I share my story:

I grew up in a chaotic household (like I’m sure a lot of you have): my mother was mentally unstable given my father lacked a steady income and was constantly finding and experimenting with entrepreneurial projects that failed to provide our family with any steady source of income. My most vivid memories (when I can actually remember, which is difficult when you have MDD) are my parents fighting constantly about mortgage payments, infidelity on business trips, and lack of extended family support. My parents divorced when I was 12 — I I lived in multiple houses growing up with my mom, and my dad has been in and out of my life ever since, though he’s been more involved these past couple of years (I actually lived on his couch from 25 to 26).

However, fortunately, I was able to push through (or ignore)a lot of these family problems growing up, though I was still considered weird by a lot of people my age. I was an excellent high school student: I graduated with a 4.2 gpa and played two sports in which I was a captain for one them senior year. I went on to an elite private college on the east coast in which I played a varsity sport for 4 years. I had an amazing gf who I loved very much (we were together for 4 years in college, and one year after). I was confident and genuinely believed in myself: I didn’t have a fake belief in myself, but a deep love and care for myself. I graduated with a solid gpa as well as a couple of awards for both sports and academics.

After I graduated, my life spiraled out of control: I became deeply, deeply depressed and started to hate my self, a hatred so deep words cannot describe how I felt. I was stuck at a job that meant nothing to me, and spent my weekends indulging in alcohol and marijuana (my brain doesn’t react well to either of those substances). Each day I started to feel more and more “out of it”, emotionally numb, and dysphoric: I felt nothing, there was nothing to live for, and I stopped enjoying everything that used to bring me meaning and joy. I quit my job after 7 months, and I moved back home, leaving behind everything that I worked hard for: a job, friends that respected me, and a loving gf. 

After moving back, I was EXTREMELY heart broken after leaving my ex: I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t able to be the rock and support system for her anymore, I couldn’t understand why I felt so emotionally numb, and I couldn’t understand why there wasn’t any intimacy or passion in the sex or relationship anymore. I started to question my entire existence and identity, and I fell into the darkest depression a person could fall into: I literally questioned everything — I didn’t know my name, my gender, where I was born, my sexual orientation. Nothing felt real — I couldn’t tell real memories from fake memories. I had no sense of self which was slowly destroying me. 

Fast forward a year - I was living at home, unemployed and miserable. I ended up taking the GRE and applied to a graduate program at an Ivy League school. Got in, did that, but I still hated my self the whole time (depression, dysphoria, anxiety) it was just that I was able to hide it and distract myself in academics.

After getting my grad degree, I moved home, and I failed to keep in contact with everyone I met in school. Again, the cycle continued: depressed, dysphoric, unemployed, anxious, living at home, and lonely. I couldn’t figure out how to hold on to a job or even find one; I just wanted to go back to school again for the third time, take out more loans, and become further in debt. I stopped caring completely, about everything.

I started to watch porn, have sex with random girls to boost my self esteem (it never did) and drink heavily, and I also got into COCAINE, which completely destroyed me: I felt worthless and lost before, oh boy did cocaine just absolutely fuck me up. My delusions and dysphoria started to worsen: my life goal was to become a cocaine dealer in Mexico (started looking at plane tickets) or a lady boy in Thailand. My entire sex drive was in ruins: I had nothing solid to hold onto, again, a very fragile self image around who I was as human being with very intense dysphoria. For example, I would have repeated videos in my brain of being raped over and over again: I genuinely believed I was a victim of childhood rape, but there is no evidence of that. I went on a cocaine and alcohol binge one night, and the only thing I remember is the next morning being driven to the emergency room: I had gotten the shit beat out of me at the bar, been handcuffed  by the cops, driven home by them, and started threatening to kill myself as well as my entire family. At the emergency room, I had an insanely high blood alcohol content as well as cocaine in my system (even the day after). I talked to the social worker/psychologist there, and he determined that I was suicidal and delusional, so he put me in the schizophrenic unit of the psych ward for three days, but after the first day I was moved to the major depression and anxiety unit as they believed that was a better fit. 

I got out after 4 or 5 days, and I went to see a mental health professional voluntarily for the first time since I was a child: I saw a psychologist when I was young, but that was it. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic features, and I was prescribed Abilify and Lexapro. I had been taking both for about a year and a half; however, I went cold turkey on the Lexapro two or three weeks ago and tapered off the Abilify myself a month and a half ago: I just couldn’t stand the weight gain ( I probably gained 50 lbs) and it really didn’t make me feel at peace with myself, it was a bandaid, and I genuinely knew that from the bottom of my heart.

Moved back to the Ivy League town where I graduated from, and I was able to find a job doing consulting work (think about one of those jobs that only rich connected people get); but I quit after 8 months because I wanted to become a professional poker player. I moved to Las Vegas, got an apartment, and started playing at the casinos. Covid happened, I lost my money, and moved back home again. Again, cycle repeats itself. 

I recently found a job in another state doing bullshit office work: think Dilbert or Office Space. But, I have come to terms with it, and I’m doing my best to find joy in the little things. I have completely quit alcohol: it’s not even an option. I’m done with it, forever. Drugs and alcohol absolutely crush me. 

I still have intense bouts of crippling depression and anxiety attacks which I’ve come to realize are fueled by my inability to understand who I am or hold onto any sort of solid self image of myself at the deepest level: this prevents me from seeking out genuine relationships with other people, whether that be friends or a significant other. I am still questioning all aspects of my self: Am I straight or gay? Am I male or female? Where am I from? What is my name? Who are my family members? Memories don’t seem real, nothing seems real anymore. It’s wearing me down, and I can’t imagine that a person could go through so much pain and still exist. It’s a miracle.

I’m seeing a new psychiatrist, and I am hopeful he will help. I’ve been stable before, relatively content and at peace with myself; I am hoping to get back to that place again. I can’t give up.

You’re literally telling me to be someone I’m not, to project a fake persona, just to meet the needs of what we see as ‘normal’ social interaction. Confidence is a feeling, it’s not something you can train easily if at all.

I still have a few good ones, real ones, left but they all live in the city I moved away from for college. 

I’m left in my room playing video games to pass the time. Coming in late on many of my class assignments. Getting absolutely bum nothing done. I work only to pay the bills. Never before in my life have I felt a ‘fuel tank’ of socializing in my body. It takes days for me to refill it up just to have lunch with somebody, before dipping back into this dark peril of no energy for anybody or myself. 

Bipolar runs in my family. I fear I have it but never before a year ago have I felt so much immobilizing sadness and self-hatred/doubt. I get nothing done because I’m depressed, and I’m depressed because I get nothing done. 

Today, I was supposed to have game night with my former roommates. I was actually quite excited at the prospect, even with my ex being a part of the group I originally introduced her to.

,depression,"Who cares? We have no freedom. We are all slaves to the global elites that want to leech our talents from us and then sell it for a price and they were here first and will always be ahead of anyone else or you are slaves to your parents. The internet has become boring because there is a lack of connection. I just want to be put out of my suffering for good. I wish that euthanasia was legal for people with mental disorders.

My parents have robbed me of my childhood through abuse and corporal punishment from teachers as well as them(yes I was forced to go around naked in front of everyone and hit with a cane and told to touch my feet if I didn't follow the teachers orders) and the teachers/parents and uncle all got away with it.

My parents are narcissist/toxic but they give me a roof over my head but they are so controlling and treated me as their slave/property rather than a loving child and abused the shit out of me by slapping me and claim to 'love me, plus with the on going health problems, I don't think I want to live on anymore. I just wish suicide was easier and painless as possible.

We are slaves to the global elites and corporate fascists that rule this world. It's their way or the highway.'Despite the shit they have done I still love them because I am too human but fuck this.

,depression,"At the beginning of this year, I was doing well. Full-time job, living on my own in the city, decent social life, and an incredible boyfriend - everything I needed to feel successful.

When the pandemic hit, things didn't change too much. My sister who lived in the same city had me stay with her because she was lonely and it was safer. A few months later I had lost my job and was not receiving unemployment. I was in financial ruin, my sister begrudgingly fed me and consistently hung it over my head that I could not contribute to our new way of life.

When numbers started to drop, I started to spend more time at my boyfriend's place. He really made me feel better about my situation and listened to me cry about how my sister was making me feel - a worthless burden.

Now, I am freelancing within my field, it's not enough to pay for rent so I have no place to live. I have not stayed with my sister in over a month, because of how she treats me when I am around. We used to be best friends and I can feel our relationship fading with each passing day. I try to text her about things that happen in the day or send her memes, but all she responds with is ""cool"". Never has she seemed so disinterested in me. And the only time she really talks to me is to scold me about something.

Never in my life have I felt so worthless.

I'm so thankful that I have my boyfriend, but I can't help but feel like the same cycle of events will eventually unfold. He has told me that I can spend as much time as I need at his place, but I am worried that eventually he will grow cynical towards me. When I stay there I do contribute to expenses and have offered to help with rent. I am just so worried that this boy that I love so unconditionally will turn on me as my sister did. I already lost my sister/best friend and I can't bear to lose him.

I could stay at my parents. However, it is very far away from the city where my boyfriend is. And my dad is extremely emotionally abusive. It put me in a very unhealthy mindset, and I don't think it's fair to make someone live in a house with someone so abusive.

Before the pandemic, I did have a decent social life. But now I feel like I barely have any friends and no one I can really talk to. I am extremely lonely and often insecure about not having any close friends.

I feel so awful. I've had thoughts of suicide on and off throughout the pandemic. But frankly, I know that it would destroy my sister, even though right now it seems like she wants nothing to do with me ever.

I just don't know what to do at this point. But I hate myself, and I hate the situation I am in.

,depression,"I've posted a few times (and often deleted) about my turnaround almost six years ago. Long story short, I was unemployed, friendless and increasingly overweight for most of my 20s.

At 28 something changed, I kinda snapped out of it and started a career. From less than $100k earned in my entire life, to a six figure salary in less than five years. From abusive relationships and meaningless friendships to loving partners and supportive friends. From being almost 300lbs back to my high school weight of 185.

That worked for a while. I continued to achieve success, impressing friends and family, getting constantly promoted and given more responsibility at work. I bought a house, my first brand new car, an upper management position at a tech company. All before I turned 34.

But along the way I made some bad decisions. I sabotaged relationships with people who loved me, including a woman I thought I might marry. I started behaving recklessly, spending thousands of dollars a month on alcohol and drugs. Eventually, the stress and my own self hatred became too much. I took a sabbatical from work back in June 2020, even though during the pandemic (and in America) I knew I was very privileged to still have such a high income and benefits including healthcare.

I thought I would focus on my health; mental, physical and financial. I'm not a dumb person, I knew I needed to lose some weight after finding myself 30-40 pounds overweight. I knew I needed to more strictly follow a budget and make long term financial plans. I knew I needed to get back into therapy, which I was doing at the beginning of the year but quit after not getting the help I felt I needed, not seeing the results I wanted.

It has not gone well. I left town for a month, had a great experience travelling the country with my best friend. But when I returned home, I felt so defeated. I reached out to my old boss and the CEO of my former company, but after a week or so realized I wasn't in a position to go back and do my job. I have no friends, even the people I was still close with I've pushed away and deliberately (and unnecessarily harshly) sabotaged my relationships.

I don't **want** to get better anymore. I have to sell some my non tax advantaged investments in order to pay my bills next month (mortgage, car loan, credit cards for ""normal"" monthly spending). I've burned through tens of thousands of dollars, and I acknowledge I'm very privileged to be in even that situation.

I've got a few more months of runway before I would have to start selling retirement investments, but frankly I want to exit more permanently after finalizing my ""post-life"" arrangements so that what I do have can go to those I still care about, even if they don't feel like I do anymore.",t2_170kz6,False,,0,False,"Those of you who overcame severe mental health issues to achieve social, personal and/or professional success... what did you do when it all fell apart?",[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_jhmu3b,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603626341.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve posted a few times (and often deleted) about my turnaround almost six years ago.

,depression,"Depressed and anxious

I am new to reddit — I’ve been browsing around for a while now, but I’ve lacked the courage to post anything. I can relate to a lot of what has been posted, and I now feel like it’s time that I share my story:

I grew up in a chaotic household (like I’m sure a lot of you have): my mother was mentally unstable given my father lacked a steady income and was constantly finding and experimenting with entrepreneurial projects that failed to provide our family with any steady source of income. My most vivid memories (when I can actually remember, which is difficult when you have MDD) are my parents fighting constantly about mortgage payments, infidelity on business trips, and lack of extended family support. My parents divorced when I was 12 — I I lived in multiple houses growing up with my mom, and my dad has been in and out of my life ever since, though he’s been more involved these past couple of years (I actually lived on his couch from 25 to 26).

However, fortunately, I was able to push through (or ignore)a lot of these family problems growing up, though I was still considered weird by a lot of people my age. I was an excellent high school student: I graduated with a 4.2 gpa and played two sports in which I was a captain for one them senior year. I went on to an elite private college on the east coast in which I played a varsity sport for 4 years. I had an amazing gf who I loved very much (we were together for 4 years in college, and one year after). I was confident and genuinely believed in myself: I didn’t have a fake belief in myself, but a deep love and care for myself. I graduated with a solid gpa as well as a couple of awards for both sports and academics.

After I graduated, my life spiraled out of control: I became deeply, deeply depressed and started to hate my self, a hatred so deep words cannot describe how I felt. I was stuck at a job that meant nothing to me, and spent my weekends indulging in alcohol and marijuana (my brain doesn’t react well to either of those substances). Each day I started to feel more and more “out of it”, emotionally numb, and dysphoric: I felt nothing, there was nothing to live for, and I stopped enjoying everything that used to bring me meaning and joy. I quit my job after 7 months, and I moved back home, leaving behind everything that I worked hard for: a job, friends that respected me, and a loving gf. 

After moving back, I was EXTREMELY heart broken after leaving my ex: I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t able to be the rock and support system for her anymore, I couldn’t understand why I felt so emotionally numb, and I couldn’t understand why there wasn’t any intimacy or passion in the sex or relationship anymore. I started to question my entire existence and identity, and I fell into the darkest depression a person could fall into: I literally questioned everything — I didn’t know my name, my gender, where I was born, my sexual orientation. Nothing felt real — I couldn’t tell real memories from fake memories. I had no sense of self which was slowly destroying me. 

Fast forward a year - I was living at home, unemployed and miserable. I ended up taking the GRE and applied to a graduate program at an Ivy League school. Got in, did that, but I still hated my self the whole time (depression, dysphoria, anxiety) it was just that I was able to hide it and distract myself in academics.

After getting my grad degree, I moved home, and I failed to keep in contact with everyone I met in school. Again, the cycle continued: depressed, dysphoric, unemployed, anxious, living at home, and lonely. I couldn’t figure out how to hold on to a job or even find one; I just wanted to go back to school again for the third time, take out more loans, and become further in debt. I stopped caring completely, about everything.

I started to watch porn, have sex with random girls to boost my self esteem (it never did) and drink heavily, and I also got into COCAINE, which completely destroyed me: I felt worthless and lost before, oh boy did cocaine just absolutely fuck me up. My delusions and dysphoria started to worsen: my life goal was to become a cocaine dealer in Mexico (started looking at plane tickets) or a lady boy in Thailand. My entire sex drive was in ruins: I had nothing solid to hold onto, again, a very fragile self image around who I was as human being with very intense dysphoria. For example, I would have repeated videos in my brain of being raped over and over again: I genuinely believed I was a victim of childhood rape, but there is no evidence of that. I went on a cocaine and alcohol binge one night, and the only thing I remember is the next morning being driven to the emergency room: I had gotten the shit beat out of me at the bar, been handcuffed  by the cops, driven home by them, and started threatening to kill myself as well as my entire family. At the emergency room, I had an insanely high blood alcohol content as well as cocaine in my system (even the day after). I talked to the social worker/psychologist there, and he determined that I was suicidal and delusional, so he put me in the schizophrenic unit of the psych ward for three days, but after the first day I was moved to the major depression and anxiety unit as they believed that was a better fit. 

I got out after 4 or 5 days, and I went to see a mental health professional voluntarily for the first time since I was a child: I saw a psychologist when I was young, but that was it. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic features, and I was prescribed Abilify and Lexapro. I had been taking both for about a year and a half; however, I went cold turkey on the Lexapro two or three weeks ago and tapered off the Abilify myself a month and a half ago: I just couldn’t stand the weight gain ( I probably gained 50 lbs) and it really didn’t make me feel at peace with myself, it was a bandaid, and I genuinely knew that from the bottom of my heart.

Moved back to the Ivy League town where I graduated from, and I was able to find a job doing consulting work (think about one of those jobs that only rich connected people get); but I quit after 8 months because I wanted to become a professional poker player. I moved to Las Vegas, got an apartment, and started playing at the casinos. Covid happened, I lost my money, and moved back home again. Again, cycle repeats itself. 

I recently found a job in another state doing bullshit office work: think Dilbert or Office Space. But, I have come to terms with it, and I’m doing my best to find joy in the little things. I have completely quit alcohol: it’s not even an option. I’m done with it, forever. Drugs and alcohol absolutely crush me. 

I still have intense bouts of crippling depression and anxiety attacks which I’ve come to realize are fueled by my inability to understand who I am or hold onto any sort of solid self image of myself at the deepest level: this prevents me from seeking out genuine relationships with other people, whether that be friends or a significant other. I am still questioning all aspects of my self: Am I straight or gay? Am I male or female? Where am I from? What is my name? Who are my family members? Memories don’t seem real, nothing seems real anymore. It’s wearing me down, and I can’t imagine that a person could go through so much pain and still exist. It’s a miracle.

I’m seeing a new psychiatrist, and I am hopeful he will help. I’ve been stable before, relatively content and at peace with myself; I am hoping to get back to that place again. I can’t give up.

Thanks for reading.

I left some stuff out, but that’s pretty much the gist of it. Would love to hear some feedback or stories you have. Let me know if  you can relate to any parts of my experience.",t2_88u5bip9,False,,0,False,Please help,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_jhm5sd,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603623346.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depressed and anxious&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am new to reddit — I’ve been browsing around for a while now, but I’ve lacked the courage to post anything. I can relate to a lot of what has been posted, and I now feel like it’s time that I share my story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a chaotic household (like I’m sure a lot of you have): my mother was mentally unstable given my father lacked a steady income and was constantly finding and experimenting with entrepreneurial projects that failed to provide our family with any steady source of income. My most vivid memories (when I can actually remember, which is difficult when you have MDD) are my parents fighting constantly about mortgage payments, infidelity on business trips, and lack of extended family support. My parents divorced when I was 12 — I I lived in multiple houses growing up with my mom, and my dad has been in and out of my life ever since, though he’s been more involved these past couple of years (I actually lived on his couch from 25 to 26).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, fortunately, I was able to push through (or ignore)a lot of these family problems growing up, though I was still considered weird by a lot of people my age. I was an excellent high school student: I graduated with a 4.2 gpa and played two sports in which I was a captain for one them senior year. I went on to an elite private college on the east coast in which I played a varsity sport for 4 years. I had an amazing gf who I loved very much (we were together for 4 years in college, and one year after). I was confident and genuinely believed in myself: I didn’t have a fake belief in myself, but a deep love and care for myself. I graduated with a solid gpa as well as a couple of awards for both sports and academics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I graduated, my life spiraled out of control: I became deeply, deeply depressed and started to hate my self, a hatred so deep words cannot describe how I felt. I was stuck at a job that meant nothing to me, and spent my weekends indulging in alcohol and marijuana (my brain doesn’t react well to either of those substances).

,depression,"Humans are ugly creatures, inundated with flaws. There’s so much pain and suffering in the world, as a direct result of all the actions we’ve undertaken. All we do is *hurt* each other, and it’s something we can’t seem to stop doing. At their core, most people prioritize themselves, and no one cares about anyone else. How many charitable acts are done with an ulterior motive? How many times does someone do something kind to benefit themselves in some way, big or small, consciously or unconsciously? A lot.

I’ve never told anyone this, but there are so many times I’ll feel repulsed by people I interact with. I’ll think so many people are disgusting on an everyday basis, even my closest friends, if you could call them that. I’ll think they’re either being stupid, immature, shortsighted, mean-spirited, inconsiderate, or a slew of other adjectives. And you know what also happens often? I see myself in them. I see myself engaging in the same or worse behavior, I’ll see myself possessing those same undesirable qualities. It’s abhorrible. We’re all so flawed.

Are there good things about people? Absolutely. Many people are genuinely kind and compassionate, and are amazing people. In fact, I think everyone has things that make them awesome, and I generally like to believe I have faith in humanity. But I can’t help but feel this way.

I’ve been trying to think of why I can’t trust people. Maybe this is one reason why. I don’t trust people enough to not fall prey to their own flaws and hurt me. I don’t trust myself to not do the same and to hurt myself. And I really don’t want to feel hurt ever again, no matter what. I don’t even know how someone could earn my trust at this point. If that means being alone so be it.

I still care about everyone, even if they aren’t close to me. I still love everyone. I may not love my closest friends much more than strangers because I fear emotional attachment, but I love strangers more than most people do. And we’re not that bad.

\[Intro\]

They say ain't easy

They say life's hard.

Everybody's going through this, and I have to suck it up.

\[Verse 1\]

Wake up feelin' like screw my life, life's a challenge, I better work it right

Lost my love in this losin' economy, when I left US, it's like I lost my life

Folks losin' gwap as I'm losin' hope (1)

I took a beating, I lost my mind then I lost my time

Came to Korea with no will of my own, had to fly to survive

Everybody's working over-time, Even US is grinding like Korea

Long hours, Crazy Abuse, Little Pay and Rising price

Admired to you YouTubers, they start complainin', They feel the heat

\[Verse 2\]

Let me tell you 'bout my self, I'm not scared to flee

Been through so much pain, sometimes I wanna run outta here

Wanna know how it feels to have joy, wanna know how it feels have joy

I feel hatred of religion, I don't hate God

\[Hook\]

I never thought that I would be here

I never thought I'd get this far

They say life is like a hellhole

Well why am I burning in the dark?

Sometimes I just feel like hate my life, screw my life

Even when I'm up, I'm feeling down, hate my life

Most of the Koreans grindin' up or dead, hate my life, screw my life (2)

Sometimes I just feel like hate this world, hate this life, hate this universe

\[Verse 3\]

See I grew up in the US, where everybody's broke

A lot of them grown up poorly, they break down to cope

And life ain't easy in the Korea, suicide nation

They might not make it here tomorrow, like they're running outta hope

\[Hook\]

I never thought that I would be here

I never thought I'd get this far

They say life is like a hellhole

Well why am I burning in the dark?

Sometimes I just feel like hate my life, screw my life

Even when I'm up, I'm feeling down, hate my life

Most of the Koreans grindin' up or dead, hate my life, screw my life

Sometimes I just feel like hate this world, hate this life, hate this universe

&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you &amp;#39;bout my self, I&amp;#39;m not scared to flee&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been through so much pain, sometimes I wanna run outta here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wanna know how it feels to have joy, wanna know how it feels have joy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel hatred of religion, I don&amp;#39;t hate God&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Hook]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never thought that I would be here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never thought I&amp;#39;d get this far&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say life is like a hellhole&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well why am I burning in the dark?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I just feel like hate my life, screw my life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when I&amp;#39;m up, I&amp;#39;m feeling down, hate my life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the Koreans grindin&amp;#39; up or dead, hate my life, screw my life (2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I just feel like hate this world, hate this life, hate this universe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Verse 3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See I grew up in the US, where everybody&amp;#39;s broke&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of them grown up poorly, they break down to cope&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And life ain&amp;#39;t easy in the Korea, suicide nation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They might not make it here tomorrow, like they&amp;#39;re running outta hope&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Hook]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never thought that I would be here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never thought I&amp;#39;d get this far&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say life is like a hellhole&lt;/p&gt;

I haven’t been diagnosed with depression and anxiety but based on my experience and symptoms I do have. It is 4 years that I feel like this and it is impossible that it is not depression and anxiety. Nobody knows that I feel like this even my friends, family, and my relatives. I only share what I feel in my internet friends because they are strangers and they didn’t know me and my family. Imagine 4 years being like this and you still fighting, I know I do have suicide thoughts and I really want to kill myself but look I’m still alive. I really can’t get professional help because I do have lot of problems to fix, I’m not rich to get a professional help. I just really want to embrace my darkness and escape from reality, I always staying in my room for 24 hours and avoid socializing coz I can’t talk properly and I do have some things that people can’t understand. I know someday I’m going to die and I don’t need to fight anymore, people always ignore me and keep saying that get professional help but they didn’t know why I can’t ( I appreciate their kindness but I really can’t get professional help ) I’m killing myself because of my undiagnosed depression and anxiety. You know the feeling that you want to be alone but you also need help at the same time. Since birth I don’t have real friends/ best friends because of my appearance. Now I’m in the stage of being a burden and a manipulator. I do cryptic messages in my insta stories but I didn’t mean to manipulate coz its my account and I didn’t know someone can see my stories coz I’m not famous, The only purpose of that cryptic messages is to release my unanswered questions in my head, anger, sadness, etc. Because of my existence I feel like its my fault and I don’t know how to stop being me, But I’m still fighting. Sleeping is helpful to avoid depression thoughts but in the night, I can’t sleep and be depressed again. My life was 50 – 50 right now coz I don’t understand what’s happening. I also want to embrace this feeling than to socialize people because I know that humans are the monster in my thoughts. They bullied me, betray me, use me, and destroy my existence.

Today its been another fucking day being brought down by this piece of shit i call dad.
Every fucking time he whines that he is not happy with me because im too stupid or lazy(Even thought im in college,in a STEM field),because I cant do a fucking job right,im fucking sick of this shit.

,depression,"I’m really not sure where to post this, if there are any other subs that might be better please let me know. 

I’ve dealt with depression/anxiety my whole life, finding energy to do things feels impossible most the time. I make art and it’s my dream job, it’s fulfilling and spiritual for me and I wouldn’t want to do anything else. Unfortunately, I find that even when I have projects or ideas, I just can’t seem to find the energy inside me to act upon it. It’s like fighting with myself. It has to do with a lot of things that I won’t go too into detail, but I guess mostly I fear disappointing myself, so I avoid it sometimes. Other times it feels like I simply ran out of battery power to even do anything I want. 

But what is really weird to me that I don’t understand, is that when I’m at my job (current and past jobs) I work as hard as I can, I do amazing at time efficiency, multitasking, have high focus etc. I try to think about how other coworkers could use extra help, what could I do to make their shift easier? It’s like I go overboard working as hard as I can. Of course I mess up every now and then but I guess my point is, the work ethic I exhibit at my jobs is exactly the work ethic I want to have for myself and my art. It’s like I won’t allow it for myself?

I guess I’m curious if anyone understands. It makes me feel like I’m wasting my energy at my job, but I don’t think that’s necessarily it bc I was unemployed for a few months and I felt the same way. When I notice this pattern it makes me feel so lazy and worthless of myself and it’s heartbreaking to feel like I don’t want to make art.

&lt;p&gt;I’ve dealt with depression/anxiety my whole life, finding energy to do things feels impossible most the time. I make art and it’s my dream job, it’s fulfilling and spiritual for me and I wouldn’t want to do anything else. Unfortunately, I find that even when I have projects or ideas, I just can’t seem to find the energy inside me to act upon it. It’s like fighting with myself. It has to do with a lot of things that I won’t go too into detail, but I guess mostly I fear disappointing myself, so I avoid it sometimes. Other times it feels like I simply ran out of battery power to even do anything I want. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is really weird to me that I don’t understand, is that when I’m at my job (current and past jobs) I work as hard as I can, I do amazing at time efficiency, multitasking, have high focus etc. I try to think about how other coworkers could use extra help, what could I do to make their shift easier? It’s like I go overboard working as hard as I can. Of course I mess up every now and then but I guess my point is, the work ethic I exhibit at my jobs is exactly the work ethic I want to have for myself and my art. It’s like I won’t allow it for myself?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I’m curious if anyone understands. It makes me feel like I’m wasting my energy at my job, but I don’t think that’s necessarily it bc I was unemployed for a few months and I felt the same way. When I notice this pattern it makes me feel so lazy and worthless of myself and it’s heartbreaking to feel like I don’t want to make art. I’ve tried supplements for energy and they only do so much for me. It’s like something is stuck inside me that I can’t and don’t know how to fix. I journal daily and try to really look within myself to work these issues out, which has helped a lot, but again it feels like something is just not clicking.

,depression,"I don't know how to start this, I'm a 23 year old man and I couldn't feel more of a child than my entire life. It all started about 6 months ago when me and my girlfriend broke up. It's hard to put into words and truly recreate what happened during our relationship so this post is going to be a very long one

Some history of my relationships with my family and friends: I've been an integral and active part in my family since i was 14 years old. My family is amazing but this past year, especially after the breakup, I feel everything changing and i'm not sure if it's them or me. I've done so much and have had to make such hard decisions even at a young age regarding my family and dealing with them in such a way that leaves whichever mistake/situation at hand simply as that, a bad mistake/decision and showing love to my family, only ever wanting to help and fix the situation. My will-power for my entire life has been asburd, literally nothing would ever stand in my way, not forcefully either, but I always knew I was capable of achieving such great things if I put the work and effort toward them. My father is incredibly strong, but very critical. We've always had a good relationship, and my father's side of the family are so strong and secure, we never let any problem get to us, we'd always solve it or prevent it if possible. My mother's side is extremely caring, and I've had an amazing relationship with both of my grandmother's, especially on my mother's side. We'd talk all the time and go over problems, and we'd always help figure them out together. My mother re-married when i was 15 to her childhood friend after my parent's got divorced and although my step-father has seemingly been doing better, there was a lot of shit he put not only me but my mother and little brothers through, and he knows that I'll always be there to protect them. Except that's the problem, with how i've been feeling lately it seems impossible to be there for my family, let alone myself. And as much as I want to talk about it, It feels impossible since I've always been the one to answer the hard questions, to help guide myself, my friends, and my family towards the right path. If i talk to them now about how hard these past few months then am i not just a hypocrite for not taking my own advice and moving forward? I've never belittled anybody for their issues but I've always focused on ways to solve them and I cannot solve this feeling inside of me.

 When i got into my last relationship 2 years ago, i let every guard down with my girlfriend. I've been with women and have had short relationships, but this one was serious and I put everything into it. My ex-gf was incredibly intelligent and hard-working but very anxious and pretty introverted. I've always been a mix intro-extrovert, I enjoy my alone time but I've always been extremely close with my friends and love going out. Since this break-up though I have felt so depressed it is unreal. I've never felt anything like this in my life. I've excelled and am such a smart individual.But this last relationship had destroyed me. We met 1 month before school ended 2 years ago and started seeing each other. She lived 1.5 hours away from our university so she would go home when summer started. I started to feel pretty connected to this girl and she certainly cared about me. After a lot of hard thinking we decided to continue dating throughout summer and try to make things work, That summer I worked 8-5 in a family friend's detailing garage as a summer job, went to the gym each day after work, and every friday after work I'd make the hour and a half drive down to see this girl and be with her family,she would drive down as well, we kept it pretty even but i definitely did more driving which was alright by me, she was working a lot of hours and had to drive a lot so i didn't mind making a few extra trips. on some occasions I'd even stay sunday night if she wasn't feeling well or was anxious/wanting to talk and leave her house at 5:30am on Monday to make it to work, and I had no issues doing that since i knew how much it meant to her. I really started to fall for this girl. After our 2nd month in summer before we decided to make things serious we were talking on the phone and she asked me about being serious with our relationship and having our family's meet, we had agreed we would not see anybody else and we were still enjoying each other and figuring out how well we got together. And that night I told her I'd think about it and let her know tommorrow, it was a big decision and I was leaning towards yes but I understood the amount of love and commitment that goes into a healthy relationship and I wanted to make sure I was signing up for that and able to be that for her. When I woke up I was in pure bliss, I knew how much this girl loved me and I loved her too, and I admitted that to myself and I wanted to be with her. Her first text that morning was her saying sorry about what happened. After I asked, she told me that she had gone to her friend's house and they had done some things( not all the way) but damn well more than enough of what is even remotely ok. I was so caught off. I couldn't believe it, It had been not but 2 hours since she was professing her love for me that night, and me wanting to make sure I made the right decision she took it as I was breaking up with her and immediately flocked to get her condolence from a weird ass guy. I couldn't believe it. With any other person in my life I would've been done, without a question. It tore me apart. Her birthday was coming up that weekend and I had gotten her a gift bag with roses and a candle and a lot of her favorite lotions she'd always talk about and I was so happy to give it to her. I told her I needed some time and she began crying hysterically. I didn't talk to her much but decided to come down for her birthday. I hadn't decided whether it was going to be to break-up with her or to see what happened, there were multiple times during the drive I just thought fuck it I'll turn around she messed up and she knows exactly what she did, but for some reason I t was like a posession to keep driving down. When i got there we went downstairs and she was crying, begging me on her knees that I would stay, she had written a 2 page letter to me saying how much I'd done for her and how she wanted to die after what happened. I couldn't believe it, it was the hardest decision in my life, but I thought she meant what she said and I decided to give her another chance. I'm not a controlling person but as you'd imagine I lost all trust in her, she had a few guy friends in her nursing class that I met and were good guys that I trusted but a few i hadn't met. And i told her, I do not feel comfortable anymore with you talking to these guy-friends I haven't met. I felt like shit saying it, i know what it looks like and I know what it is. No person should have to limit their partner, or anyone on who they can keep in contact with. But I was so done at that point that was the only way I would stay, and if i got to meet them and see how they were that'd be a different story. I felt like complete shit even saying that but it was the only way I could trust her. I hadn't even heard of the guy that she went over to his house. But she agreed, and we worked things out together for the most part. We dated throughout summer and slowly the trust started to come back and I was still madly in love with this girl which is why it was so hard. At 21 we practically moved in together when school started. We'd stay at my mom's house for a week together, pack our things, and then go stay in her dorm together for a week. We went grocery shopping and did everything together. She didn't have many friends, and the ones she had were from her hometown besides her few nursing friends, and if I'm being honest they put her on the back-burner quite a bit and flopped out of plans to hang out pretty often although it meant a lot to her. And i felt bad about that. I was always there for her, and I told her it was their loss. I remember one day in bed her just staring at me with the most awe-filled and adoring eyes looking at me saying how i was her best friend and how much she loved me, and I said ofcourse sweetheart I love you too, it was just a fact. I cared deeply about this girl and I wanted the best for her and for her to succeed in anything she tried. A few months later, everything is going amazing and during our christmas break we were visiting her family's house for a week and she came to me saying her ex had messaged her on facebook. ""ok?"" I said, did he want or say anything. And she then went on to justify how she'd known him for so long and were still friends with him. News to me, I could see the painting on the wall already, and I fucking knew it and it tore me apart. How do you react to something like this knowing what happened before? If I say no immediately am i too controlling? If i pass it off am i a fool? I told her how uncomfortable it made me and if she just wanted to talk to him and catch up and that's all it was then that's fine by me. The worst part is that she acted so dumbfounded about why i might be hesitant of her talking with her ex, let alone after everything that happened in summer and how hard that was. Now it was just gone in her mind, ""never happpened, what's the matter?"" It blew my mind. But I said what I said and that was it, she promised it was just to catch up. Ofcourse over the next few weeks i notice she's on her phone a lot more than usual when we're in bed together watching TV, and I ask her whatsup? And she replies, oh I'm just texting ""name"", why what's the matter? And made me feel completely obsolete, there was no, oh he just texted me and I was responding or anything like that, she had been talking to this guy for 20 minutes straight each the night this week and on the 4th or 5th night I asked her whatsup and that's what she said, as if it was her mom. Keep in mind we both had busy schedules so we hardly had more than 3-4 hours to spend with each other each night. She was still loving and showing a lot of affection to me, she always needed a lot of attention more than anyone I've ever given in my life, friends or family combined and for the most part I was more than alright giving it to her, we had a blast, goofed off and had fun together. Eventually we got into a bit of an argument ( we hardly ever argued and the only serious one was during the first incident) about this guy and she said she wanted to meet him at starbucks, I was not ok with that. At first this ex was simply to talk to and catch up with, that was all, he was a loser and she didn't want anything to do with him. Now she wants to meet up and have coffee, pretty big change there? I said no, i feel uncomfortable with you doing that, when an ex messages me I don't respond or if it's asking a question I answer then that's that. It's not hard to see when other people try to get back into your life. But ofcourse, I feel like an asshole telling her she can't do something so i let her know, I feel uncomfortable but if you want to go, go. And if she did anything or I expected anything it was over. Ofcourse she calls me 25 minutes later saying how much of an asshole this guy was, and I'm like hmm it's not like you've been saying that this entire time yet you still want to go out of your way to keep talking to him? And she apologized said she was sorry, she was done with talking to him and it was over. I felt extremely relieved. about 5 months later we started talking about moving out together and I told her I would love to but our financial situations were very different. We were both 22 at the time, I was going to college full time and working during the summer and she had nursing class and her clinicals. She was blessed enough to have her parent's buy her car, pay for her schooling, and give her a $900/month allowance during school for rent and groceries. She did work very hard at school and put a lot of hours into nursing school with straight A's so she wasn't mooching at all. However, her parents were a lot older than mine and my family helped out as they could and I didn't expect them to do any of those things. I had paid for my first 3 years of school out of pocket, bought my own car, and saved money. Understanding the bills for rent, food, and utilities I told her that it wasn't going to be possible. And i wouldn't feel right just living off of her father's money, also I wasn't sure we were ready to move out together yet. She still had a lot of issues with depression and anxiety, and I wasn't sure if moving out was the right call. I helped her as much as i could and whenever her mood changed or I noticed she was feeling down I was right there to cheer her up, and most of the time it did work. When she needed space I gave it to her, I just always wanted to make sure she knew she was loved and I'd be there for her. Ironically, Miraculously, my genious brother who was 11 at the time brought up that my family's house that my great-grandmother had and we'd been too since kids was vacant since my great-grandma had been in the nursing home for a few years. The house was paid off and the bills would only be the mortgage, utilities, and cable which was more than affordable working a part time-job while going to school if we split the cost. So 1 month later we decided we would move into my family's house together. I can't explain how excited I was to move in with her. It was my great grandma and grandpa's house and there were so many memories in that house, and now we got to move into it together and start our life. I told her I'd take care of all of our stuff that needed to be move so me and my 2 good friends moved my bed, our dressers, and got the house all ready since she was at her nursing clinicals a few hours away, I was so happy to get everything ready for her when she came home and the first thing I said was, sweetheart this is our home.  My grandmother who I've always been close to decided to come over and help clean (she was 67 years old), she was such a sweetheart and wanted to help get us ready in our house. I told her she could do the bathroom mirror since it was the least bending and she wasn't leaving without helping at least a bit lol. She decided to clean the tub too and after she left it was the first moments we had together in our house. I noticed my ex had started to get a bit of an attitude/withdrawn about halfway through my grandma being there so i brought it up and asked her what was wrong and she kind of looked down and said everything was fine, I Thought she might just be anxious since we did put a lot of work into this house over the summer when we weren't working or at school, and it was a big step. Shortly after she left I asked if everything was alright, and she told me she was angry with my grandma, had refused to talk to her because my grandmother decided to clean the bathtub with the wrong bleach. Keep in mind, at no point did she ask my grandma, hey it's ok you don't need to clean the bathtub, or hey can you use a bleach, or ask me to tell my grandma, hey you don't have to clean the bathtub. And so she was upset with her and me, not voicing her opinion on why she was upset until after my grandmother left and I was pretty angry with her. My grandma has done a lot for myself and my family, as well as for my ex. She understood how much my grandmother meant to me and everything we've done for each other, and they were on very good terms there was never a bad word or argument, or bad feelings between any of them, it's extremely hard to dislike my grandmother. I told her that was pretty childish that she didn't at least ask me to tell her to stop, but rather got a mood and decided to sweep the garage for 2 hours while my grandma was there, the entire thing could've been avoided if she just told me what was wrong with her. She was very bad at communicating so I had to do the vast majority of communication during our relationship, and when we did everything was great but she would routinely get into moods like this where she wouldn't talk, did her own thing, and all I was left to do was wonder why she was upset and I couldn't do anything about it. Eventually, the ex she talked to kept getting brought up in sequence, 3 months would go by and she'd bring him up and act as if it was her best-friend and think, ""oh why are you wondering why i'm talking to him"" and living with just her and I, it felt like i was going crazy. I'd never been pushed to my limits so much with a person in my entire life, and the worse part was that she refused to see it from my point of view, or even acknowledge why her behaviour was a little bit out of the ordinary. After the 4th time I decided to break up with her, her lack of empathy and always acting so dumbfounded as to why I would be upset or question why even talk to this guy after every time she would bring him up, I'd allow it, she would come to me saying he's an asshole, I'd tell her, ""yeah the guy seems pretty weird and doesn't do anything good for your life, why even attempt to rekindle this relationship."" I was fed up with it and yet I still tried to work things out with her, but now she had ""Had enough"" of me letting her know how unhealthy and unnecessary what she was doing was for herself and for our relationship. The next day it was like a completely different person, I have never seen anything like it In my life. Even the day before the argument she'd pull me from the computer to snuggle. Every night I'd lay down with her at 9:30 to help her get to sleep, every single night for the entirety of our time dating. I enjoyed it, spending time with her and knowing she could sleep easy, that was enough of a reason for me. But the day after we broke up, she didn't look at me or acknowledge anything. With quarantine being enacted, I let her stay in the house for a month since she wouldn't be able to find a place during the lockdown and she'd have to drive home an hour and a half during her clinicals. I should've kicked her out. She didn't deserve to stay after what she'd done and the conversations she'd had behind my back with this guy. She begged me to read the messages and for the first 4 months I wouldn't why should i have to act like her father, and read the messages she's sending another person. After the 4th month I did, and there was no evidence of treating but they were talking on subject you should not talk about with an ex of your's at all, let alone when that person is in a fucking relationship. This guy was a complete loser, and she fed right into his attention just to receive more of it and it was disgusting. That last month was the hardest month of my life. Waking up with the person I thought i was going to marry sleeping in the room next to me. In the house I had my family pull many strings on just to get us in here. To have her look at me like a stranger and be completely void of feeling when one night before she was her goofy self, wanting to be held and I Loved her. That month was so extremely hard and it's sat with me through the last 6 months and has taken away so much of my energy and will-power. I haven't gone to the gym, I make excuses to not hang out with my friends who I've known since i was 4 years old and are like brothers to me. It's so hard to talk with anyone about this because I've always had my life together to be able to help the ones I care about, and now I can't and so much rides on me being strong for those around me.

All in all, it's great to get this off my chest about this whole situation. There's a lot of good parts I simply can't write all down, and although only the bad parts were here I do believe we loved each other very much, and that she loved me very much. I should've ended things much sooner than I did, but it was hard. We were practically a married couple and 95% of the time had such a good relationship but one of these events would pop up and throw me completely off. I've thought about my relationship constantly these past 6 months figuring out what needed to change to make things work. I still don't have an answer and it destroys me, certain nights i can't sleep. I still have dreams of when she would sleep next to me, and my house just feels empty without her. It's getting better, I have an amazing family but it's been extraordinarily hard to talk to people about what really happened in our relationship.",t2_8k8r29dy,False,,0,False,I had it all,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_jhngce,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603629223.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to start this, I&amp;#39;m a 23 year old man and I couldn&amp;#39;t feel more of a child than my entire life. It all started about 6 months ago when me and my girlfriend broke up. It&amp;#39;s hard to put into words and truly recreate what happened during our relationship so this post is going to be a very long one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some history of my relationships with my family and friends: I&amp;#39;ve been an integral and active part in my family since i was 14 years old. My family is amazing but this past year, especially after the breakup, I feel everything changing and i&amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;#39;s them or me. I&amp;#39;ve done so much and have had to make such hard decisions even at a young age regarding my family and dealing with them in such a way that leaves whichever mistake/situation at hand simply as that, a bad mistake/decision and showing love to my family, only ever wanting to help and fix the situation. My will-power for my entire life has been asburd, literally nothing would ever stand in my way, not forcefully either, but I always knew I was capable of achieving such great things if I put the work and effort toward them. My father is incredibly strong, but very critical. We&amp;#39;ve always had a good relationship, and my father&amp;#39;s side of the family are so strong and secure, we never let any problem get to us, we&amp;#39;d always solve it or prevent it if possible. My mother&amp;#39;s side is extremely caring, and I&amp;#39;ve had an amazing relationship with both of my grandmother&amp;#39;s, especially on my mother&amp;#39;s side. We&amp;#39;d talk all the time and go over problems, and we&amp;#39;d always help figure them out together. My mother re-married when i was 15 to her childhood friend after my parent&amp;#39;s got divorced and although my step-father has seemingly been doing better, there was a lot of shit he put not only me but my mother and little brothers through, and he knows that I&amp;#39;ll always be there to protect them. Except that&amp;#39;s the problem, with how i&amp;#39;ve been feeling lately it seems impossible to be there for my family, let alone myself. And as much as I want to talk about it, It feels impossible since I&amp;#39;ve always been the one to answer the hard questions, to help guide myself, my friends, and my family towards the right path. If i talk to them now about how hard these past few months then am i not just a hypocrite for not taking my own advice and moving forward? I&amp;#39;ve never belittled anybody for their issues but I&amp;#39;ve always focused on ways to solve them and I cannot solve this feeling inside of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When i got into my last relationship 2 years ago, i let every guard down with my girlfriend. I&amp;#39;ve been with women and have had short relationships, but this one was serious and I put everything into it. My ex-gf was incredibly intelligent and hard-working but very anxious and pretty introverted. I&amp;#39;ve always been a mix intro-extrovert, I enjoy my alone time but I&amp;#39;ve always been extremely close with my friends and love going out. Since this break-up though I have felt so depressed it is unreal. I&amp;#39;ve never felt anything like this in my life. I&amp;#39;ve excelled and am such a smart individual.But this last relationship had destroyed me. We met 1 month before school ended 2 years ago and started seeing each other. She lived 1.5 hours away from our university so she would go home when summer started. I started to feel pretty connected to this girl and she certainly cared about me. After a lot of hard thinking we decided to continue dating throughout summer and try to make things work, That summer I worked 8-5 in a family friend&amp;#39;s detailing garage as a summer job, went to the gym each day after work, and every friday after work I&amp;#39;d make the hour and a half drive down to see this girl and be with her family,she would drive down as well, we kept it pretty even but i definitely did more driving which was alright by me, she was working a lot of hours and had to drive a lot so i didn&amp;#39;t mind making a few extra trips. on some occasions I&amp;#39;d even stay sunday night if she wasn&amp;#39;t feeling well or was anxious/wanting to talk and leave her house at 5:30am on Monday to make it to work, and I had no issues doing that since i knew how much it meant to her. I really started to fall for this girl. After our 2nd month in summer before we decided to make things serious we were talking on the phone and she asked me about being serious with our relationship and having our family&amp;#39;s meet, we had agreed we would not see anybody else and we were still enjoying each other and figuring out how well we got together. And that night I told her I&amp;#39;d think about it and let her know tommorrow, it was a big decision and I was leaning towards yes but I understood the amount of love and commitment that goes into a healthy relationship and I wanted to make sure I was signing up for that and able to be that for her. When I woke up I was in pure bliss, I knew how much this girl loved me and I loved her too, and I admitted that to myself and I wanted to be with her. Her first text that morning was her saying sorry about what happened. After I asked, she told me that she had gone to her friend&amp;#39;s house and they had done some things( not all the way) but damn well more than enough of what is even remotely ok. I was so caught off. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it, It had been not but 2 hours since she was professing her love for me that night, and me wanting to make sure I made the right decision she took it as I was breaking up with her and immediately flocked to get her condolence from a weird ass guy. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it. With any other person in my life I would&amp;#39;ve been done, without a question. It tore me apart. Her birthday was coming up that weekend and I had gotten her a gift bag with roses and a candle and a lot of her favorite lotions she&amp;#39;d always talk about and I was so happy to give it to her. I told her I needed some time and she began crying hysterically. I didn&amp;#39;t talk to her much but decided to come down for her birthday. I hadn&amp;#39;t decided whether it was going to be to break-up with her or to see what happened, there were multiple times during the drive I just thought fuck it I&amp;#39;ll turn around she messed up and she knows exactly what she did, but for some reason I t was like a posession to keep driving down. When i got there we went downstairs and she was crying, begging me on her knees that I would stay, she had written a 2 page letter to me saying how much I&amp;#39;d done for her and how she wanted to die after what happened. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it, it was the hardest decision in my life, but I thought she meant what she said and I decided to give her another chance. I&amp;#39;m not a controlling person but as you&amp;#39;d imagine I lost all trust in her, she had a few guy friends in her nursing class that I met and were good guys that I trusted but a few i hadn&amp;#39;t met. And i told her, I do not feel comfortable anymore with you talking to these guy-friends I haven&amp;#39;t met. I felt like shit saying it, i know what it looks like and I know what it is. No person should have to limit their partner, or anyone on who they can keep in contact with. But I was so done at that point that was the only way I would stay, and if i got to meet them and see how they were that&amp;#39;d be a different story. I felt like complete shit even saying that but it was the only way I could trust her. I hadn&amp;#39;t even heard of the guy that she went over to his house. But she agreed, and we worked things out together for the most part. We dated throughout summer and slowly the trust started to come back and I was still madly in love with this girl which is why it was so hard. At 21 we practically moved in together when school started. We&amp;#39;d stay at my mom&amp;#39;s house for a week together, pack our things, and then go stay in her dorm together for a week.

After the 4th time I decided to break up with her, her lack of empathy and always acting so dumbfounded as to why I would be upset or question why even talk to this guy after every time she would bring him up, I&amp;#39;d allow it, she would come to me saying he&amp;#39;s an asshole, I&amp;#39;d tell her, &amp;quot;yeah the guy seems pretty weird and doesn&amp;#39;t do anything good for your life, why even attempt to rekindle this relationship.&amp;quot; I was fed up with it and yet I still tried to work things out with her, but now she had &amp;quot;Had enough&amp;quot; of me letting her know how unhealthy and unnecessary what she was doing was for herself and for our relationship. The next day it was like a completely different person, I have never seen anything like it In my life. Even the day before the argument she&amp;#39;d pull me from the computer to snuggle. Every night I&amp;#39;d lay down with her at 9:30 to help her get to sleep, every single night for the entirety of our time dating. I enjoyed it, spending time with her and knowing she could sleep easy, that was enough of a reason for me. But the day after we broke up, she didn&amp;#39;t look at me or acknowledge anything. With quarantine being enacted, I let her stay in the house for a month since she wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to find a place during the lockdown and she&amp;#39;d have to drive home an hour and a half during her clinicals. I should&amp;#39;ve kicked her out. She didn&amp;#39;t deserve to stay after what she&amp;#39;d done and the conversations she&amp;#39;d had behind my back with this guy. She begged me to read the messages and for the first 4 months I wouldn&amp;#39;t why should i have to act like her father, and read the messages she&amp;#39;s sending another person. After the 4th month I did, and there was no evidence of treating but they were talking on subject you should not talk about with an ex of your&amp;#39;s at all, let alone when that person is in a fucking relationship. This guy was a complete loser, and she fed right into his attention just to receive more of it and it was disgusting. That last month was the hardest month of my life. Waking up with the person I thought i was going to marry sleeping in the room next to me. In the house I had my family pull many strings on just to get us in here. To have her look at me like a stranger and be completely void of feeling when one night before she was her goofy self, wanting to be held and I Loved her. That month was so extremely hard and it&amp;#39;s sat with me through the last 6 months and has taken away so much of my energy and will-power. I haven&amp;#39;t gone to the gym, I make excuses to not hang out with my friends who I&amp;#39;ve known since i was 4 years old and are like brothers to me. It&amp;#39;s so hard to talk with anyone about this because I&amp;#39;ve always had my life together to be able to help the ones I care about, and now I can&amp;#39;t and so much rides on me being strong for those around me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, it&amp;#39;s great to get this off my chest about this whole situation. There&amp;#39;s a lot of good parts I simply can&amp;#39;t write all down, and although only the bad parts were here I do believe we loved each other very much, and that she loved me very much. I should&amp;#39;ve ended things much sooner than I did, but it was hard. We were practically a married couple and 95% of the time had such a good relationship but one of these events would pop up and throw me completely off. I&amp;#39;ve thought about my relationship constantly these past 6 months figuring out what needed to change to make things work. I still don&amp;#39;t have an answer and it destroys me, certain nights i can&amp;#39;t sleep. I still have dreams of when she would sleep next to me, and my house just feels empty without her. It&amp;#39;s getting better, I have an amazing family but it&amp;#39;s been extraordinarily hard to talk to people about what really happened in our relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

My father walked away when I was 6 and my mother was emotionally unavailable, giving me Ritalin and sleep meds to curb whatever issues I had when I was younger rather than taking care of me. This led to issues during key development stages during adolescence and what I reckon is I learned to suppress emotions rather than feel them in order to minimize suffering.

I've already tried a few regimens for depression and anxiety, which was what all doctors went for. I've tried a few SSRIs already for months at a time, but never felt they made any difference in helping me feel... I don't know, a litte bit more alive.

I have also tried talk therapy on and off with different therapists and approaches and unfortunately found no solace in it. I could go on and on about my life but never come into contact with my issues at the more visceral level needed for healing.

About a year ago I moved to a new city (my gf at the time was here, along with a few friends and my sister). I was feeling depressed around the beginning of 2020 and have noticed it progressively getting worse. I really don't know how to phrase it all so I'm just going to make tabs about what I notice about myself 

- I constantly find myself not keeping my things clean. I used to be real bad at this, but I was doing really well until about 2 mo ago. Now I don't care and it stresses me out seeing how dirty my house is, but I'm too tired/unmotivated to do anything about it
- My job/work environment has not been good the last 4-5 mo. I used to love my job, but once coworkers got shuffled around it all changed. I had a new manager that was horrible (and was recently let go) that made my job 10x harder with more work. Our parent company does not keep our business afloat financially and essentially wants us to fix problems/maintain good customer service without paying to fix things. Recently they've claimed they're going to start, but I haven't seen it. 
- Maryjane has gone from here and there a couple times a week to almost daily sometimes more than once a day. I feel like I think about everything and everyone all the time and it slows my brain down
- I don't have many friends in the city and I feel like Im bothering them when I ask to hang out more than here or there. We all have lives and aside for my sister these are all people I've really only spent on and off hanging out with for a year. I've never felt like I've bugged people before and am afraid I will. I have many friends in other cities, the most being my hometown and it makes me wonder if I should move back. 
- I'm trying to figure out where I'm at in life. I have friends getting engaged and I ended a serious relationship. I would love to be married with a kid on the way in 3-6 years, which is a large window, but it's hard to envision. I mean heck I'll even pay psychics $2-$5 for questions about it.

Recently they&amp;#39;ve claimed they&amp;#39;re going to start, but I haven&amp;#39;t seen it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maryjane has gone from here and there a couple times a week to almost daily sometimes more than once a day. I feel like I think about everything and everyone all the time and it slows my brain down&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have many friends in the city and I feel like Im bothering them when I ask to hang out more than here or there. We all have lives and aside for my sister these are all people I&amp;#39;ve really only spent on and off hanging out with for a year. I&amp;#39;ve never felt like I&amp;#39;ve bugged people before and am afraid I will. I have many friends in other cities, the most being my hometown and it makes me wonder if I should move back. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out where I&amp;#39;m at in life. I have friends getting engaged and I ended a serious relationship. I would love to be married with a kid on the way in 3-6 years, which is a large window, but it&amp;#39;s hard to envision. I mean heck I&amp;#39;ll even pay psychics $2-$5 for questions about it. I always get different answers, but I guess I was looking for something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what I was wanting to get out of this post, but thank you for taking the time to read it and if you have any advice or even where to get started I&amp;#39;m all ears.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I hate that it's considered irrational for someone who has battled mental health issues as long as I have to want to stop suffering and peacefully end my life. I'm so impossibly tired. The death with dignity act in my state would be so perfect for where I am now if it was expanded to include those battling lifelong mental illness. I understand why people are wary about the ways in which such a thing involving an already vulnerable group could be exploited. I hate how demented and entitled I come across as for wanting to burden others with something as heavy as helping me end my own life.

Somehow, it just feels really important to me to be able to transition peacefully. I hate the idea of being 'found'. Trauma and mental illness have stripped me of so much dignity in life. I just wish that, at the very least, I could have a death that acknowledges my humanity in a way the majority of what I've been subjected to in life has not. I'm agnostic and generally have no clue what to make of the whys and hows of how we all ended up here. I only know that I'm terrified of ending up just as tortured in the afterlife as I am here and now. I just want peace and rest.

I've obviously been streaming way too many episodes of The Ghost Whisperer. =P

I  don't know. I just needed to vent. I wish I could talk candidly about this with professionals without dishonesty, gaslighting, and the threat of hospitalization coming into play.

But I also cry my eyes out so often as of late and can't help but feel angry and even hurt at the expectation that I continue to stay stuck in this  indefinitely.

,depression,"Depressed and anxious

I am new to reddit — I’ve been browsing around for a while now, but I’ve lacked the courage to post anything. I can relate to a lot of what has been posted, and I now feel like it’s time that I share my story:

I grew up in a chaotic household (like I’m sure a lot of you have): my mother was mentally unstable given my father lacked a steady income and was constantly finding and experimenting with entrepreneurial projects that failed to provide our family with any steady source of income. My most vivid memories (when I can actually remember, which is difficult when you have MDD) are my parents fighting constantly about mortgage payments, infidelity on business trips, and lack of extended family support. My parents divorced when I was 12 — I I lived in multiple houses growing up with my mom, and my dad has been in and out of my life ever since, though he’s been more involved these past couple of years (I actually lived on his couch from 25 to 26).

However, fortunately, I was able to push through (or ignore)a lot of these family problems growing up, though I was still considered weird by a lot of people my age. I was an excellent high school student: I graduated with a 4.2 gpa and played two sports in which I was a captain for one them senior year. I went on to an elite private college on the east coast in which I played a varsity sport for 4 years. I had an amazing gf who I loved very much (we were together for 4 years in college, and one year after). I was confident and genuinely believed in myself: I didn’t have a fake belief in myself, but a deep love and care for myself. I graduated with a solid gpa as well as a couple of awards for both sports and academics.

After I graduated, my life spiraled out of control: I became deeply, deeply depressed and started to hate my self, a hatred so deep words cannot describe how I felt. I was stuck at a job that meant nothing to me, and spent my weekends indulging in alcohol and marijuana (my brain doesn’t react well to either of those substances). Each day I started to feel more and more “out of it”, emotionally numb, and dysphoric: I felt nothing, there was nothing to live for, and I stopped enjoying everything that used to bring me meaning and joy. I quit my job after 7 months, and I moved back home, leaving behind everything that I worked hard for: a job, friends that respected me, and a loving gf. 

After moving back, I was EXTREMELY heart broken after leaving my ex: I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t able to be the rock and support system for her anymore, I couldn’t understand why I felt so emotionally numb, and I couldn’t understand why there wasn’t any intimacy or passion in the sex or relationship anymore. I started to question my entire existence and identity, and I fell into the darkest depression a person could fall into: I literally questioned everything — I didn’t know my name, my gender, where I was born, my sexual orientation. Nothing felt real — I couldn’t tell real memories from fake memories. I had no sense of self which was slowly destroying me. 

Fast forward a year - I was living at home, unemployed and miserable. I ended up taking the GRE and applied to a graduate program at an Ivy League school. Got in, did that, but I still hated my self the whole time (depression, dysphoria, anxiety) it was just that I was able to hide it and distract myself in academics.

After getting my grad degree, I moved home, and I failed to keep in contact with everyone I met in school. Again, the cycle continued: depressed, dysphoric, unemployed, anxious, living at home, and lonely. I couldn’t figure out how to hold on to a job or even find one; I just wanted to go back to school again for the third time, take out more loans, and become further in debt. I stopped caring completely, about everything.

I started to watch porn, have sex with random girls to boost my self esteem (it never did) and drink heavily, and I also got into COCAINE, which completely destroyed me: I felt worthless and lost before, oh boy did cocaine just absolutely fuck me up. My delusions and dysphoria started to worsen: my life goal was to become a cocaine dealer in Mexico (started looking at plane tickets) or a lady boy in Thailand. My entire sex drive was in ruins: I had nothing solid to hold onto, again, a very fragile self image around who I was as human being with very intense dysphoria. For example, I would have repeated videos in my brain of being raped over and over again: I genuinely believed I was a victim of childhood rape, but there is no evidence of that. I went on a cocaine and alcohol binge one night, and the only thing I remember is the next morning being driven to the emergency room: I had gotten the shit beat out of me at the bar, been handcuffed  by the cops, driven home by them, and started threatening to kill myself as well as my entire family. At the emergency room, I had an insanely high blood alcohol content as well as cocaine in my system (even the day after). I talked to the social worker/psychologist there, and he determined that I was suicidal and delusional, so he put me in the schizophrenic unit of the psych ward for three days, but after the first day I was moved to the major depression and anxiety unit as they believed that was a better fit. 

I got out after 4 or 5 days, and I went to see a mental health professional voluntarily for the first time since I was a child: I saw a psychologist when I was young, but that was it. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic features, and I was prescribed Abilify and Lexapro. I had been taking both for about a year and a half; however, I went cold turkey on the Lexapro two or three weeks ago and tapered off the Abilify myself a month and a half ago: I just couldn’t stand the weight gain ( I probably gained 50 lbs) and it really didn’t make me feel at peace with myself, it was a bandaid, and I genuinely knew that from the bottom of my heart.

Moved back to the Ivy League town where I graduated from, and I was able to find a job doing consulting work (think about one of those jobs that only rich connected people get); but I quit after 8 months because I wanted to become a professional poker player. I moved to Las Vegas, got an apartment, and started playing at the casinos. Covid happened, I lost my money, and moved back home again. Again, cycle repeats itself. 

I recently found a job in another state doing bullshit office work: think Dilbert or Office Space. But, I have come to terms with it, and I’m doing my best to find joy in the little things. I have completely quit alcohol: it’s not even an option. I’m done with it, forever. Drugs and alcohol absolutely crush me. 

I still have intense bouts of crippling depression and anxiety attacks which I’ve come to realize are fueled by my inability to understand who I am or hold onto any sort of solid self image of myself at the deepest level: this prevents me from seeking out genuine relationships with other people, whether that be friends or a significant other. I am still questioning all aspects of my self: Am I straight or gay? Am I male or female? Where am I from? What is my name? Who are my family members? Memories don’t seem real, nothing seems real anymore. It’s wearing me down, and I can’t imagine that a person could go through so much pain and still exist. It’s a miracle.

I’m seeing a new psychiatrist, and I am hopeful he will help. I’ve been stable before, relatively content and at peace with myself; I am hoping to get back to that place again. I can’t give up.

,depression,"All of my friends told me I should move out of my parent's and get an apartment. My old place was very gross and not taken care of, inconveniently located, and I lived with my abusive dad. It seems like getting a place that I can take care of myself would be a good idea right? 

Well I've been here for a while now and I've completely backslid. I'm getting drunk every night, smoking cigarettes like crazy, binge eating. Im spending my money unwisely and I cant stop myself. It's like I'm addicted to things that are bad for me because I want to die so bad that they temporarily distract me. I've been really sick with this infection that keeps coming and going and I haven't been going to see the doctor. I'm procrastinating my school work and the stress is constant. As soon as I do finish work theres just more of it and this makes me think about how that's simply what life is and then I break down and cry because honestly I dont enjoy anything but drugs and food in this life. 

I've given up on my hobbies because they aren't fun anymore. Theres nothing new to do because of covid.

And then I go to a friends house and we were just chilling and I felt like I needed to get weight off my chest. So I decided to tell my crush that I liked her. So I asked her out and she leaves me on read for like 15 mins and then starts typing. She typed that she didn’t like me that way and she just thought of me as a friend.

He also makes lies to other people about beating me and my friends up all by himself even though we would beat the shit outta him and that kinda thing.

,depression,"I've been horribly depressed since graduation in may 2018. broke up with my gf of 2 years at the time. got a shit job right after college in the middle of nowhere. During that time, still depressed about the break up have been feeling nothing but regret of missing out on a lot of college experiences : Rushing a fraternity, new friendships, social/Greek events, wild fraternity parties where hundreds of random girls show up, and dancing and getting laid with women. 

I quit my shitty job after 3 months moved back with my parents. Became a stoner to suppress the sadness. Didn't try out on dates. Became more anxious and insecure about my sex life and body count. Got a good job in november'18 and thought it would be smart to live with them for a year to save up and potentially buy a house. Job turned me into bit of a workaholic and was still a stoner. Was not having fun and when i did was not enjoying it. Depressed and saw a therapist for a bit then stopped when it became 2020. Pandemic hasn't been helping because has put things I wanna do to make up for what i missed on delay.

I've felt extremely depressed since May. Was smoking even more with WFH and not even enjoying it anymore. Made me so anxious. Stopping briefly also made me anxious because I thought about how much time I've wasted being a stoner.

It is now October. I am 24yo and in Jan will be 25.  I have not smoked for about 2 months. However : My job has been shit the last few months. I'm seeing a therapist again. Psychiatrist diagnosed me with depression (again) and add. On heavy meds. Still living with my parents. Haven't been looking for a house because thinking of looking for another job. Haven't looked for another job because work has been burning me out. Started dating again however about 4 weeks ago (before meds) I suddenly lost my libido and all arousal. I don't get aroused looking at girls or feel horney anymore. A girl came over to my place. First time in 18 months i was going to have sex and i can't get an erection. fml. just my luck and what depressed guy needs right? Don't even want to go on dating apps currently because I feel no arousal still. I am trying to get my body count up because of insecurity and this happens. More fucking delay. 

Now I've cycled back into looking at peoples Instagram's for hours and looking at like TFM insta pages and collegesluts subreddit just thinking of how much I've missed out on. How naïve i was when i was younger. Wishing i had rushed. Wishing i did all these things i mentioned earlier before getting into a happy relationship in junior year. I think how all my friends from high school i still hang out with were in frats. 3 of them were engineers as well and they were in frats and boy did they have fun.

I was so naïve to not rush. I thought ""I had enough friends and partied enough in high school"" boy was i wrong and it didn't even compare. Everyone i went to high school with went to the same instate college as me and joined Greek life. And boy were the parties more than i ever expected to be and i will never get to experience that. I wish I could've been to just one. All i can do is imagine the events/girls that go on inside those fraternity houses. 

And now i am typing out something maybe 1-2 strangers will see pitying myself and making myself feel down and not in the mood to look for jobs because i want to cry right now. I don't want to die, but hard not to give up and do things and enjoy things and look forward. I keep looking back and can't seem to stop from doing it.

&lt;p&gt;I quit my shitty job after 3 months moved back with my parents. Became a stoner to suppress the sadness. Didn&amp;#39;t try out on dates. Became more anxious and insecure about my sex life and body count. Got a good job in november&amp;#39;18 and thought it would be smart to live with them for a year to save up and potentially buy a house. Job turned me into bit of a workaholic and was still a stoner. Was not having fun and when i did was not enjoying it. Depressed and saw a therapist for a bit then stopped when it became 2020. Pandemic hasn&amp;#39;t been helping because has put things I wanna do to make up for what i missed on delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve felt extremely depressed since May. Was smoking even more with WFH and not even enjoying it anymore. Made me so anxious. Stopping briefly also made me anxious because I thought about how much time I&amp;#39;ve wasted being a stoner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is now October. I am 24yo and in Jan will be 25.  I have not smoked for about 2 months. However : My job has been shit the last few months. I&amp;#39;m seeing a therapist again. Psychiatrist diagnosed me with depression (again) and add. On heavy meds. Still living with my parents. Haven&amp;#39;t been looking for a house because thinking of looking for another job. Haven&amp;#39;t looked for another job because work has been burning me out. Started dating again however about 4 weeks ago (before meds) I suddenly lost my libido and all arousal. I don&amp;#39;t get aroused looking at girls or feel horney anymore. A girl came over to my place. First time in 18 months i was going to have sex and i can&amp;#39;t get an erection. fml. just my luck and what depressed guy needs right? Don&amp;#39;t even want to go on dating apps currently because I feel no arousal still. I am trying to get my body count up because of insecurity and this happens. More fucking delay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;ve cycled back into looking at peoples Instagram&amp;#39;s for hours and looking at like TFM insta pages and collegesluts subreddit just thinking of how much I&amp;#39;ve missed out on. How naïve i was when i was younger. Wishing i had rushed. Wishing i did all these things i mentioned earlier before getting into a happy relationship in junior year. I think how all my friends from high school i still hang out with were in frats. 3 of them were engineers as well and they were in frats and boy did they have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so naïve to not rush. I thought &amp;quot;I had enough friends and partied enough in high school&amp;quot; boy was i wrong and it didn&amp;#39;t even compare. Everyone i went to high school with went to the same instate college as me and joined Greek life. And boy were the parties more than i ever expected to be and i will never get to experience that. I wish I could&amp;#39;ve been to just one. All i can do is imagine the events/girls that go on inside those fraternity houses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now i am typing out something maybe 1-2 strangers will see pitying myself and making myself feel down and not in the mood to look for jobs because i want to cry right now. I don&amp;#39;t want to die, but hard not to give up and do things and enjoy things and look forward. I keep looking back and can&amp;#39;t seem to stop from doing it. I know those opportunities I&amp;#39;m talking about are long past my time and I accept that but its sad to accept it.&lt;/p&gt;

On the way home, I thought about how lonely I was and how I'll never have a family, never get married or do the things Ive always wanted to do in life. Because I'm hideous, useless and I will not EVER not think these things about myself.

Like music. I always wanted to be a musician but my mother tells me today that I turned down her attempts to get me into music. I honestly can say that I do not remember her being receptive to me wanting to play music because she wanted me to do something that guranteed me a good living. This makes me hate myself more. Why the fuck would I say no to learning instruments??? I did not believe her at first but she would not lie to me about that. So, yeah. I'm an idiot. I'm getting a masters in IT but I do not even really care because I wish I were a musician. But i have no talent in music and I'm 28 years old. So I feel like my life is a wasted one. This is why I hate female singers like Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Beyoncé, etc. I feel that most of the accolades they recieve is undeserved and that I should be up there. It is very depressing and annoying.

She also can not wrap her head around the fact that when I look in the mirror, I'm absolutely dusgusted at what I see. I LOATHE my appearance and always have. And apparently, everyone else did to. I was called ""ugly"" constantly by classmates and family. She can not even fathom why in the world I would think that. Of course she says I'm pretty. I'm her daughter. 

I am a waste of life. If I could give my life for someone who died prematurely, I would do it, no questions asked, no second thoughts.

I'm 28, single, very very ugly with a soft cervix (I had a miscarriage because of this years ago).

My mom constantly tells me that she is confident that I will have a family but I jist have seen way too many women want children but never have them.

I am not significant. I do not enrich anyone's life. I'm just a loser with too much self-awareness. I hate everything about myself. Everything.

Anyone I talk to just does not understand where I'm coming from. They question why I'm even depressed. But you would be depressed to if the main thing you ever wanted just is not meant to be. 

I just want to fucking jump off a cliff.

,depression,"I was diagnosed with depression two years ago, I’m 14 and it was because of some issues with my mum. She’s given me severe trauma, and even nightmares. I’ve been living with my grandparents while she gets her shit together. Whilst living here, I’ve felt genuine happiness. This is the place I grew up in. My mum would drop me off and go party or something. My safe space. Recently, it doesn’t feel like that anymore. I’ve always had issues with sleeping, and they’ve acknowledged that. I don’t have friends to talk to in real life, I’m homeschooled so it makes it really difficult to make friends. I’ve always talked to people online. I’ve been clean for 4 months until a few days ago. I was up at like 4 am, talking to friends, since it was a weekend. My grandmother woke up and came in my room. I knew I shouldn’t have been up so I sat there and just listened. It was all fine until she said this: “You’re just as responsible as your mother.” I Instantly got the feeling again and just went mad. She keeps mocking me now. Mumbling to herself about how I’m useless. I told my grandad that when she yells it reminds me of my mum and that’s why I get emotional. I guess he told her and she got pissed. Now i feel like I can’t open up to anyone. I need to vent. So desperately. I don’t want to bother my friends with shit they don’t care about. Someone simply asking me if I’m okay, or how I’m doing, makes me want to ball my eyes out. I ruin everything for myself. I can be given a simple thing to do, like clean my room, and I won’t do it. Even if I want to, I won’t. I’m lazy, useless and wasting people’s time. I don’t want to die. I just want to stop being a bother all the time. I don’t know how to escape this anymore.

She’s given me severe trauma, and even nightmares. I’ve been living with my grandparents while she gets her shit together. Whilst living here, I’ve felt genuine happiness. This is the place I grew up in. My mum would drop me off and go party or something. My safe space. Recently, it doesn’t feel like that anymore. I’ve always had issues with sleeping, and they’ve acknowledged that. I don’t have friends to talk to in real life, I’m homeschooled so it makes it really difficult to make friends. I’ve always talked to people online. I’ve been clean for 4 months until a few days ago. I was up at like 4 am, talking to friends, since it was a weekend. My grandmother woke up and came in my room. I knew I shouldn’t have been up so I sat there and just listened. It was all fine until she said this: “You’re just as responsible as your mother.” I Instantly got the feeling again and just went mad. She keeps mocking me now. Mumbling to herself about how I’m useless. I told my grandad that when she yells it reminds me of my mum and that’s why I get emotional. I guess he told her and she got pissed. Now i feel like I can’t open up to anyone. I need to vent. So desperately. I don’t want to bother my friends with shit they don’t care about. Someone simply asking me if I’m okay, or how I’m doing, makes me want to ball my eyes out. I ruin everything for myself. I can be given a simple thing to do, like clean my room, and I won’t do it. Even if I want to, I won’t. I’m lazy, useless and wasting people’s time. I don’t want to die. I just want to stop being a bother all the time. I don’t know how to escape this anymore. I’m still a kid, I don’t know what the hell im gonna do if I’m an adult. I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi there folks!

Like the title says, I really could need some advice from you regarding the relationship with my depressed best friend. I suffered from depression for several years myself, so it's not like I'm clueless on this matter, but still, I'm slowly reaching my limits.

Even though, it's not certain that he suffers from depression, since he absolutely refuses to visit any kind of therapist and doesn't have a diagnosis, I personally believe that his symptoms are quite clear. It wasn't always as bad as today, but now most of the time he is either sad, bitter, grumpy, feeling hopeless or getting hurt so easily that I sometimes don't even know what I should say to him, as I feel like I'm walking on eggshells. 

He's a convinced pessimist and has an extreme negative view of the world and himself. Basically, he always talking himself down, going on about how useless he is, that he doesn't have any talents or positive qualities, how he doesn't understand why I would want to have him as my best friend or how unhappy he is with almost every aspect of his life. 

Still, he doesn't do anything about it and also refused any help from others. Whenever I try to come up with solutions for him, he doesn't even consider them, but instatly starts looking for excuses in order to not even try - even when these excuses often are complete nonsense. He's probably trying to protect himself from the potential dissappointment of these solutions not working, but apparently doesn't realize that he's just setting himself up for even more dissapoinments and suffering.

But guess what? I still love him and not a single one of these things will change that he's still my best friend and that naturally I want to help him. But that's excactly the issue: he refuses any help. Even though he often complains about being unhappy and even though he has a childhood diagnosis for adhd and is suspecting himself that he also might have bipolar disorder, he doesn't seem to even care about getting any professional help. 

But it's not only about professional help. Recently, he also began stonewalling, whenever I try to help him. I don't believe he's doing that on purpose, but rather that he doesn't even acknowlegde his own feelings himself. He always had issues with showing any sign ""weakness"" and admiting his own mistakes. So, even if he's obviously upset, angry or hurt, he will absolutely deny it. Personally, I think that's his most serious issue right now, since it ruins any chance of improvement.

He is a very emotional, sometimes even upright irrational, person. For him, the world he sees through the lens of his own emotions is the only real one and he is either not able or not willing to try and understand the views and feelings of other people. 

Also, even though he defenitely has issues with his self-image and confidence, paradoxically he still is a very prideful person. On one hand, he's full of self-hate and self-pity and on the other hand  he likes to boast a lot and will fight anyone who is even only slightly cricitcizing him. This mix of pride and emotionality often leads to him feeling extremely hurt by and resentful  towards others, even when the only thing they did was disagreeing with him. 

On top of that, it also makes him inaccessible to any rational arguments, since he only listens to his own emotions. This one is so extreme, he doesn't even change his mind when confronted with facts, stone-cold evidence or when basically EVERYONE is disagreeing with him. There's absolute no approach  to make him rethink and eventually admit when he's wrong - neither being compassionate and understanding nor getting angry with him or proving him wrong on a rational level.

Naturally, at this point our relationship is starting to take its toll on me. I'm still commited to this friendship and I really don't want to give up on it, but I'm afraid that his behaviour is slowly destroying our bond of trust. As it is now, I'm always the one having to make compromises. When we fight, I'm the one who has to apologize. He seldom goes out of his way and tries to be considerate of MY views and emotions, he never tries to put himself in my shoes, even though I always try to understand HIM. He doesn't support me on an emotional level anymore, while I still do it for him nonetheless, and recently he even started blaming me and others for things that are actually his own responsibility.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to pierce through his stonewalling? How can I convice him to accept help and stop wallowing in self-pity for the remainder of his life, when he doesn't even listen to rational arguments?

,depression,"The title says it all. 

Now that I think about it, it's no wonder why I always complain and ask people if they want to play video games with me. I want some positive attention—I want someone to make me laugh and help me get through my school years. 

My best friend, let's call her Kacy, hasn't messaged me in almost three years, and I remember crying because she no longer wanted to hang out with me. It was pretty pathetic, to be honest, but it's hard to describe the loss I felt. I lost my only friend, the girl I played Minecraft for eight+ hours with on the weekend, and she also shared almost all of my interests. It was like we were made for each other.  

I always forgave her for lying and using me because I loved her. Not romantically, but as a sister. I felt happy whenever she messaged me and sad when we had to sleep because we had school in the morning. 

I have friends. I hang out with them at school, but that's where it stays. Once I leave that building, we don't talk until we're back in that building. Is that normal? Is it normal to not hang out with your friends?

I don't know, but my mom said it isn't. I think I'm touch starved, too. My mom and dad are not all touchy-feely; my dad less so than my mom so that I can go weeks without any physical contact.

,depression,"Hey, just wanted to vent here about something that I’ve been struggling with for so long but no one seems to understand. I’m not exactly an antisocial person, I have friends but I live in a very rural area where I can’t walk or bike to friends houses and don’t have a license either so I can’t do much. I watch anime sometimes and some shows that depict the typical “high school life” walking to and from school and around a small town or a city or something with drama and whatever always seemed so appealing to me, and as a senior I feel like I missed out on so much and it really sucks.

,depression,"Hello reddit,

full disclosure: 

1. I'm not the affected person, I'm here to better understand my girlfriend in order to help her.
2. For privacy reasons, this is not my main account. I'm not in a position to decide which of our friends should know about the situation and my primary account is very well known unfortunately.

Back to topic. My girlfriend of two years has been diagnosed with depression many years ago. Without going into detail too much at this point I would like to help her with one of the most difficult times she has. Being alone.  
Due to our schedules there are times at which she has to be alone for a few hours or sometimes a few days. Due to our respective jobs this is unavoidable. 

Unfortunately, being alone is absolutely unbearable for her. It renders her completely numb up to a point at which she doesn't even have the energy to get up in the morning or leave her couch. If I am away for a few days she manages the first day, sometimes the second day but at the third everything falls apart and she calls in sick at work, doesn't respond to calls, is unable to take care of her pets as well as herself. At times it renders her completely immobile. Since at this point I am usually far away I want to help her in order to prevent or at least delay this.

Something I noticed is that she tends to watch movies when she cannot find the energy to get up from the couch but this has a caveat. Her entire situation worsens drastically or improves slightly, depending on the movie. This is why my first idea is to get her a selection of ""safe"" movies to watch that I know would take her mind of for a while and hopefully give her the chance to recover. Unfortunately I don't know how I could find acceptable movies. As of right now the two most effective are ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" as well as ""Zootopia"". She absolutely adores animals and spending time with them or even just watching them relaxes her a lot. Because of this, movies in which animals are abused or killed are an absolute taboo, as well as obviously everything that reminds her of her own situation. Could you recommend more movies that would fit into this category of ""feel good"" movies? Preferably with real actors and animals, Zootopia is so far the only animated movies she enjoyed. 

The only other thing I can think of that really helps her are real animals but her pets are not always in the mood to get pets and without the energy to get up, she wouldn't go outside.

I would really appreciate if you could recommend more movies I could get her for her library or if you could give my any other tips how to handle such a situation when I am physically out of reach. 

It is very difficult for me to fully grasp how she feels because in many aspects, I'm the exact opposite. Please keep that in mind when my descriptions of her situations seem vague. 

I'm trying to help her and be supportive but without understanding her situation that is very difficult.

for me life is just passively waiting for the day when being trapped in this half-alive state finally turns into being non-alive

,depression,"My care coordinator (who has been pretty much doing a therapist's job with me for the last six months) is moving to another job. I'm devastated. I had just dropped out of uni after a suicide attempt due to abuse at uni, and the loss of my father and my gf, and was in a terrible place all summer, I've been so alone, in a big empty void for so long. Then we started to connect and i was really starting to work through stuff, and it finally felt like I had someone with me in all the darkness. Now he's being moved to another place and i have less than two weeks left with him. Since I found out, ive been unable to do my studying, just been crying in bed, unable to get up. 


I know this happens with therapy, youre supposed to have a relationship so that trust happens and you can be open so the therapy can work. But it's so painful when they leave. It happened with the uni counseller - when i dropped out, i felt like i was 'yearning' (for lack of a non weird word) for him for months. I know that in therapy you don't meet the real person, just their 'work' persona who has unconditional acceptance, but I dont know how to cope without that.

It feels like when you're a child and your best friend moves away. I feel so ridiculously sad, it's like another mini bereavement. 
I'd never been clingy or easily attached before i was bereaved last year.

I&amp;#39;m devastated. I had just dropped out of uni after a suicide attempt due to abuse at uni, and the loss of my father and my gf, and was in a terrible place all summer, I&amp;#39;ve been so alone, in a big empty void for so long. Then we started to connect and i was really starting to work through stuff, and it finally felt like I had someone with me in all the darkness. Now he&amp;#39;s being moved to another place and i have less than two weeks left with him. Since I found out, ive been unable to do my studying, just been crying in bed, unable to get up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this happens with therapy, youre supposed to have a relationship so that trust happens and you can be open so the therapy can work. But it&amp;#39;s so painful when they leave.

,depression,"Here's my sad story out in the open. 

In Mid 20s. Have a very small friend circle, which is diminishing even more. Why? Because I have social anxiety. Always under the fear that people are silently judging me and hate having me around. Mind numbs down when have to interact more than 3 folks. Always been like this, so I'm the silent guy and people probably think of me as dumb.
At a wider circle, probably 6 people I could call as friends. Used to think I had a lot more (but people start showing their true colors sooner or later) Of six mentioned above, probably two or at max three who I believe really care about me, rest just hang around for the sake of it. Like always only one of these cared enough to wish me on my birthday. It's as if in every social connect, I have to put in more effort than the counterparty. Maybe I am that worthless!
Graduated with okayish acads, have decent qualifications. Yet somehow fate plays a cruel game on me and I'm stuck in a shitty role, at a pay lesser than 30% of what someone of my calibre would earn. Even pay doesn't matter, inspite of having requisite certifications I'm not able to get into a role I desire whereas people half my credentials are warming up there. Just because I don't have 'contacts'. Pains me on a daily basis.
Had a dynamic turn of events three years back (financial downturn, loss of a close family member, and much more). Life's been shit ever since then. Probably the time when my mental health started deteriorating. Haunts me down till date (thoughts of giving up swindle across my hind almost every other night)
No hobbies, since devoted most of my time for acads (which I truly repent now). Used to love programming once but now my depressed mind just wants to stay idle during the weekend.

Not remotely attractive and a body so slim that I could be the poster boy for a malnourished kid at Africa. So should not be a surprise when I say I never had a relationship/date (not even as much as a hug from someone from the opposite sex). Asked out a girl I had a crush on (for almost a year) this March and she refused. What hurt me more is she broke up all contact with me post it although I thought we were good friends. Have a lot of physical deficiencies and weaknesses too.

Sometimes I feel I'm really faking the depression given that there are people who have more serious problems than me (dysfunctional family, child abuse etc). Hence haven't been able to confront myself to go to a therapist yet. 

'It gets better' Well atleast that's not been my experience for the past few years. When I think that it cannot get any more worse, life's like 'Hold my beer here' and throws me into a quicksand, and I just keep on sinking even further.

What stops me from pulling the ledge?
I've got a wonderful family! My dad, mum and a younger sibling. They all care for me so much that I can't think of the consequences of me ceasing to exist would have on them. The past three years have been hard for all of us, and I don't understand how they cope up with it. They're the only thing that keeps me from entertaining the thought of calling it off. 
But I'm not sure how much long I can hold up. If not for these I would have just shut it down. But here I am stuck so that I don't hurt them.

It's not healthy to be critical of ourselves for where we 'should be' when it's up to us to decide that and much healthier to accept that we simply are where we are while reflecting on past achievements. I'm sure many reading this know how that isn't as easy or simple as it seems, far from it.

TLDR; I feel like I'm still here, wrapped in this depressing cloud, this haze- I cling on in hopes of living the life I want to yet it seems so difficult. I learnt to cope in this dark cacoon that saps my energy with help yet see no way out

I'm studying to build myself up in hopes I'll be able to get a job or at least a routine. That's proving quite difficult however. It's been a few months and still the insomnia persists despite help from my therapist. Often ot feels my efforts of self help and even external help fall in to this black void.

What has helped me is meditation. Sometimes it causes me to fall asleep and makes routine harder, other times it gives me clarity. I've tried many things. Recently quit coffee and have tried medications with no luck.

Days like today make it hard to cling on to hope. I want to, especially for my parents. I still live with them and often my depression screams 'leech' in to my mind. I try to remember I owe it to myself and those who haven't given up on me (unlike some of my therapists and past friends)  to keep going.

One thing that's on my mind is that I've accomplished a lot. I can eat regularly now, I can get out of bed, even if it takes a while, my mindset is much better and there are even things that I want to do... The main hurdle right now is that I'm not doing those things.

Do you know that feeling when you read a book and your mind blanks? Cooking, baking, guitar, streaming, studying etc. That wall of hazy emptiness appears.

It's hard to build routine when the activities that would tire me out seem impossible. When exercise hasn't helped despite it being one of the few things I'm able to stick to. That doesn't mean I'll give up. It'd be nice to have a silver lining though. Hopefully my next appointment and medication will be a step close, whatever the outcome.

The main hurdle right now is that I&amp;#39;m not doing those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know that feeling when you read a book and your mind blanks? Cooking, baking, guitar, streaming, studying etc. That wall of hazy emptiness appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to build routine when the activities that would tire me out seem impossible. When exercise hasn&amp;#39;t helped despite it being one of the few things I&amp;#39;m able to stick to. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean I&amp;#39;ll give up. It&amp;#39;d be nice to have a silver lining though. Hopefully my next appointment and medication will be a step close, whatever the outcome. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll end this by saying that I hope you all have a great day and halloween. Stay spooky and keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I am new to reddit — I’ve been browsing around for a while now, but I’ve lacked the courage to post anything. I can relate to a lot of what has been posted, and I now feel like it’s time that I share my story:

I grew up in a chaotic household (like I’m sure a lot of you have): my mother was mentally unstable given my father lacked a steady income and was constantly finding and experimenting with entrepreneurial projects that failed to provide our family with any steady source of income. My most vivid memories (when I can actually remember, which is difficult when you have MDD) are my parents fighting constantly about mortgage payments, infidelity on business trips, and lack of extended family support. My parents divorced when I was 12 — I I lived in multiple houses growing up with my mom, and my dad has been in and out of my life ever since, though he’s been more involved these past couple of years (I actually lived on his couch from 25 to 26).

However, fortunately, I was able to push through (or ignore)a lot of these family problems growing up, though I was still considered weird by a lot of people my age. I was an excellent high school student: I graduated with a 4.2 gpa and played two sports in which I was a captain for one them senior year. I went on to an elite private college on the east coast in which I played a varsity sport for 4 years. I had an amazing gf who I loved very much (we were together for 4 years in college, and one year after). I was confident and genuinely believed in myself: I didn’t have a fake belief in myself, but a deep love and care for myself. I graduated with a solid gpa as well as a couple of awards for both sports and academics.

After I graduated, my life spiraled out of control: I became deeply, deeply depressed and started to hate my self, a hatred so deep words cannot describe how I felt. I was stuck at a job that meant nothing to me, and spent my weekends indulging in alcohol and marijuana (my brain doesn’t react well to either of those substances). Each day I started to feel more and more “out of it”, emotionally numb, and dysphoric: I felt nothing, there was nothing to live for, and I stopped enjoying everything that used to bring me meaning and joy. I quit my job after 7 months, and I moved back home, leaving behind everything that I worked hard for: a job, friends that respected me, and a loving gf. 

After moving back, I was EXTREMELY heart broken after leaving my ex: I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t able to be the rock and support system for her anymore, I couldn’t understand why I felt so emotionally numb, and I couldn’t understand why there wasn’t any intimacy or passion in the sex or relationship anymore. I started to question my entire existence and identity, and I fell into the darkest depression a person could fall into: I literally questioned everything — I didn’t know my name, my gender, where I was born, my sexual orientation. Nothing felt real — I couldn’t tell real memories from fake memories. I had no sense of self which was slowly destroying me. 

Fast forward a year - I was living at home, unemployed and miserable. I ended up taking the GRE and applied to a graduate program at an Ivy League school. Got in, did that, but I still hated my self the whole time (depression, dysphoria, anxiety) it was just that I was able to hide it and distract myself in academics.

After getting my grad degree, I moved home, and I failed to keep in contact with everyone I met in school. Again, the cycle continued: depressed, dysphoric, unemployed, anxious, living at home, and lonely. I couldn’t figure out how to hold on to a job or even find one; I just wanted to go back to school again for the third time, take out more loans, and become further in debt. I stopped caring completely, about everything.

I started to watch porn, have sex with random girls to boost my self esteem (it never did) and drink heavily, and I also got into COCAINE, which completely destroyed me: I felt worthless and lost before, oh boy did cocaine just absolutely fuck me up. My delusions and dysphoria started to worsen: my life goal was to become a cocaine dealer in Mexico (started looking at plane tickets) or a lady boy in Thailand. My entire sex drive was in ruins: I had nothing solid to hold onto, again, a very fragile self image around who I was as human being with very intense dysphoria. For example, I would have repeated videos in my brain of being raped over and over again: I genuinely believed I was a victim of childhood rape, but there is no evidence of that. I went on a cocaine and alcohol binge one night, and the only thing I remember is the next morning being driven to the emergency room: I had gotten the shit beat out of me at the bar, been handcuffed  by the cops, driven home by them, and started threatening to kill myself as well as my entire family. At the emergency room, I had an insanely high blood alcohol content as well as cocaine in my system (even the day after). I talked to the social worker/psychologist there, and he determined that I was suicidal and delusional, so he put me in the schizophrenic unit of the psych ward for three days, but after the first day I was moved to the major depression and anxiety unit as they believed that was a better fit. 

I got out after 4 or 5 days, and I went to see a mental health professional voluntarily for the first time since I was a child: I saw a psychologist when I was young, but that was it. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic features, and I was prescribed Abilify and Lexapro. I had been taking both for about a year and a half; however, I went cold turkey on the Lexapro two or three weeks ago and tapered off the Abilify myself a month and a half ago: I just couldn’t stand the weight gain ( I probably gained 50 lbs) and it really didn’t make me feel at peace with myself, it was a bandaid, and I genuinely knew that from the bottom of my heart.

Moved back to the Ivy League town where I graduated from, and I was able to find a job doing consulting work (think about one of those jobs that only rich connected people get); but I quit after 8 months because I wanted to become a professional poker player. I moved to Las Vegas, got an apartment, and started playing at the casinos. Covid happened, I lost my money, and moved back home again. Again, cycle repeats itself. 

I recently found a job in another state doing bullshit office work: think Dilbert or Office Space. But, I have come to terms with it, and I’m doing my best to find joy in the little things. I have completely quit alcohol: it’s not even an option. I’m done with it, forever. Drugs and alcohol absolutely crush me. 

I still have intense bouts of crippling depression and anxiety attacks which I’ve come to realize are fueled by my inability to understand who I am or hold onto any sort of solid self image of myself at the deepest level: this prevents me from seeking out genuine relationships with other people, whether that be friends or a significant other. I am still questioning all aspects of my self: Am I straight or gay? Am I male or female? Where am I from? What is my name? Who are my family members? Memories don’t seem real, nothing seems real anymore. It’s wearing me down, and I can’t imagine that a person could go through so much pain and still exist. It’s a miracle.

I’m seeing a new psychiatrist, and I am hopeful he will help. I’ve been stable before, relatively content and at peace with myself; I am hoping to get back to that place again. I can’t give up.

Thanks for reading.

&lt;p&gt;Should I cut them some slack and take a break? Is there another way to go about this?&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I am new to reddit — I’ve been browsing around for a while now, but I’ve lacked the courage to post anything. I can relate to a lot of what has been posted, and I now feel like it’s time that I share my story:

I grew up in a chaotic household (like I’m sure a lot of you have): my mother was relatively mentally unstable given my father lacked a steady income and was constantly finding and experimenting with entrepreneurial projects that failed to provide our family with any steady source of income. My most vivid memories (when I can actually remember, which is difficult when you have MDD) are my parents fighting constantly about mortgage payments, infidelity on business trips, and lack of extended family support. My parents divorced when I was 12 — I lived in multiple houses growing up with my mom, and my dad has been in and out of my life ever since, though he’s been more involved these past couple of years (I actually lived on his couch from ages 25 to 26).

However, fortunately, I was able to push through (or ignore)a lot of these family problems growing up, though I was still considered weird by a lot of people my age. I was an excellent high school student: I graduated with a 4.2 gpa and played two sports in which I was a captain for one them senior year. I went on to an elite private college on the east coast in which I played a varsity sport for 4 years. I had an amazing gf who I loved very much (we were together for 4 years in college, and one year after). I was confident and genuinely believed in myself: not a fake belief, but a deep love and care for myself. I graduated with a solid gpa as well as a couple of awards for both sports and academics.

After I graduated, my life spiraled out of control: I became deeply, deeply depressed and started to hate my self, a hatred so deep words cannot describe. I was stuck at a job that meant nothing to me, and spent my weekends indulging in alcohol and marijuana (my brain doesn’t react well to either of those substances). Each day I started to feel more and more “out of it”, emotionally numb, and dysphoric: I felt nothing, there was nothing to live for, and I stopped enjoying everything that used to bring me meaning and joy. I quit my job after 7 months, and I moved back home, leaving behind everything that I worked hard for: a job, friends that respected me, and a loving gf. 

After moving back, I was EXTREMELY heart broken after leaving my ex: I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t able to be the rock and support system for her anymore, I couldn’t understand why I felt so emotionally numb, and I couldn’t understand why there wasn’t any intimacy or passion in the sex or relationship anymore. I started to question my entire existence and identity, and I fell into the darkest depression a person could fall into: I literally questioned everything — I didn’t know my name, my gender, where I was born, my sexual orientation. Nothing felt real — I couldn’t tell real memories from fake memories. There was no sense of self which was slowly destroying me. 

Fast forward a year - I was living at home, unemployed and miserable. I ended up taking the GRE and applied to a graduate program at an Ivy League school. Got in, did that, but I still hated my self the whole time (depression, dysphoria, anxiety) it was just that I was able to hide it and distract myself in academics.

After getting my grad degree, I moved home, and I failed to keep in contact with everyone I met in school. Again, the cycle continued: depressed, dysphoric, unemployed, anxious, living at home, and lonely. I couldn’t figure out how to hold on to a job or even find one; I just wanted to go back to school again for the third time, take out more loans, and become further in debt. I stopped caring completely, about everything.

I started to watch porn, have sex with random girls to boost my self esteem (it never did) and drink heavily, and I also got into COCAINE, which completely destroyed me: I felt worthless and lost before, oh boy did cocaine just absolutely fuck me up. My delusions and dysphoria started to worsen: my life goal was to become a cocaine dealer in Mexico (started looking at plane tickets) or a lady boy in Thailand. My entire sex drive was in ruins: I had nothing solid to hold onto, again, a very fragile self image around who I was as human being with very intense dysphoria. For example, I would have repeated videos in my brain of being raped over and over again: I genuinely believe I was a victim of childhood rape, but there is no evidence of that. I went on a cocaine and alcohol binge one night, and the only thing I remember is the next morning being driven to the emergency room: apparently I had gotten the shit beat out of me at the bar, been handcuffed  by the cops, driven home by them, and started threatening to kill myself as well as my entire family. At the emergency room, I had an insanely high blood alcohol content as well as cocaine in my system (even the day after). I talked to the social worker/psychologist there, and he determined that I was suicidal and delusional, so he put me in the schizophrenic unit of the psych ward for three days, but after the first day I was moved to the major depression and anxiety unit as they believed that was a better fit. 

I got out after 4 or 5 days, and I went to see a mental health professional voluntarily for the first time since I was a child: I saw a psychologist when I was young, but that was it. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic features, and I was prescribed Abilify and Lexapro. I had been taking both for about a year and a half; however, I went cold turkey on the Lexapro two or three weeks ago and tapered off the Abilify myself a month and a half ago: I just couldn’t stand the weight gain ( I probably gained 50 lbs) and it really didn’t make me feel at peace with myself, it was a bandaid, and I genuinely knew that from the bottom of my heart.

Moved back to the Ivy League town where I graduated from, and I was able to find a job doing consulting work (think about one of those jobs that only rich connected people get); but I quit after 8 months because I wanted to become a professional poker player. I moved to Las Vegas, got an apartment, and started playing at the casinos. Covid happened, I lost my money, and moved back home again. Again, cycle repeats itself. 

I Recently found a job in another state doing bullshit office work: think Dilbert or Office Space. But, I have come to terms with it, and I’m doing my best to find joy in the little things. I have completely quit alcohol: like it’s not even an option. I’m done with it, forever. Drugs and alcohol absolutely crush me. 

I still have intense bouts of crippling depression and anxiety attacks which I’ve come to realize are fueled by my inability to understand who I am or hold onto any sort of solid self image of myself at the deepest level: this prevents me from seeking out genuine relationships with other people, whether that be friends or significant other. I am still questioning all aspects of my self: Am I straight or gay? Am I male or female? Where am I from? What is my name? Who are my family members? Memories don’t seem real, nothing seems real anymore. It’s wearing me down, and I can’t imagine that a person could go through so much pain and still exist. It’s a miracle.

I’m seeing a new psychiatrist, and I am hopeful he will help. I’ve been stable before, relatively content and at peace with myself; I am hoping to get back to that place again. I can’t give up.

,depression,"TLDR: Are there any supplements that will help with my appetite and energy?

I feel so drained and im mentally, emotionally and physically hurting. My body physically hurts especially my chest and stomach and I don't have heart problems I know it's stress. I have no support and I have a teenager so I need my appetite and energy. 2019 - NOW has been hell and the hits keep coming. I feel broken but only in few pieces not shattered. I feel like one day I will say this experience has been like a Japanese Kintsugi project and I've recovered better than I was before. 

I've surrounded myself with energy vampires and they've finally drained me dry and I'm on my last Mario life. My toxic upbringing taught me to give support and except all the reasons why others can't give it. My OCD  and constant need to be good enough for everyone turned me into a fixer, emotional supporter, ms i got ur back, super mom, corporate climber and obsessive worrier.

I now know expecting support from friends and a romantic partner is a requirement and not an option but I'm too drained to go out and meet people. I'm not strong. My mental health is just as important as everyone elses. Just because I smile and try to fix it doesn't mean I can do it on my own. Yes I ask for support. No I don't get it. I need what I give to others, that I thought was ok to not receive because they weren't capable because I'm an empath. I'm not an empath! That belief is fucking toxic and I wish people would stop pushing that toxic trash on the ""strong friend"". I'm NOT STRONG, I JUST CARE! I WAS EXHAUSTED WHEN YOU ALL THOUGHT I WAS STRONG!

I was just released from a toxic roller coaster and I don't have the energy to date. I need to make more professional female friends but I'd actually have to leave the house for that. My daughter needs to get her license in 30 days and we have no support from her father's family so I have to get out of bed but she can be draining as well. 

Are there any supplements that will help with my appetite and energy? Bromelain helps with my appetite but makes me tired and gives me insane sleep paralysis and nightmares.

,depression,"I’m 18 years old. A few years ago I realized I was depressed and I thought not was the worst thing that could ever happen to me. A lot of it was caused by my best friend who is now my ex girlfriend. She manipulated me and made me feel like I was worthless and constantly made fun of me and told me I acted like a 5 year old and that I needed to leave my family because they didn’t know what was best for me. She talked me into doing things I didn’t exactly want to do. I spent all my time outside of school in my bed either crying or talking to her on the phone. I tried to kill myself 7 times and nobody ever knew. I went to therapy a few times and I miraculously thought I was “better”. I didn’t feel sad anymore and I started to do things that I liked to do again. About a year passed where I thought that I was no longer depressed. Then a week ago I played an online game called Doki Doki Literature Club. One of the characters in the game, Sayori, is depressed. She describes her depression in depth, and I realized that it was exactly how I felt. The more I thought about it, I realized that while I didn’t feel depressed anymore, I wasn’t happy either. I feel like my emotions are gone. I am unable to cry no matter what happens or what I do. My face will feel like I’m crying and I will actually sob, but no tears come out. I just wail. I’m so frustrated. I’ve started to cut myself because that’s at least a feeling. I just want so bad to have my feelings again.  I feel like I’m not actually here. I wrote this to describe what I’m feeling. 

I feel like I am someone that I am not

I want to go home

I want my head back

I want my mind back

Please let me feel something

I feel nothing 

I am not happy

I am not sad

Where am I

I long for the days I was depressed 

I long for the days when I wished I was dead

At least I felt something

Something is better than nothing

At least I could cry

I wish I could cry

Please let me cry

Please let me feel something

I hope the cuts help

They need to be deeper

I need to hurt

I need to feel pain

At least I can make myself feel pain

I want to be in control

Let me back in

I want to be me again

Please

I want to want to die

That’s it. I hope this reaches someone. I have friends but I’m so alone. I can’t let them know that anything is wrong with me.

A few years ago I realized I was depressed and I thought not was the worst thing that could ever happen to me. A lot of it was caused by my best friend who is now my ex girlfriend. She manipulated me and made me feel like I was worthless and constantly made fun of me and told me I acted like a 5 year old and that I needed to leave my family because they didn’t know what was best for me. She talked me into doing things I didn’t exactly want to do. I spent all my time outside of school in my bed either crying or talking to her on the phone. I tried to kill myself 7 times and nobody ever knew. I went to therapy a few times and I miraculously thought I was “better”. I didn’t feel sad anymore and I started to do things that I liked to do again. About a year passed where I thought that I was no longer depressed. Then a week ago I played an online game called Doki Doki Literature Club. One of the characters in the game, Sayori, is depressed. She describes her depression in depth, and I realized that it was exactly how I felt. The more I thought about it, I realized that while I didn’t feel depressed anymore, I wasn’t happy either. I feel like my emotions are gone. I am unable to cry no matter what happens or what I do. My face will feel like I’m crying and I will actually sob, but no tears come out. I just wail. I’m so frustrated. I’ve started to cut myself because that’s at least a feeling. I just want so bad to have my feelings again.  I feel like I’m not actually here. I wrote this to describe what I’m feeling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I am someone that I am not&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go home&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want my head back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want my mind back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me feel something&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel nothing &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not happy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where am I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I long for the days I was depressed &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I long for the days when I wished I was dead&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least I felt something&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something is better than nothing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least I could cry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could cry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me cry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me feel something&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope the cuts help&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They need to be deeper&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to hurt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to feel pain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least I can make myself feel pain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be in control&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me back in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be me again&lt;/p&gt;

But then after starting to worry again, I tried something. I said intentionally in my head: „I am happy.“ Now, I know what you’re thinking.

I will only say that if I’m happy already anyway.“ But I realized that thinking that way never got me anywhere, so I finally submitted and tried to open up to the world so it could help me. 

And for a brief moment, I did feel happy. It actually worked. I felt the same feeling like I felt when I was a child. Curious, loving, in love with life and people. I said it again and again, just in my head. „I am happy.“ For a tiny moment, I felt like my old young self again. It was like I learned the word „happy“ again for the first time and what it means. Or like I met my happy self from a parallel universe saying: Finally we get to meet again! I’ve missed you all this time.

Ive tried to listen to robert sapolsky and sam harris, for some information on why i am here, and what i can do to suffer less. And ive spend so much time trying to figure out consciousness, and how the mind works. How a lot of it is genes, and we maybe dont have free will. But that meditation can help. But everytime i meditate i cant seem to stop ruminating. My brain just wants to overthink and bealive in stuff that isnt true. Damn, and there are so many loving and caring people around me, but it just dosent seem to help my depression. Im sorry for this rant, i just had to write it down somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

i’ve been depressed for 7-8 years now since i was very young. i’ve been clinically diagnosed with severe depression and i used to see a therapist. i used so self-harm and i tried to off myself a few times. right now i still feel like that and i picked up smoking for a bit, but i stopped as well since i didnt smoke enough to develop an addiction. i dont self-harm anymore and i haven’t tried to off myself in years now. i’ve been going through a tough time lately and i read the book “the subtle art of not giving a fuck”. in the book, the author talks about this bear that would go around telling people blunt but much needed advice. so i asked some very close friends that question since i wanted to know their honest perspective and insight. one friend talked about my mental health. she said that i need to look to the future and not the past. that she thought it was weak of me and that there are people going through so much more such as diseases and still trying. she said it made her angry and upset. and she told me i wasn’t trying and that when negative thoughts happens i should think positive thoughts to counteract it. i tried explaining to her that i was trying and that my first priority is to survive not to be happy yet and she told me this wasn’t good enough. she then said no matter what even if i keep telling her im trying my best, her answer would always be to try harder. she told me she was also going through a tough time due to her mom and when i kept talking about depression, self-harm and s***ide it made her start self-harming again too but one day she woke up and realized this isn’t the way. she said she forced herself to think positive thoughts and told me i need to do the same. honestly that talk just made me feel so much worse and i started reverting. i wanted to self harm again and i was sobbing and having a panic attack. i didnt tell her any of this because i dont want her to blame herself so i told her to talk another day. i ended up just drawing on myself as did not want to start doing my self destructive behaviour again. i dont know how to tell her she hurt me and honestly im wondering if she is right. i dont know if i want this friendship to continue as i am leaning towards no now but i dont know how to express it. sorry about mistakes and formatting i am on my phone crying.",t2_34twtpwt,False,,0,False,friend says i dont try hard enough,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_jh87sb,False,dark,0.84,,public,4,2,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603571904.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friendship advice please&lt;/p&gt;

I know I have to quit smoking, that can&amp;#39;t possibly be helping my mood or motivation, but I&amp;#39;m afraid of what will happen from there; part of me thinks that once I quit, I&amp;#39;ll just be forced to dealing with whatever underlying feelings had me depressed before I ever started smoking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I&amp;#39;m not the only person who feels this way. But is there a path out? I really just want to feel normal again.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression," Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'll try to recount everything from my perspective, I would really appreciate some honest answers on this as I've been desperately trying to wrap my brain around it.

So I meet this man, and for the first month its a whirlwind of dating (lunches, dinners, sleepovers, hiking, etc.) and sex. Lots of really great sex. Everything is fine til the last few times we see each other.

List of incidents:

\-For context, we've seen each other at least 10 times prior to all of this. One time he snapped at me for hugging him one morning, saying I was needy like his dog and was stressing him out so much. This was without any warning, but of course I stepped back and respected that boundary.

\-He gave me chlamydia, and disappearing for a week until *I* asked how *he* was. When I confronted him about not checking up on me, he said he felt really embarrassed.

\-The second to last time we saw each other he immediately started saying my 'anxiety' was stressing him out and making him react in a very negative way. I felt super calm with him, so again, I was confused. He later apologized and said he was cranky and overtired. Then after this I saw him last night, we had great sex and conversation, and started opening up a bit more. We had a ton of banter which I guess made him reach a breaking point. We were on the couch holding hands and he suddenly gets up and starts raising his voice saying I'm stressing him out so much and he needs to take me home, and 'how many times he needs to bash \[my\] head in before I realize that enough is enough' (mind you he has NOT gotten physically violent with me). He proceeds to take me home with music blasting and at a very high speed. We get to my house and he apologizes for raising his voice while still raising it, and I apologize for joking with him so much and realized how much that could have upset him. As he usually does, he then belittled my interpersonal skills and said I have zero emotional intelligence and don't know how to interact with people or my limits and that I have 'so much to learn'. I bring up the times he's made me feel really low and he got even more upset saying I'm just doing tit for tat. Then he said he needed to go home and get a pain killer and how he can't imagine this would ever progress.

I think what worries me the most is that the times he blew up there was zero warning sign and zero communication beforehand, he just suddenly starts raising his voice and accusing me of having really bad energy and making him feel uncomfortable. Is this my fault? Or is this just a sick power dynamic? And am I right in feeling confused or do I just keep messing up?

,depression,"Hello!
I got diagnosed with major depression and some other things almost two months ago after struggling for years and finally deciding to get professional help.

My mother knows about this and knows about my struggles. When I'm home (which I am most of the time because of corona and because of depression) I'm usually not smiling.
In the evenings I like to talk with some friends on Discord and play video games with them which makes me talk more and laugh a lot.

Today my mum asked me 'where my depression is because I'm laughing a lot when talking to friends '.
I told her already that the combination of talking to friends and video games makes me happier and it distracts me from thinking and feeling like shit because my friends talk a lot.
However she doesn't understand that doing other things like cleaning my room doesn't distract me because I'm alone and overthinking. I have the feeling that she expects me to laugh and smile while cleaning my room which won't happen because I feel really bad whenever I'm alone with my thoughts.

,depression,"I (22f) don't know what to do. I will explain the situation, and I hope someone can sugest something that maybe can help. 

First of all, sorry for my english, it's not my main language. I've been dealing with depression for the most part of my life, because my life was shit (I won't get into deatails). But now I don't have a really bad life, I have food and a roof over my head, my mother and my cat love me, and I don't have to work, I go to college. I'm studying law (I hate it) but I don't know what else to study because I don't like anything and I don't want to do anything. I feel like I don't have a purpose. Anyway I want to finish studying and just go to work and that's it. I accept it.

The problem is that I can't enjoy anything. I stay almost everyday in bed, sometimes reading, sometimes just looking at the phone. I can't seem to find the energy to get up and do things, because I don't want to do anything. Sometimes I force myself to get up and whatch a movie or play some game, or hang out with friends, but I don't feel good doing it, I'm bored and sad and I just want the day to finish. When I'm out I just want to go home, but when I'm home I feel sad and bored and I just don't want to be here or anywere. I know life is not perfect, but I just want to at least do things that I like, enjoy mu free time, I don't know. I don't feel good doing anything. I've been having again suicide thoughts (I've been having them my whole life, they just come and dissapear and then come again even though my life is okay now). 

I'm going to a psychologist but it's not helping, I have taken anti depressants but they didn't helped either. I'm not taking any medication right now. I don't know what to do. I hate to be in bed all day losing time and doing nothing, but when I force myself to do something I still don't enjoy it and I feel sad and bad and bored and sometimes angry and want to hurt myself. Maybe it's because I don't have a purpose in life, but I don't know hos to hace that, I've been thinking a lot every day about something that would make me feel okay but I just can't find it.

&lt;p&gt;First of all, sorry for my english, it&amp;#39;s not my main language. I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with depression for the most part of my life, because my life was shit (I won&amp;#39;t get into deatails). But now I don&amp;#39;t have a really bad life, I have food and a roof over my head, my mother and my cat love me, and I don&amp;#39;t have to work, I go to college. I&amp;#39;m studying law (I hate it) but I don&amp;#39;t know what else to study because I don&amp;#39;t like anything and I don&amp;#39;t want to do anything. I feel like I don&amp;#39;t have a purpose. Anyway I want to finish studying and just go to work and that&amp;#39;s it. I accept it.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"When i was younger, at the start of my 9th grade winter, I started getting into Call of Duty. I noticed my skill level was above others on the game so I continued playing the game, day in and day out. After volleyballl practice, I would come home turn on my xbox and tv just play all night. Just like my 9th grade self, I see myself doing this today.

Here’s my worry. I can’t recall a moment in my life before my ex that is struggled with my self identity. what should i do now? what have I become? Am I doing the right thing with my time?

I (tried?) To kill myself a few months ago, and short of  a literal miracle that means I'm dead. I remember I was in my car. I heard the gun go off. Then all I heard was my ears ringing. I use reloaded ammo and the only way this is possible is I shot one that didn't have powder in it. I had to push the bullet out of the barrel because it got stuck.. 

But I think it worked. I think this life I'm living since then, is my personalized hell. My wife left me 2 and a half years ago. Since my (attempt?) our relationship has gotten better.

But looking at my life as a hole, all the things happening to me, are what I would believe my hell would look like.

I seek a lot of comfort in people sharing the exact same thoughts and emotions as me, as my friends and family don't understand what I'm going through at all. I don't really care if people see this post or not, it's just a way for me to get things off my chest. I try to talk to my friends about my depression, but none of them understand (and I can't blame them for that). 

TLDR: Life is in fucking shambles, don't have the effort to do anything, i've lost everything. What do you do to stay on top of your life?

I've been battling with depression for years, but I was able to function with it. I maintained a social life, maintained a good physique and healthy diet, received good grades and was able to do things. When COVID hit this year, and I was forced to be in lock down, in an apartment by myself, my demons got the best of me. It's been downhill ever since. I've lost all my muscle, I've gotten fat, I've dropped out of university, I've lost friends, I can't function. It's just so overwhelmingly hard to do anything. I'm often in bed all day, with the only thing getting me out of bed being video games, but I don't even find them that fun anymore, so I go back to bed and repeat the vicious cycle. 

I talk to a psychologist and psychiatrist, but they are so busy that appointments are often once a month or two, which is not even the bare minimum I require. On top of that, they're stupidly expensive and I can't work. I'm on the maximum dose for duloxetine and it's not working at all, I've tried about 2 other drugs and they didn't work at all. My life is quickly crumbling, often leaving me every night thinking of suicide. I know I will never act on it, because I can never let my friends and family experience that pain. My only hope of me getting better is the small hope of discovering a drug that will work for me, but who knows how long that will be. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the rare people who are still here reading this. Thank you. I seek for your advice, how can I get on top of the small things that will better my life? Such as going to the gym, going for a walk, cooking my own food, etc. I know so many things that would better my life, and I just can't do it. I don't have the energy or motivation. So many fucking people tell me to JUST do it, but they don't realise how hard it is for me to do it.

,depression,"For about 3 weeks now I have been getting better. Not that I have haven't got any bad days, but I can handle them like how I can only assume a normal person can handle them. Even that thing that I have been told ""get over it"" it is sometimes doable and it feels surreal. Once I start looking at mental health as a physical condition of the brain, I always searched ways to get my brain working better and I will share the 2 things that helped.

1. Most important thing is enough oxygen to the brain. I am not talking about 5 min yoga or running or meditation. I am talking breathing correctly the entire day and during sleep.
2. Diet. Many things can cause allergies, inflammation, and all sorts of issues that can be really bad for the brain. I am slowly transitioning to lowcarb/carnivore diet. Also the brain really needs high quality nutrients, only found in meat.

I always hated yoga and exercise since I it made me feel good for a moment but then I was depressed as usual after awhile. I didn't realise that the breathing part was the key, and I needed to do it all day. Same with diet, when I eat what's good for me my lungs feel so much better and I breathe correctly. I am smoking still but I feel that I can quit, for the first time I have a bit of that thing confidence.

It took me about 1 week to start to think more clearly, and now at week 3 I am starting to work on some psychological problems with ease as I can make connection in my brain that I couldn't do before, and fix old connection that make no sense and are there because my brain was not functioning right.

,depression,"(REPOST BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE SOMEONE TO READ MY STORY I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY)


There are imposters among myself

(Before you begin to read, the title was to sorta of hook you in and get some sort of laugh)

For the past 2-3ish months it has been nothing but hell for me, and the only thing I do to escape is play video games, so I got online and I was waiting for an invitation to a party filled with people who I consider friends. I waited and waited so then I said screw it I’ll join manually. I don’t usually do that because I don’t like joining parties out of nowhere because I’m afraid of them not wanting me in there. I say “hi” and got no response like usually. Then the night went on as usual. They start talking and if I talk or put my two cents in about something my brother tells me to shut up and his friends and my friends gang up on me and I get insulted about stuff I did in the past (i did nothing bad to clarify, just mistakes) then I go mute for the rest of the night until someone acknowledges me then I say “hi” then it repeats.

Now a rather more specific situation that happened 4 days ago.

I was playing Minecraft and I was acting upset about everything and about what was going to happen to me probably. (I’m also a pessimist) my friend asks me “hey what’s wrong” and then I proceed to tell what has been going on. I say “hey you still here?” To check if they are still listening. *no response* I say “hello?” *still no response* I assumed she left to go do something without telling me that she had to go do something (which no one I know does that and I mean NO ONE) ,so I assumed that she didn’t care. 

I tried to talk to another friend, but they had stuff going on too so when that happens I bury my thoughts and feelings until the issue is resolved. I was expecting for him talk to me about it because we have done it before, but I still have no clue what is going on.

That friend had helped me in the past by telling me what my friends said behind my back and from what he told me that he was crying because he felt bad for me. I didn’t want to know what they were saying because I just wanted to play video games.

To rap up the rest of it because it is 2:46 AM for me 

My friend’s blame me for stuff I didn’t do, they insult me, they don’t talk to me on Snapchat; no one responds, I’ll join to talk to them, but they try to piss me off and get a chuckle out of it.

Anyways i feel like im a jester to them, I feel like they want to push me away, and to me they’re the only friends I have and if I don’t have them with me I’ll just be lonely like I’am 95% of the day. I don’t go outside I’m doing online school because I had a choice, I don’t get invited to things, and I feel im the last person someone thinks of.

They’re all I have left to talk, relate, and share my feelings with.

First of all I lost both my jobs in March due to pandemic I was on the verge of moving out and was looking forward to starting a new life. I’m in my mid 20s and my parents are struggling to keep the house. My mother was a childminder her job has been lost. My father has crippling anxiety the type where he can’t go to work without needing to come home after a hour. He hasn’t worked in 2 years.

To explain how bad my fathers anxiety is. He constantly has his phone on listening to podcasts everywhere he goes his phone is blaring he can’t put his electric cigarette down he has it in his hands 24 7 he can no longer watch tv as he thinks advertisements are annoying and it heightens his anxiety. He also can’t stay still constantly rummaging and dropping things and sniffing all the time as if he has ocd. He constantly rushes my mother and puts pressure on her to be ready when he expects it and fights with her if she doesn’t hurry up. He can’t handle family members being sick his own mother is sick but my mam does everything for her while he sits and listens to podcasts and sits in the car because he can’t handle seeing her like that. 

He won’t go to hospital appointments with his mother because he hates waiting and according to him makes his anxiety worse. There was a few times he left my mother in the car park out of spite while she was doing food shopping because she took too long and it drive him mad then I had to collect her I normally bring her instead of him because he hates waiting. When he gets into his moods he calls my mother all sorts of names like fat useless tells her to F off and it will go on for hours. He doesn’t go to the doctors the doctors won’t help him anymore because he refuses to help himself. Talking to him and trying to help him is like banging your head against a wall because he is so stubborn and doesn’t listen to nobody. My mother is very unhappy but she can’t do anything about it because she has no where to go. He sits around all day starting arguments with everyone my brother and I contribute over 400 euro to go to the mortgage which is well over a thousand but the house is in serious danger of being repossessed at this stage. 

I suggested that maybe the best thing to do would be to sell the house and he flipped out telling me to f to off and that he worked for the house and he will never leave it. He can’t afford his car or tax he is driving around with expired tax for months if he is stopped the car will be taken which means more money again. Im at a loss on what to do the rent In this country is insane and Without any job right now I don’t know what to do.

,depression,"I can't even remember the last time I felt like I could trust someone enough to open up to them about how I feel. It definitely didn't help that I regretted it each time I ever did.

I was fourteen the first time I truly thought about killing myself. I can still remember looking over the edge of bridge. It wasn't high enough to do the job, but there was a rock. I thought if I dove onto the rock it'll surely knock me out. Then the river could do the rest. I mean, I wouldn't be the first person to drown in it.

It's still the first option I always think of when I consider doing it again. Jumping, not drowning. I don't think I'm brave enough to do it that way. I'd probably just pussy out and swim back to shore. But then, it's not like I was brave enough to do it by jumping either though.

Anyway, what was I talking about? Oh yea, telling someone about how I feel. Not as in telling them how I feel about them, although I'm not very good at that either. Just telling them how I feel about myself. How I feel like shit all of the time. So eventually, I don't know if it was that I finally felt as though I could trust someone enough to do it or I just that felt so lonely that I had to try.

So I had this friend. And she got it, she felt the same way all the time as well. And she told me. She told me how she felt shit, depressed, and how she wanted to kill herself and how she had already tried the year before. It didn't work, thankfully. I was the first person she told. Or at least that's what she told me. So what do you do when your best friend tell you she wants to die? Well I don't know what you would do but I can tell you what I did. I'd visit her at work on my days off. I'd go out with her anytime she did because she always ended the night in tears and I didn't want her to feel alone when that happened. And I started to message her each morning. I messaged her almost every single morning for over a year with a small comic in the hopes that it would cheer her up and maybe help her start her day off with a smile. I would call her during work if I got a message saying she was having a bad day and I would stay on the phone until she felt better. I even have messages from her saying that the only reason she's still alive is because of me. I didn't like those messages though, all I did was help. All I did was what I thought you were supposed to do when your friend tells you they need help.

So I had one week where I was feeling worse than usual. The worst thing about it was that there was no reason for it. I think that's one of the worst things about depression, it just comes back again and again even if you think you're finally getting passed it. The herpes of the brain. But anyway, I hadn't heard back from her in a few days, which wasn't altogether abnormal, sometimes life's hard enough and talking about it is even harder. But I was feeling extra shitty and I could've used someone to talk to so I tried to tell her I was  going through a hard time. After all, she had promised multiple times to be there if I ever needed help. But we've all heard that before, right?

So I told her I felt lonely. I told her that I felt so fucking alone and that I'm so god damn tired of feeling that way. And... nothing. That was the last message for almost a week. It sucked. Here I was thinking that if I had no one else surely, after everything else I would at least have her, that she would've at least messaged to see if I was okay or to try and make me feel not so completely alone. Anything would've been better than nothing.

After a few days it started to pass. Either that or I just got used to it again ad I went back to messaging her each morning with little comics or jokes. Calvin and Hobbes was always my go to but I'd always try to find to find different ones so it didn't get repetitive. And then I got a message back. It was a big one. It started off by apologising for taking so long to respond but that didn't matter. Like I said, sometimes she can take a while to message back. But then she started to explain why.

You see, not long before all this she was feeling suicidal again so I thought I needed to do something to change that. I sent her a bunch of messages telling her how she's loved and since I wasn't able to call her right then I sent her a video telling her how important she is and when these virus restrictions ease and she can finally fly home then I'm going to give her some time to catch up with her family and then I'm going to come up and we can finally catch up. Now I'll admit that I may have piled it on strong but can you blame me? I mean, she was talking about wanting to kill herself all over again. And when she told me she didn't respond for so long because when I told her that I felt alone she got scared that it meant that I liked her more than just as a friend. At first when she said that I felt disgusting. At first because everything I did backfired and I just ended up making her even more stressed when all I ever wanted to do was help make her feel good about herself.

And then I felt disgusting because after everything, after over a year of messages almost every morning, after hearing how she doesn't think she'd even still be alive if I hadn't helped her through it, after all the times she told me she'd always be there to return the favour if I ever needed it, the thought that I might see her as more than a friend was so bad that she suddenly forgot about it all. And I was left feeling utterly alone all over again.

And people wonder why I have a hard time talking about things, they wonder why I have low self confidence and why I always talk down about myself?

,depression,"Tl:dr sex is mediocre and I don't know why.

My parents went away for the weekend to visit my brother in college (I'm a junior for reference), i've never been caught doing anything irresponsible or illegal so they trusted me to stay by myself. I'm a lot more reckless and self destructive than they realize. I drive illegally (I only have my permit because of corona), fuck random girls every other week, and drink to the point where I'm concerned with myself. I don't complain to anyone about that tho, because its pointless and anyone who does isn't actually willing to change anything about themselves they're just taking out their frustration on their friends, distancing themselves from them. 

I'm bisexual, I think. I'm not out but I get turned on by both women and men. Now, I'm not even sure if I like men physically. I've had experiences with men, and it made me feel sick to my stomach, like disgusted. And I had the same experience last night, with my ex (girl). I've struggled with women to stay hard, I'm either really really horny and want to fuck the ever loving shit out of them, or completely numb head to toe. I can't put myself in the mood, and its fucked up a lot of hookups. Same has happened with guys, but less frequent. 

My ex is a virgin and I was one too when we dated so I was fine with taking it slow. She eventually told me she was molested as a kid, and I completely respected her wishes to not have sex until she was ready. We broke up before that could happen for other reasons, then reconnected a year later to be friends. She told me then she was ready and that I was the only person she was comfortable with. With my parents gone, I invited her to spend the night.

We had fun, went out to eat, watched tv, etc. There was a strong tension between us so I tried to break it by setting the mood and going for it. I wasn't horny, But I thought fuck it, maybe I'll get into it after we make out. I got into a semi after giving her head, had her blow me, then hard, I tried to stick it in but she was really closed off. Then instant flaccid. I could tell we both weren't into it, so we stopped. later in the night we took a shower together and tried again but it wouldn't go in. 

We went to bed after getting ice cream and in the morning I felt the same disgust.

Sex overall makes me feel disgusted with myself and I don't know why. I honestly feel better watching porn than I ever have with sex. Like the finish is better with sex but having hour long sex just feels mediocre at best.

I drive illegally (I only have my permit because of corona), fuck random girls every other week, and drink to the point where I&amp;#39;m concerned with myself. I don&amp;#39;t complain to anyone about that tho, because its pointless and anyone who does isn&amp;#39;t actually willing to change anything about themselves they&amp;#39;re just taking out their frustration on their friends, distancing themselves from them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m bisexual, I think. I&amp;#39;m not out but I get turned on by both women and men. Now, I&amp;#39;m not even sure if I like men physically. I&amp;#39;ve had experiences with men, and it made me feel sick to my stomach, like disgusted. And I had the same experience last night, with my ex (girl). I&amp;#39;ve struggled with women to stay hard, I&amp;#39;m either really really horny and want to fuck the ever loving shit out of them, or completely numb head to toe. I can&amp;#39;t put myself in the mood, and its fucked up a lot of hookups. Same has happened with guys, but less frequent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ex is a virgin and I was one too when we dated so I was fine with taking it slow. She eventually told me she was molested as a kid, and I completely respected her wishes to not have sex until she was ready. We broke up before that could happen for other reasons, then reconnected a year later to be friends. She told me then she was ready and that I was the only person she was comfortable with. With my parents gone, I invited her to spend the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had fun, went out to eat, watched tv, etc. There was a strong tension between us so I tried to break it by setting the mood and going for it. I wasn&amp;#39;t horny, But I thought fuck it, maybe I&amp;#39;ll get into it after we make out. I got into a semi after giving her head, had her blow me, then hard, I tried to stick it in but she was really closed off. Then instant flaccid. I could tell we both weren&amp;#39;t into it, so we stopped. later in the night we took a shower together and tried again but it wouldn&amp;#39;t go in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went to bed after getting ice cream and in the morning I felt the same disgust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex overall makes me feel disgusted with myself and I don&amp;#39;t know why. I honestly feel better watching porn than I ever have with sex. Like the finish is better with sex but having hour long sex just feels mediocre at best. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;god I wish I had viagra.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I've been depressed for years.  I have been trying to fix myself, to improve, but I'm pretty sure I don't have it in me to improve.  I have had every opportunity afforded to me.  I have no excuses for my mental shortcomings, or for my character flaws in general.  This is the most comfortable I've gotten with my own death before.

For a long time I was too afraid to end my life even though I wanted it ended.  But now I have found a method I think I can manage.  I don't want to put my family or friends through grief, but continuing to live as a failure, leaning on others, unable to exit my spiral, would just cause drawn out annoyance/pestering/burden/hardship on the people around me. Better to just rip the bandaid off.  Face the facts, own up to the eventuality and stop stalling. 

The planet is incredible, beautiful, a miracle.  It's almost unbelievable that life exists and that we're able to be conscious of the experience.  The fact that I struggle every day to find a purpose to get out of bed, to kick my butt into gear and work as hard as everyone else, to make the sacrifices and commitments it takes to support myself.  That shows I don't belong here.  I don't deserve this, I haven't earned it.

Three months ago I met someone.  We started seeing each other, we were mutually attracted, we get along well, we've been getting more and more connected.  And even though when I'm with them I just want to feel held, happy, and heard, instead I am constantly intruded with reminders that this person only likes me because I've been putting up all my good sides.  They don't know how much rot and stench is beneath the facade.  They don't know how utterly unable I am to be a stable, reliable, supportive partner.  It breaks my heart now when I'm with this person.  I have decided just to savor each moment I'm able to be with them as if it will be the last, because the last isn't far off.  I've already intentionally avoided letting things get more serious or committed because I know I ought to taper things off and explain I can't be who they want me to be.  I wouldn't keep stringing them along with false promises while I'm aware of the expiration date.

I am not in financial ruin, and that's basically the only thing keeping me from exiting sooner.  I am only taking from my savings, I know I'm not able to add to them.  But even though I know where I'm headed, so long as I am using up my own savings I feel like I can justifiably stick around.  So long as I have some money to pay rent and feed myself, I feel like I can be here a little longer.  Once I can't do that, there is no way I could live with myself relying completely on family/others for a roof over my head, food, etc.  That's just unacceptable.  I am so far past the point where those things are my responsibility.  So, after going through the holidays one last time, when it comes to january and there's yet again nothing to look forward to, I think that would be the time to go.  

My parents will be really devastated.  They put in so much of their lives, their energy, their resources to raising me.  only for me to end up a complete failure who can't produce valuable effort and bring in resources for myself or the family.  It's not fair to them at all.  My siblings will also probably be really sad, though not as much as my parents.  I think after a year or so they will be able to go about life more or less normally.  They are already in great financial standing, so there's no way it would push them over the edge of being able to live comfortably.  

I really have no idea if my friends will be hit with grief.  I don't have many.  Being so bad at caring about myself, I never made for a very good friend myself, so I don't blame them for not sticking around.  Why should they?  

None of my exes will be bothered much.  The one that accurately told me I needed help and should see a therapist already knows they were right.

I had a lot of great times in my life.  I have lots of memories I can selectively look back on and smile.  I got to see so many amazing sunsets and wide open wilderness areas.  I have listened to so many hours and hours of music.  It might be the thing I'll miss the most.

,depression,"Contrary to popular perception, depression is not sadness- infact it is the normalcy of sadness and pain. It is a feeling that appears like numbness but in actuality is one resisting something that they think they need to hide.

Being the youngest family member, I was always told to respect elders and not show any emotion which in their eyes was 'inappropriate'. I was told that if I scored good marks I'll be a worthy enough human and will get respect. I quietly suffered abuse at the hands of my elder sister because I thought that is what good kids do and developed chronic depression as a result.

Here I want to tell you something you may have heard for the first time- ALL EMOTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE, VALID, PERFECT AND WORTHY OF EXPRESSION. THERE IS NO 'WRONG' FEELING. I used to be ashamed of the rage I felt towards my family because I thought that it's wrong to feel like that about your own blood. But today, I decided to be UNCONDITIONALLY LOVING TOWARDS MYSELF, THE WAY A MOTHER IS TOWARDS HER CHILD. I allowed each emotion, from rage, sadness, resentment and revenge (yes all the ugly ones)  to flow through me. 

As I did that, I felt a strong feeling of connection well up within me- for the first time I FELT LIKE I MATTERED. There was nothing to hide or be ashamed about, I was deserving of better treatment and the motherly side of me totally validated that opinion. I then calmed down and began seeing the world from a much lighter perspective.

Today, do yourself a favour and be kind to yourself. If you came on this planet, you are WORTHY BY DEFAULT. Sit down with a pen and a paper and be emotionally naked with yourself, allow each and every thought and emotion to flow unabashedly from pen to paper. As you allow each emotion to wash over you like water from a sea, offering no resistance whatsoever, you will find yourself heal and rise above that emotion.",t2_5j3ywtfa,False,,0,False,All emotions are valid and allowed,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_jh6xw5,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603565408.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular perception, depression is not sadness- infact it is the normalcy of sadness and pain.

I was told that if I scored good marks I&amp;#39;ll be a worthy enough human and will get respect. I quietly suffered abuse at the hands of my elder sister because I thought that is what good kids do and developed chronic depression as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I want to tell you something you may have heard for the first time- ALL EMOTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE, VALID, PERFECT AND WORTHY OF EXPRESSION. THERE IS NO &amp;#39;WRONG&amp;#39; FEELING. I used to be ashamed of the rage I felt towards my family because I thought that it&amp;#39;s wrong to feel like that about your own blood. But today, I decided to be UNCONDITIONALLY LOVING TOWARDS MYSELF, THE WAY A MOTHER IS TOWARDS HER CHILD. I allowed each emotion, from rage, sadness, resentment and revenge (yes all the ugly ones)  to flow through me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I did that, I felt a strong feeling of connection well up within me- for the first time I FELT LIKE I MATTERED. There was nothing to hide or be ashamed about, I was deserving of better treatment and the motherly side of me totally validated that opinion. I then calmed down and began seeing the world from a much lighter perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, do yourself a favour and be kind to yourself. If you came on this planet, you are WORTHY BY DEFAULT. Sit down with a pen and a paper and be emotionally naked with yourself, allow each and every thought and emotion to flow unabashedly from pen to paper. As you allow each emotion to wash over you like water from a sea, offering no resistance whatsoever, you will find yourself heal and rise above that emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"T.W - Physical abuse

I have been physically and mentally abused, since I was a kid. I still remember what it felt like. I can still feel my skin, bleeding and hurting even though it had been years, since this happened, but i cant forget it.  Always have been abused by my mother. Almost by everyone, but mostly, my mother. The pain, the abuse, and what not, still haunts me every fucking day. The pain I have been thru, is unimaginable. Will this ever get better? 

My friends say that something good is waiting for me, and i really wonder if there is actually something good or not, lol. I used to be vv optimistic but I gave up, cause I can't take this anymore. The trauma, the flashbacks, the pain. It haunts me every single day. I never had anyone touch me with love, or with kindness.

&lt;p&gt;I have been physically and mentally abused, since I was a kid. I still remember what it felt like. I can still feel my skin, bleeding and hurting even though it had been years, since this happened, but i cant forget it.  Always have been abused by my mother. Almost by everyone, but mostly, my mother. The pain, the abuse, and what not, still haunts me every fucking day. The pain I have been thru, is unimaginable. Will this ever get better? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friends say that something good is waiting for me, and i really wonder if there is actually something good or not, lol. I used to be vv optimistic but I gave up, cause I can&amp;#39;t take this anymore. The trauma, the flashbacks, the pain. It haunts me every single day.

,depression,"I just want to head this off by saying, yes: I was posting desperate stream of conscious rambles on r/SuicideWatch 3 days ago. I'm definitely not cured. I will probably do that again soon. I don't even feel good, I still fucking hate myself, I'm still on the verge of tears for no reason, I still didn't do a good job at my job today and I deserve to be fired, I still was an absentee friend and relative to everyone I love, my house is still a mess. But I'm trying so goddamn hard and I have nobody to brag about this to except here. I haven't told any of my friends or family even a little bit about how I am, they don't even know I'm depressed at all, probably lots of people assume I have anxiety because it's obvious but the depression I hide well. I haven't told my therapist how bad I am because I don't want to get 5150'd, I've been trying hard at therapy but acting like my feelings are only 65% of what they are. I probably am only able to express this kind of levity right now because I am high, a last hurrah of sorts before I take a break from weed for contraindication reasons. 

Something shifted for me today. I remember back a few months ago, when ""the shift"" from being passively suicidal to actively suicidal happened. It was a really scary moment for me. I'd been passively suicidal for years but the moment I realized it had actually become a hatching plan I intended to do soon rather than an abstract idea that I'll probably do one day, that moment slapped me in the face. I kind of just had that in reverse today?

I still hate myself. I still want to kill myself, I am still thinking about it a lot, I am still absolutely fucking miserable. I want nothing more than to not exist anymore. But something in my brain shifted back today and it once again feels like a thing I'll probably end up doing after a few more decades of suffering, not something I'm meticulously planning and researching for later this week. I don't feel an overwhelming urge to finish editing my suicide notes by a particular deadline right now.

I was so close you guys. I had been staying alive for months on the notion that my house was too messy and my affairs too out of order and it would be embarrassing to die and have my loved ones discover that I did not have my life as together as I seemed to. I understand how insane this sounds but it was a real thought process that kept me alive for months. I didn't want to disappoint them. Then a couple weeks ago, that part of me snapped too. That last defense mechanism broke, and I decided it didn't matter, the urgency I felt about needing to die outweighed the guilt for not being able to outlive my dad and the discomfort of knowing I couldn't clean up my life enough to shield my loved ones from the truth about me - that I'm mentally ill. Really that's the whole truth. I didn't do anything bad to anyone but myself, I just didn't want them to see how I've been living or the fucked up things I've been googling or the really stupid financial decisions I've been making. I wrote another note, this one I titled An Explanation. I wrote individual notes to everyone I've ever cared about, so there are a lot of them. This one was the longest one by far, and the hardest to follow, just pages and pages of me trying to explain why I feel the way I feel and trying to justify my decisions in the eyes of the people who would read it. In that note I tried to explain myself, and I explained away the messy house, the fact that I was lying and bullshitting at work and hadn't done half of what I've claimed to lately, the fact that I knew my friends would all come together and talk about me and find out that I literally haven't been talking to anyone or leaving my house -- they all thought I was busy with each other, or with work, or with other obligations. I was just busy with depression and lying to everyone, relying on the fact that my life is heavily compartmentalized so I can get away with making excuses. I didn't expect to be forgiven for any of this, I just wanted it to be explained, I hated thinking about people wasting their time wondering about me or trying to figure out what went wrong. 

And then I was ready. My things were as in order as they were going to be and I was ready. I still hesitated, but in more practical ways now, not out of fear. Did I feel bad for missing the holidays, could I try to make it til January? Maybe. Was I kind of curious to wait for the outcome of the election? Sure. Should I wait til after this heat wave, in case people don't find out for a few days, so my pet isn't stuck in my hot apartment? Yes. Would I be leaving my coworkers in a lurch if I did it this weekend rather than next? Fine, what's one more week of hell. But the point is that I had decided I was doing it soon. On bad days I drove to the bridge with only my ID, family contact information and instructions to find my notes, will, and key to my house, and an apology note to the coast guard for having to deal with my body all in a dry bag secured inside my clothes. One time I walked across and stood there gathering my thoughts for a few moments until a person came along and I worried he would talk to me so I kept moving. Other times I didn't even make it there because I was crying so hard I couldn't see where I was driving, and I didn't want to hurt anyone but myself so I would pull over. Many of my suicide attempt attempts in the last few weeks have ended sobbing in random parking lots. 

I just needed to work up a little more nerve to overcome that guilt but I couldn't seem to do that. I got so scared by the idea of someone seeing me on the bridge or a cop pulling me over for driving badly on my way there and getting 5150'd before I could do it. The thought of my friends and family finding out that I'm a disaster before I'm too dead to care about it is my worst nightmare. 

I started having more crying spells, I spend hours sobbing every single day. Every morning I wake up at 6am and sob for 3 hours before I can even think about getting out of bed and starting work. I frequently have to hold back tears in mundane conversations with people because my default state became crying.

I decided if I was going to be a little bitch about killing myself in a timely manner I should at least get this shit under control, so I made an appointment with a psychiatrist to try some pills. In the week leading up to my appointment I noticed that I was thinking about some really dark shit when I was sobbing, stuff I never thought about or could put into words when I was in an even slightly happier place. So I started making whiny voice memos and notes on my phone whenever I felt like I had an idea. Most of them were garbage but some were really insightful and things I think I should explore in therapy. When I was in a slightly more stable state I picked out all the relevant information and cleaned it up, removed the suicide stuff and the particularly dramatic depressive things so she wouldn't be suspicious and emailed it to my therapist. I've been in therapy for months, and I truly feel like we're accomplishing *something* so I stick with it, but I'm not sure what exactly we are accomplishing because I've still wanted to kill myself this whole time. But something is happening in my brain for sure, just not enough. But the point is, I was *trying* this time, and I was trying while in an unstable, acutely suicidal spiral. This was progress. Making the appointment with the psych was progress. I told my therapist about the appointment and we talked about my email and she seemed to see those things as progress too, and she said she appreciated my email because it helped her understand me more and I should keep sending more emails if I think of more things. I felt encouraged, I don't know, that's cheesy but for once I was trying really hard to get better and it felt good to have that seen. That thing that shifted, shifted back. I still want to kill myself, I still imagine it, but I don't feel a pressing need for it to happen right now. I can even almost entertain the idea of waiting a few decades for my parents to die so they don't have to live through that, which is what my plan has been for my whole life up until a few months ago.

Then this morning I had the psych appointment. I was 65% honest with my doctor in the same way as with my therapist, told him how I was feeling, right up to the line that would keep him from being concerned about anything. He prescribed an antidepressant and I'm really excited to start taking it in the morning. 

I will probably never tell my friends or family how I feel, but I got closer today than I ever have. To one friend I just expressed that I've been ""in a rut"" lately, which is more than I've ever admitted to anyone, and knowing him he's going to check in on me at some point because I said that. To another friend, one who I know has mental health issues too so would be cool about it, I casually dropped that I was starting an antidepressant. I implied it was for moderate depression or anxiety or something nonthreatening and didn't even hint that it was anywhere this severe, but still, more than I've ever told anyone. I know these tiny baby disclosures are not impressive and so many people come clean to their families and confide in them and cry together, but I'm not that kind of person and this is the best I can do. 

I know I'm only feeling better temporarily because I feel better temporarily once or twice a week most weeks. And because I'm smoking weed right now. And I understand that being passively suicidal and filled with so much self-loathing that I'm literally overflowing and will have panic attacks and crying spells throughout the day to relieve the pressure is not most people's idea of ""feeling better."" 

But I feel like the fact that I made some real moves to fix my brain while I have this slight amount of energy and clarity is an achievement. And the fact that in such a dark moment I found the presence of mind to make myself notes to look back on later, I feel like that means something, I've never done anything like that before. I don't know, I don't have and probably will never have big gains to share, and the chances that I'm going to be distraught and posting suicidal rambles again in a few days are high, but I'm starting to feel like something might be changing for me.",t2_6y2qc6an,False,,0,False,"I made the tiniest, saddest little amount of progress.

I&amp;#39;m definitely not cured. I will probably do that again soon. I don&amp;#39;t even feel good, I still fucking hate myself, I&amp;#39;m still on the verge of tears for no reason, I still didn&amp;#39;t do a good job at my job today and I deserve to be fired, I still was an absentee friend and relative to everyone I love, my house is still a mess. But I&amp;#39;m trying so goddamn hard and I have nobody to brag about this to except here. I haven&amp;#39;t told any of my friends or family even a little bit about how I am, they don&amp;#39;t even know I&amp;#39;m depressed at all, probably lots of people assume I have anxiety because it&amp;#39;s obvious but the depression I hide well. I haven&amp;#39;t told my therapist how bad I am because I don&amp;#39;t want to get 5150&amp;#39;d, I&amp;#39;ve been trying hard at therapy but acting like my feelings are only 65% of what they are. I probably am only able to express this kind of levity right now because I am high, a last hurrah of sorts before I take a break from weed for contraindication reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something shifted for me today. I remember back a few months ago, when &amp;quot;the shift&amp;quot; from being passively suicidal to actively suicidal happened. It was a really scary moment for me. I&amp;#39;d been passively suicidal for years but the moment I realized it had actually become a hatching plan I intended to do soon rather than an abstract idea that I&amp;#39;ll probably do one day, that moment slapped me in the face. I kind of just had that in reverse today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still hate myself. I still want to kill myself, I am still thinking about it a lot, I am still absolutely fucking miserable. I want nothing more than to not exist anymore. But something in my brain shifted back today and it once again feels like a thing I&amp;#39;ll probably end up doing after a few more decades of suffering, not something I&amp;#39;m meticulously planning and researching for later this week. I don&amp;#39;t feel an overwhelming urge to finish editing my suicide notes by a particular deadline right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so close you guys. I had been staying alive for months on the notion that my house was too messy and my affairs too out of order and it would be embarrassing to die and have my loved ones discover that I did not have my life as together as I seemed to. I understand how insane this sounds but it was a real thought process that kept me alive for months. I didn&amp;#39;t want to disappoint them. Then a couple weeks ago, that part of me snapped too.

I'm 31 years of age and I was diagnosed with depression at age 15. I do not take medication regularly as I often do not have the motivation to see my therapist or psychologist to get my prescription renewed. I grew up poor and socially awkward and now I have broken free of those chains. I am by no means rich (lower class at best), but I feel that my life is great. I have a house, two cars, a wife, and a great support system. I just got a promotion at work and I'm working harder than I ever have. That having been said, I still often wonder if it would be better if I were to disappear. I often feel like the day to day life I'm living isn't mine. Almost as if the person I am is not me. I would liken my existence to being a side-character in my own life or like a bystander watching someone else live my life. I've willpower to spare and I've not given up thus far, but there is a weight I carry that I don't know how to describe with words. There is a palpable emptiness in me and every achievement I gain feels like a hollow victory. I'm missing crucial a piece of myself and I fill that space with work, social interaction, and personal missions of productive conquest but to no avail. Sometimes I feel like a void that consumes good things but constantly hungers for more. I fear that it will never be enough for me. I trudge through life unable to be proud of anything I have. Some days I will wake up, go to work, accomplish everything I set out to do, come home to my wife of 7 years (I am still madly in love with her), and have a beer before cuddling her until she falls asleep... however, once she does, I am back in the pit with nothing to distract from this all consuming void that is the missing piece of me. It feels pathetic. Would she still love me if she knew that I am constantly and consistently unhappy with everything we've built together? She knows I have depression, but would she understand that she is not enough to stop my mental illness? I don't think I deserve her and the same goes for my friends. I feel like a fraud. The person that they find so appealing is just a façade I've invented to insure that they are never worried about me. I act outwardly like a stalwart pillar of support and ray of sunshine for those around me and any weakness I show might make them lose confidence in the support that I show them. Sometimes I let a bit of my real self through and I feel ashamed for having burdened my friends with the weight of my problems. I yearn for oblivion, and yet I must always press forward. How I wish I could quit. I often hope I go to sleep and don't wake up. I've fantasized about and even planned my suicide on several occasions since I was 12, but I have not gone through with it. I am not sure whether it is because I am cowardly or because this empty piece won't let me die until I fill it with whatever it is that fits there. I'm so ashamed that I have so much that many have and would kill for, yet it isn't enough. It's almost as if my life is a long joke and I'm the punchline. I really just didn't know who to talk to about this (aside from my therapist... obviously). I guess I'm just tired of feeling alone in a crowded room and wondered if anyone else felt the same. Please feel free to tell me about your experiences like this if you have any as it would really help me feel like I'm a little less broken of a person by knowing that there is someone who feels similarly. I'm just going to leave this here as I have work and many other things to get done today, but I'll be back to see any responses later on tonight.

,depression,"I have posted this in other groups, but I thought I’d ask for advice here as well, bc I feel like y’all would maybe be able to relate on some level

Let me start out by saying, I (17M) have severe Paranoid Personality Disorder. There’s this guy I go to school with, Let’s call him A. A and I are sort of friends, like we’ll say hello when we walk past each other, but nothing much else. 

A is having a party tonight, and I just found out he invited my entire friend group, except me. Most of my friend group don’t like A at all, but they’re going anyway. A invited my best friend (who hates him) my girlfriend (who is good friends with him, so that’s understandable) and 5 of my other friends, each of whom don’t really know him. 

My paranoia is making me believe he’s singled me out. He told my girlfriend he was going to invite her friends so that she’ll have people to talk to, but he doesn’t invite me. My most of my friend group, including my girlfriend, don’t see the problem, and to be honest, that hurts. I know I sound like a bratty little kid, but I know I’m going to see stories on Snapchat of all the fun they’re having, and it’s going to negatively impact me, and I don’t know what to do.

This whole situation is obviously making me jealous. Being left out doesn’t feel great to anyone, but that, coupled with my paranoia, is going to make me feel even more jealous than usual.

The party is in like 15 minutes, and I know that seeing all my friends together having fun without me, at the party of someone they don’t even like, is going to hurt me mentally, and I don’t know what to do to stop thinking about it. In the past I have had to miss events my group has organised, and every time, I have cried seeing them having the time of their life (I’m a sensitive guy anyway, and the littlest things make me cry, so please forgive me lmao). 

I’ve already spoken to my best friend about the situation (I’m not going to mention it to my girlfriend, because she always thinks I’m being over dramatic with things like this) and he agreed that it’s a shitty thing to do to someone, and he’s offered to ask A what that’s all about, so we’ll see.

Anyway, to bring things to a close, does anyone have any advice on how I can stop feeling jealous in this situation? I would love to be able to just not look at Snapchat or Instagram, and avoid al the videos of the fun, but I’m going to inevitably open it in the morning, so I’ll see them anyway.

I would love to be able to just not look at Snapchat or Instagram, and avoid al the videos of the fun, but I’m going to inevitably open it in the morning, so I’ll see them anyway. But right now I just feel helpless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is a mess, so I apologise, but thank you in advance for your help 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

Hi.

My mental health is at an all time low right now, and the current job that I'm at now exasperates my depression, and has been for a while (I work at an assisted living facility).

I know two weeks notice is customary and the best things to do, but the thought of working another shift after my work week ends makes me panic and want to cry. I know myself enough that if I worked another shift I wouldn't be doing the best thing for myself and it would be unfair to the consumers I assist.

My question is, how do I get across to all my managers + schedulers that I'm leaving so suddenly not for the fun of it, but because my mental health and stability depends on it, while staying professional? And how do I get rid of that guilt that I feel leaving all the coworkers and managers and consumers that I love behind, as well as the guilt of knowing that they'll be scrambling to cover my shifts since we're pretty understaffed?

,depression,"I used to be able to articulate why I was upset or how I felt in general but I don't think I know how anymore.

I just turned 20 a few days ago. It was a shitty birthday and I've learned to hate birthdays. It's something about feeling entitled to happiness for just one day and not obtaining it. This was my upbringing. I grew up in an abusive household and I always thought (back when I believed in God) that God would stop the abuse for one day a year, if I prayed hard enough. It never did.

Today my friend insisted on having a ""party"" of some sort for my birthday. I said okay because I thought it would make her happy. She brought her ex girlfriend over and my boyfriend was at work. They flirted the whole way through and eventually I just smoked some pot, stopped interacting, and started debugging some Assembly code. Eventually they took the cue that they should leave.

I guess I want to talk to someone about feeling shitty. About trauma. About all the shit in life. But looking through my contacts there's no one. And even if there were, what the hell would I say? ""Sorry for wasting your time, but I'm sad""? Or should I say, ""I'm sad"" but without the apology, or should I say that I just want to rant? People are busy. I'm good at keeping my shit together. It's not like any of my feelings change any outcomes in life.

My SO used to be a good person to talk to about this shit. As are all new relationships that I've ever had. I think that men think I'm pretty so they put up with more baggage near the start. As time goes on, they listen less and less. Not like they lose interest in me persay - my SO just moved 500 miles to be with me - but just that my sadness and my feelings aren't worth discussing. That we should just cuddle, have sex, and joke around.

I don't know how to talk. Part of me wants to cheat on my SO just to be listened to by a stranger. Another part of me realises that I can't afford to fuck up the little good that I have in my life.

It's difficult for me to act all happy and energetic now a days, and I can feel that I'm becoming a burden. I'm not sure if my parents and older sister knows or maybe they do but they just don't care at all.

I try so so so fucking hard to hide it just like before but it's just so difficult now. Can someone help me please. I don't want to be a burden. I know it's not healthy, yes. I just need to bottle em up and hide them properly and I'll be okay. I don't need anymore help when it comes to overcoming my depression.

In particular I've wanted to work with less fortunate students from lower income communities. I finally started my student teaching last semester and things were going great (or so I thought). Covid hit and things got cut short but we managed and so I went into this semester hopeful things would work out. Well they didn't and today things came to a head with me finding out the teacher I've been working with has been lying to my face telling me she's very happy with my work all while telling my supervisor the complete opposite. On top of that I've been called a liar when trying to refute the claims and even being told I ""must have deleted"" an email I never received.

I'm no stranger to tough times and depression and anxiety. In fact I only just stopped attending counseling about a year ago after an ordeal that nearly had me commit myself. However, no matter how bad it got there was always that small flame or voice or whatever deep down that told me ""keep going for the kids"". After today though that voice is gone. I don't care about helping students anymore. I don't want to keep being a punching bag just to save a couple kids who struggle. I have family and friends in education who have been telling me all day about times they put their careers on the line to help students and how it almost broke them but they kept going because they wanted to help those kids and I just don't get it anymore.

They tell me I'll face adversity in any profession, and they're right, but at least in another profession if make more money. Why should I keep going in a profession where I'm not respected, treated like dirty, and paid peanuts when I can't even bring myself to care?

Idk I'm just so broken. I've felt depression that kept me from being able to get out of bed, I've had crippling anxiety that caused me to be hospitalized, but I've never felt the sort of hate and lack of hope I feel now. I've been moved to a new school with a new cooperating teacher but I honestly don't even care. The thought of continuing to become a teacher fills me with nothing but disgust in all the wasted years and dollars I put into this degree. Honestly if not for that money and being so close I'd just drop it now and move on to something else.

College was a mistake and I hate myself for listening to those that encouraged me to go, but most of all I hate myself for ever thinking that this path was worth it. I should've listened to my friends who told me to go with the money rather than wanting to make a difference.

,depression,"Dear A,

We met almost a year ago now. I remember searching for therapists online and then coming across your profile. You seemed open minded. Things weren’t working out with my previous therapist. I desperately needed help. My emotions were consuming me. I couldn’t go through this alone. I’m so glad I made the decision to reach out to you. This past year has not been an easy road. I often feel like a difficult client because I never seem to get better. You never make me feel like one though. Ive wanted to give up so many times in the last year. I try to convince myself the therapy isn’t working or I am a lost cause. But I keep coming back. At the end of each appointment you always have me schedule another one for the next week and I keep coming back. I always wait and expect you to say maybe I should look elsewhere, but that never happens. You stick with me. You’ve helped me realize that I see the world through a black and white lens. My brain has a tendency to view things as all good or all bad. I struggle to see the gray area. This affects almost every area of my life. Even in therapy it makes it hard. You never shame me. You’ve helped me realize I put a lot of shame on myself. You remind me that I deserve to be happy and to be treated well by others. These may seem like small things, but I truly didn’t feel I was worthy of love and respect. A year ago I would have had no courage to set boundaries because I was afraid of upsetting people. You made me realize that I didn’t deserve to be sent away to boarding schools as a child. I always thought I was inherently bad and kind of just messed up by nature. You remind me over and over again that I am not broken. I look forward every week to talking with you. You give me a time to get things off my chest. Sometimes your advice doesn’t click right away but will later on. It’s been a year and I’m not in remission by any means, but I know so much more about myself. I am beginning to notice my mind’s habit of going down the rabbit hole. You are there for me week after week. You sit the whole hour and listen to me even when a lot of the time I’m not doing well. You didn’t have to be a therapist. You could have picked some other job where people aren’t laying their burdens all over you everyday. I am so thankful for you. Because of you, I didn’t have to go through all of this alone this past year. You inspired me to try mindfulness. When I can get myself to practice, I feel a little better and more clear minded for a bit. Same with journaling. I’m still at the beginning of my healing journey. I’m learning it’s not an easy fix and you remind me that is okay. It is okay to have good and bad weeks. It is okay to sit with my emotions. I don’t need to live in shame.

,depression,"
I am not suicidal, I know this life is too much of a privilege and it would be a disservice to those living and dying, by ways out of their control, to prematurely take my own life. It would inadvertently affect others in a way I know I could not do, not to mention the thought of doing something like that is scary. 

However, I definitely don’t care if I have any time left on this planet. I really don’t enjoy anything, and I feel like I hurt those around me more than I help them. I think I may defect to a mountainside and live out my days on a garden and some ingenuity. At least from this perspective I see less pain. Not for myself but for the world around me. Leaving the rest of the living so that they must not carry the burden of myself on their shoulders any longer. 

Resilience is of priority, as with all things in life, but I have given myself too much credit, and have been too far from critical of my own actions or reasonable about my impact on my loved ones. With recent situations bringing to light the flaws of my character in a way I’ve never more clearly understood, it seems the scars may run too deep to ever recover in a meaningful way.

It would inadvertently affect others in a way I know I could not do, not to mention the thought of doing something like that is scary. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I definitely don’t care if I have any time left on this planet. I really don’t enjoy anything, and I feel like I hurt those around me more than I help them. I think I may defect to a mountainside and live out my days on a garden and some ingenuity. At least from this perspective I see less pain. Not for myself but for the world around me. Leaving the rest of the living so that they must not carry the burden of myself on their shoulders any longer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resilience is of priority, as with all things in life, but I have given myself too much credit, and have been too far from critical of my own actions or reasonable about my impact on my loved ones.

I've known this friend for just under 3 years now and I know she has depression, anxiety and CPTSD.

Unfortunately, I myself been in a pretty fortunate position where before a short 2 years career depression, I'm pretty normal.

I've tried to read and understand about depression but I believe her depression is rather unique.. it's less a 'positional depression' and rather, a 'environmental/society' depression.. what I mean by that is this -

She feels the people in the world could be better but they choose not to.  She hates how the world is going with this selflessness but is depression cause she needs to partake in this mockery of existence.

Here the issue thought 
- I've tried to understand but I can't and I know providing solutions is slowly driving us apart
- she's now met someone (b) whom, I believe, due to her (b) own history, is more sensitive towards what she's going thru and I can see the friendship getting stronger and stronger and the 3 years we've been together is now basically, disappearing before my eyes.
- when I visit, we normally go driving to get food and we'll chat and she'll sit close to me.  Lately, she's pretty up pressed up against the door and seriously, if I open the door, she'll fall out.

I know this sounds like a relationship question but the reason I'm asking in here..

People who are depressed, friends that you've known for 3 years.. do you find them easily replaced if they are unable to understand your situation and someone else come along who can?.

,depression,"So I’ve been struggling a lot lately, although I know many people, especially in recent months, have suffered much much worse than me. I’m in high school, and I’ve recently moved (although only 20 minutes away). Since lockdown started in the spring, I literally haven’t heard from any of my friends. At first I thought, you know, everyone’s having a hard time, I’m not going to judge them or take it personally. Then on their social media they post first zoom or FaceTime chats, then in person activities they’re doing together. And I’m not in on any of it. Fair enough, I hadn’t really reached out. I reach out, like “hey! How’ve you been? It’s been awhile since we talked!!” And they’d answer blandly and leave me on read eventually. I do this a couple times before realizing they really don’t want to talk to me. So literally, since March, zero friends have reached out to me. I don’t think I have friends anymore. I thought they were my good friends, but now I’m not so sure. I hadn’t lived there too long, but I’ve moved way too many times in my life. At my new school, understandably, no one really wants to reach out. It makes sense. We’re hybrid, distanced, wearing masks, and they haven’t seen their friends in months. It makes sense they aren’t going to want to talk to the new kid. I’ve tried a couple times to talk to people, but often it results in a visible distaste for socializing with me. I hope it isn’t all in my head. I’ve moved countless times all my life, and I’ve never had any problems putting myself out there and making friends...I understand it but I don’t. It makes me feel like I’ve changed, or that no one really likes me. I literally have no one to talk to, and I feel a crippling loneliness. I’m on edge all the time, feeling depressed, and am almost always on the verge of tears. and therapy is not an answer for a multitude of reasons. I’ve always been a good student, but my motivation is completely down the drain, and I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. Most of my extracurriculars, including me being in leadership roles and captains of teams were lost when I moved schools. I would have to restart, but I’m already a junior. I was a 4.0 student and competitive for top schools... it’s what I have been working on for years as one of my life goals and it’s all slipping away so fast. The things that made me me, such as being funny, motivated &amp; smart, have gone down the drain. I feel like I’m not the same person anymore. I don’t know what to do.

I’m in high school, and I’ve recently moved (although only 20 minutes away). Since lockdown started in the spring, I literally haven’t heard from any of my friends. At first I thought, you know, everyone’s having a hard time, I’m not going to judge them or take it personally. Then on their social media they post first zoom or FaceTime chats, then in person activities they’re doing together. And I’m not in on any of it. Fair enough, I hadn’t really reached out. I reach out, like “hey! How’ve you been? It’s been awhile since we talked!!” And they’d answer blandly and leave me on read eventually. I do this a couple times before realizing they really don’t want to talk to me. So literally, since March, zero friends have reached out to me. I don’t think I have friends anymore. I thought they were my good friends, but now I’m not so sure. I hadn’t lived there too long, but I’ve moved way too many times in my life. At my new school, understandably, no one really wants to reach out. It makes sense. We’re hybrid, distanced, wearing masks, and they haven’t seen their friends in months. It makes sense they aren’t going to want to talk to the new kid. I’ve tried a couple times to talk to people, but often it results in a visible distaste for socializing with me. I hope it isn’t all in my head. I’ve moved countless times all my life, and I’ve never had any problems putting myself out there and making friends...I understand it but I don’t. It makes me feel like I’ve changed, or that no one really likes me. I literally have no one to talk to, and I feel a crippling loneliness. I’m on edge all the time, feeling depressed, and am almost always on the verge of tears. and therapy is not an answer for a multitude of reasons. I’ve always been a good student, but my motivation is completely down the drain, and I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. Most of my extracurriculars, including me being in leadership roles and captains of teams were lost when I moved schools. I would have to restart, but I’m already a junior. I was a 4.0 student and competitive for top schools... it’s what I have been working on for years as one of my life goals and it’s all slipping away so fast. The things that made me me, such as being funny, motivated &amp;amp; smart, have gone down the drain. I feel like I’m not the same person anymore. I don’t know what to do. I’m beginning to get desperate and think dangerously. I literally don’t know who I am, or what my traits are anymore. How can I find help?&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"(Before you begin to read, the title was to sorta of hook you in and get some sort of laugh)

For the past 2-3ish months it has been nothing but hell for me, and the only thing I do to escape is play video games, so I got online and I was waiting for an invitation to a party filled with people who I consider friends. I waited and waited so then I said screw it I’ll join manually. I don’t usually do that because I don’t like joining parties out of nowhere because I’m afraid of them not wanting me in there. I say “hi” and got no response like usually. Then the night went on as usual. They start talking and if I talk or put my two cents in about something my brother tells me to shut up and his friends and my friends gang up on me and I get insulted about stuff I did in the past (i did nothing bad to clarify, just mistakes) then I go mute for the rest of the night until someone acknowledges me then I say “hi” then it repeats.

Now a rather more specific situation that happened 4 days ago.

I was playing Minecraft and I was acting upset about everything and about what was going to happen to me probably. (I’m also a pessimist) my friend asks me “hey what’s wrong” and then I proceed to tell what has been going on. I say “hey you still here?” To check if they are still listening. *no response* I say “hello?” *still no response* I assumed she left to go do something without telling me that she had to go do something (which no one I know does that and I mean NO ONE) ,so I assumed that she didn’t care. 

I tried to talk to another friend, but they had stuff going on too so when that happens I bury my thoughts and feelings until the issue is resolved. I was expecting for him talk to me about it because we have done it before, but I still have no clue what is going on.

That friend had helped me in the past by telling me what my friends said behind my back and from what he told me that he was crying because he felt bad for me. I didn’t want to know what they were saying because I just wanted to play video games.

To rap up the rest of it because it is 2:46 AM for me 

My friend’s blame me for stuff I didn’t do, they insult me, they don’t talk to me on Snapchat; no one responds, I’ll join to talk to them, but they try to piss me off and get a chuckle out of it.

Anyways i feel like im a jester to them, I feel like they want to push me away, and to me they’re the only friends I have and if I don’t have them with me I’ll just be lonely like I’am 95% of the day. I don’t go outside I’m doing online school because I had a choice, I don’t get invited to things, and I feel im the last person someone thinks of.

They’re all I have left to talk, relate, and share my feelings with.

They’re all I have left

,depression,"I've lost interest in my hobbies, activities I once enjoyed, people I used to talk to and hang out with. I am realizing more and more that people are not really who you think they are. That all interactions are based upon some sort of special condition. There is no more unconditional love in this world. People are really fake and you can see it on their face and hear it in their voice. I am a grocery store worker, union job, in it for a long time. I've held many jobs over the years but working this job through Covid has been a nightmarish rollercoaster ride from the beginning. The worst. When you work for such jobs as this the management in these places sucks. Grocery stores attract the sort of ""misfits"" in life and often times straight up sociopaths and creeps. Let's just say I have not been well taken care of or respected through this by my employer, who is a very well respected name in the industry around here. Quite the opposite in fact they treat us like sh\*t even more so. I used to live together with my longtime girl friend who was the love of my life. Now I live alone, for the past 5-6 months I am alone pretty much all the time. She was the sunshine in my life. We did everything together. We went to bed together and woke up together everyday for 6 years.  we helped each other, we looked out for each other, we loved each other. I did her laundry every week, I got up at 5AM to make her coffee in the morning before she left for work when my shift did not start until 12 in the afternoon I would get up with her because I didn't want her to go out to her car alone in the dark and I wanted to help her with time on making the coffee. I did whatever I could to try to make her comfy and feel loved.  She was the reason why I kept going everyday, and plans for our future. well her and to take care of the damn dog. And that's really all I had at the end of the day. Sure I had hobbies and stuff, but none of that really matters to me. She was my family at this point in my life. Now I just have a dying dog at home who I am going to have to put to sleep soon due to old age. Her ex-boyfriend killed himself a few months ago from Vicodin and drinking bottles of liquor everyday because he was a coward and couldn't handle life anymore apparently and he decided he would just slowly drink himself to death and pop pills until he died at a young age. He still had his family here! I don't understand people like that! His mother, his father, brother, sister. It's a sad story really. But I don't understand, he took his family for granted. I wish I had my mother and father here by me still, gosh what I would do just to be able to sit with them one more time, just once.. This asshole had them all the time and was like oh poor me my life sucks wa wa wa. People suck. So much fake ness everywhere. No real integrity anymore. People even discount their own flesh and blood now days over some BS. The news of this loser dying shocked my girlfriend so much that she now couldn't handle life anymore so our relationship fell apart during his extensive time in the hospital and all that ensued with her from there on (not coming home anymore etc.) She became a completely different person and no longer cared about seeing me, texting me or answering my calls, or our dog, or coming home at all. She had told me once in tears that she had realized that she loved him still after she found out he was dying, but then later recanted that statement and then said it was only because she realized that she isn't fit to be in a relationship because she needs to work on herself now and be alone. But in reality it was that she wasn't over him yet and she finally realized that. She just didn't have the maturity level or the guts to tell me that herself. That was a major blow for me. That really took me down into the depths of depression. That coupled with our word being completely flipped upside down and shutdown due to covid was enough to put me into a state of numbing depression. I trusted her more than anyone in this world out of all the people I have ever known I was certain I could trust her. I was so sure. Boy was I wrong. This man was an overweight alcoholic thief (lost his job because he stole product regularly and finally got caught) that punched her in the face on more than one occasion yet she still wanted to run to his aide and she left me hanging. Thats why she left him when they were together. He beat her up in a drunken stupor. He was a real POS. I was 100% supportive of her doing whatever she wanted when we first found out about him being sick - sure go be with his family, help them, grieve , whatever you need  babe as long as you need I said. And she would be like ok thank you im sorry I love you ill be home. later... But eventually it turned into her falling out of love with me because she realized that she wasn't over him.

My dog is at the end of his life, after he goes I want to quit everything. I can&amp;#39;t do this anymore. Especially with the holidays approaching. Yeah fuck this shit. Not doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

I've learned over the years that I can do absolutely nothing to make them proud, cuz they would just tell me to don better to catch up to my siblings. I used to think that school was my sanctuary. My getaway to my home life that I couldn't tell anyone about. I used to have friends who i though actually cared for me, and when i opened up to them, they provided support. They did, they really did. This made school shine brighter to me.  I am currently a 9th grader and this all peaches and cream in grade 7, but then came grade 8. My two shining stars (lets call them 1 and 2) were as bright as ever and honestly, i thought it was perfect. until November. I have no idea to this day as to why she did what she did. My guess is that she got jealous, because me and 1 were starting to get really close. 2 did everything she could to drive a wedge between the two of us... and it worked. I remember how toxic it was and how hard it was to even talk to 1, she just wouldn't let go. 1 even said that 2 dropped the problem. Eventually, 1 gave into 2 lies and split off from me. I was devastated. If you don't know, here in Canada we have a rodeo system in which you stay with your class, but switch rooms. I remember being constantly glared at, and verbally abused, and i could do nothing about it because they hid it all. Eventually, I started to move away from those two and went to two of my best friends. I told them about the problem and one of them was supportive and the other one was sus. of me (Lets call them 3 and 4) 3 (the nice one said that I could have depression, so i relayed it onto 4. Then he started asking me about anti depressants and if i had any and all of that junk. Most of the time I didn't want to talk about it because first off, we are in the middle of class and second, I didn't have depression. So then he called me a liar. A fake. A phony and then blocked me. This was literally the day right before school got canceled due to covid. I was devastated. I don't know how many people he told that I was ""overreacting"" and that I ""lied"" about having depression. I wanted to die. Plus, now i had no safe space. I share a room with my brother because our house is small. And my brother, he's the worst person ever. I had to train my pre friends to act a certain way around him because he's a snitch and will do anything, ANYTHING from lying to flat stealing, get you in trouble. He also has a big problem with privacy and he's older than me. He also loves to argue because he always wins by cutting people off your hitting them. Obviously, my parents didn't care because if i were to tell them they would tell BOTH of us that they were sick of our fighting and we needed to man up.

He read all of my text messages. To my friends, about my life, projects, type of friends, this entire problem, my thoughts about him everything. To the bone. So now he's got a 1 up on me and I have to do everything he says. I'm stuck in a house with him too.

,depression,"Its important you guys know the backstory 1st. In middle school I met this girl. We soon became very close and became best friends and at one point we considered each other brother and sister. I had family issues at the time and was suicidal but she was there for me through most of it we would red each other back and fourth. She was there for me when I started cutting myself she was there for my on my 1st suicide attempt and I loved her more then anything on earth I would carry her stuff for her and comfort her when she went through a break up or was upset. I made a promise not to kill myself and to live for her sake as I cared about her so much I saw her as more then enough reason to live I loved her as if she was my sister.

Then high school came around and that's when it all fell apart. She started getting really agitated with me for no reason would just ignore me when she was around certain people and would try her best to avoid me. I would try to talk to her but she would just snap at me whenever I tried to talk to her about it. Finally after 3 months of putting up with the BS I just went off yelling at her the confrontation ended with me storming off that's all it was nothing more just yelling.

The rest of the school year was just pure hell as she had told everyone I was mentally abusing her and that I had her by the throat against the lockers. Because of this I was bullied both verbally and physically one time I was cornered in the boys bathroom and was beaten against the stall by one of her friends. I would constantly be insulted and made to feel guilty about shit I didn't even do to her. At one point she lied saying I tried to sexually assault her and the police got involved but they dropped the charges when they found out she was lying of course no punishment was given to her. 

It got to the point were I had to stay in class talking with the teachers who were the only ones who knew what was really going on after class and wait for everyone to pass in the hall as I was so scared of being beaten up or confronted. My now ex girlfriend broke up with me because she believed te girl over me. I had to switch schools the next year because I just couldn't deal with it any more I even attempted to overdoes on sleeping pills because of her.

But the torture continued as afterwards I was so traumatized by the incident that I developed PTSD over the situation if her name was even mentioned it would feel like my stomach would sink to the ground. I would also have panic attacks and mental breakdowns whenever I saw her again as even tho I changed school we still lived in the same general area. One time I was confronted by her boyfriend and he punched me in the face causing me to fall to the ground in the parking lot of the grocery store this was a year after the incident at that point. My own mother even said I couldn't be mad at her as since she was a girl in her own words ""I don't care what she did to you shes a women"" I wish I was joking. 2 years later and ive ran into her in public a few more times each time causes my PTSD and anxiety to act up causing me to go into a full blown panic attack. 2 years later and I'm still suffering from PTSD anxiety and severe depression from the incident. I recently downloaded discord but I signed into a old account and found the DMs my ex broke up with me with. This was enough to send me into a anxiety so bad I felt like I was gonna pass out me being an idiot reread all of them from start to end. 

Its left me with no friends no one to turn too my self esteem is practically nonexistent and the one person I loved more then anyone else on earth fucked me over in one of the worst ways possible and honestly I just don't see the point in life anyone I feel like my life is a waste like no ones ever gonna love me and I'm such a little bitch that just reading old DM messages is enough to set my anxiety and PTSD off I want her out of my life and out of my mind and I feel like deaths the only way to accomplish this I need someone to love someone who cares I don't know what else to do",t2_7h15dg2p,False,,0,False,I feel pathetic for this,[],r/depression,False,0,,0,,False,t3_jh4l1l,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1603551779.0,text,0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its important you guys know the backstory 1st.

Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening
BY ROBERT FROST

Whose woods these are I think I know.   
His house is in the village though;   
He will not see me stopping here   
To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

My little horse must think it queer   
To stop without a farmhouse near   
Between the woods and frozen lake   
The darkest evening of the year.   

He gives his harness bells a shake   
To ask if there is some mistake.   
The only other sound’s the sweep   
Of easy wind and downy flake.   

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
But I have promises to keep,   
And miles to go before I sleep,

,depression,Days just pass by at this point. Some nights I just hope to skip the next day. Everyday just gets worse and worse. I just lose friends left and right. I’m horrible at everything I do. No one is there for me to talk to. There too busy with Theirs life’s or I don’t wanna bother them with my problems. I don’t work or have a car I’m trapped everyday inside my house. All I can do is smoke bud or take sleeping pills. Music and video games the only 2 things I actually had fun with are just ass now a days. I have no one to share my bits of “ happiness “ with. The small friends I have left don’t give a fuck about what I say or talked about. I’m a nobody even to my own “ friends “. Most days I just wanna die.

,depression,"2011. We met during college time. Those wild, carefree days when everything was a possibility and my heart was unbroken still. 

She was the prettiest girl I'd ever seen. And once we started talking, I found out that she was fun to spend time with too. Intelligent and sexy. But she had a boyfriend. And I knew my limits and kept my distance. 

They broke up. She and I got close. We had our moments of lust, love and general fun. We dated. We broke up thrice over a period of 10 months of being together. Multiple fights, tears, restless nights, fervent prayers. Most of the times from my side more than hers. Jealous friends surrounded us all the time, her ex boyfriend butted in throughout to ruin things for us and well, she herself wasn't very helpful because of her second guessing her emotions or falling for other guys in my class. 

We broke up for the last time and I thought we'd get back again. College was over, there was no scope of meeting her again. So this breakup was easy for her. And well, we haven't met or spoken to each other since. This was just a brief overview of the turbulent relationship.

Now, the issue -

I was deeply, madly, truly in love with her. Heads over heels, suicidally, self destructively in love with her. I'd go crazy when she's around and crazier when she's not. I gave it all my heart and soul. She was the love of my life, mother of my kids, my lobster. And every few days she made me feel like a nobody. While eventually, I did feel like a nobody. When she didn't return. 

I kept all her memories with me. Her cards, gifts, letters. I have her pics and texts on cloud. There's a blog with articles about my memories of her. I've had several relationships after her but I guess I still love her. Deep down I want her back. 

I am able to hold my conscious self back and I distract myself with every other thought in the day time. But no matter what I do, there comes a time, one night in a period of 6 months, where she creeps up on me in my dreams. I am sleeping, innocently, having been a good boy in the day and waiting for the new day to come, while she visits me in my sleep. And well, it's messed up. 

I remember exactly how she looks like, even after 8 years and not having seen her since. I remember her long, flowy hair, her dark eyes, the three dots near her left eye, her thick eyebrows, her smile, her perfect teeth. I remember her voice and how she sounds. And the dream no longer feels like a dream. It feels so damn real. 

We have fun in the dream. The dreams are pleasant, sweet and she's always smiling in it. She's always mine in that dream. And when I wake up, usually I'm jolted back to reality, I get a shock of my life realising that it was just a dream. And now I'm back to reality. A reality without her. Where I've not heard from her since 8 years.

Why do the dreams seem so real? Why is she still stuck in my head? Why do I like these dreams and wait for them to happen? Why can't I conjure her in my dreams at will and enter a lucid dreaming state? Why can't I conjure her in my real life?

She has taught me how to stay apart from someone you love, how to walk away from a perfectly healthy relationship, how to hate someone. She has taught me to live alone. The heartbreak gave way to art, I write better now. And yet, she visits me at night, challenges my grasp on reality and puts my love to test. 

I have proven that I love you. It's your turn to come back and say that 8 years was just a phase.

,depression,"I'm just really tired.

I'm tired of drifting in and out of university, rarely ever being able to pass classes. But I have to keep trying because I'll be in an extra $15k debt (grants turn to debts when you drop out) with nothing to show for it. I'm on what will probably be my last chance with student loans right now, and I'm blowing it.

I'm blowing it because that's just what I do now. University was easy for a while, but then I started to struggle to cope with my gender. I've started sorting that out, but now I struggle to cope with having struggled to cope for so long. I've failed/withdrawn from so many classes.

I've tried not being in school. I've worked minimum-wage jobs because that's all I'm good for. I got fired from one and quit the other one to go back to school. I was actually pretty good at that second job but I hated it so much. I don't know what it's like to enjoy working.

I should feel lucky that I have a partner that I live with, and friends who seem to like me well enough. But I'm tired of trying to be a better person for them. I'm failing at that, so badly. It doesn't affect my friends much right now since we're all isolated from each other anyway, but it's messing my partner up. We both live with her boyfriend (poly stuff) since we couldn't afford living on our own, and I can't seem to make it work. I seem to have developed a bit of an anxiety/aversion to men, and I don't like leaving my room. Not to mention that I don't want to leave my room because I can't handle all the germs that I can't account for outside of it. My germaphobia was always a problem, but it's starting to become unmanagable. My wrists are cracked from dousing them in alcohol all the time (soap's not enough any more).

I'm trying to eat healthily, but I haven't left the house in over a week. I don't go outside. I barely move, really. I just don't have the energy to do anything any more. I need to get my overdue assignments done, and I'm running out of time. But I just can't fucking focus. I just can't do it. And when I try to, I get scared of screwing up my assignment. I get scared of being too stupid to figure out my animation programming coding or I'm scared of not being woke enough to write a reflection on gender in Indigenous culture. I'm sure it'd be fine if I just tried but I can't and I hate it.

I can't even waste time properly. I want to play video games, but I keep telling myself I'm going to get work done, so I just surf the Internet. I want to learn about Italian cooking, but I can't focus on the video I watch, and I know that if I tried cooking anything right now I'd start panicking and give up.

A couple of months ago, I was finding reading gay romance comics and shit was making me feel better, and it was helping me feel invested in being a good partner. Watching architecture videos gave me motivation to do better in life so that maybe some day I'll be able to do better than minimum-wage work for a company I actively despise. But it's not helping any more. Nothing's making me feel better and the suicidal thoughts are coming back. They're not all I can think about, but they're coming.

I tried shaving my legs tonight and it was almost nice... But I just feel too shitty otherwise for it to make a difference. I've been eating edibles for the past day or so trying to see if I can just feel anything, but they're not even affecting me. Which is strange, 'cause I'm usually extremely sensitive to weed. I don't know; maybe they're no good. But let's be honest, weed wouldn't help either... And I don't even feel like drinking, which is really unusual for me.

My sleep schedule is so fucked right now lol. I keep trying to reset it but because I'm not going outside my circadian rhythm is so confused. I woke up at 7 PM last night and will probably stay up to about 5PM. Which might temporarily help but it'll just go out of phase again.

I don't know sorry about the incoherent post. I don't even really have a point here I just feel generally shitty and I'm just so tired of it. I'm tired of being scared of everything, and I'm tired of having such fleeting moments of feeling good. I'm tired of finding everything gross. I'm tired of being too scared of germs to clean anything, leading to a messy house. I want a clean house. I want to do my schoolwork. I want to set up my electronic drums and keyboard and clean my trumpet and flute and find my bodhran beater and actually fucking learn to use a DAW and record some music but I just don't have the energy and feel like I'll be embarrassed of whatever I make anyway.

I don't know if this is a legit thing to be upset about or if I'm just overthinking things, but here's the stitch. I'm really starting to feel left out of the group of friends I have.

Now however, one specific person has given me reason to be more expressive and emotional, and that's my current girlfriend (20 female). She actually makes me care and life, where as before it was just.... There. We used to hang out a lot; we would call while I'm at work (I work at a place where I can be on the phone while I work), I would text her while she's at work, etc. This went the same for her roommate who she's best friends with, and I'm good friends with as well. We're all good friends... But an introduction to another person in our friend group made it a bit worse for me. Now, don't get me wrong. This dude is awesome! He's super happy all the time, very supportive of everyone, and makes people laugh. I have NOTHING against him in the slightest. It's just... Well, all they do is hang with him now. Like literally always. And that would again be fine if not for one thing. It's only with him. They don't invite me to hang anymore; I just sorta find out when I find them in a discord call (As a side note, he and I live on the east side of the US and they live in Canada). There are never messages in out little server inviting us all to hang in call with each other. They just dm him and ask him to hang with them. This has gone on for some time, but only today did it really hurt. They added a new channel to the server; 'game night', and all three of them were in it. I didn't know about it at all, but found out upon opening the server to play a little game on a bot. I don't like intruding on people, but I wanted in on this little game, so I joined in.

It didn't sound angry at all, made sense (I'm at work, so I technically can't PLAY any games with them, but I can still chat/listen to them) and I feel like her discord cut out something important cuz she stopped abruptly and she was silent for a bit, but it did hurt to hear.

,depression,"My husband left a toxic workplace because it was bringing his depression back. He’s rebuilding himself and organizing the house for the purpose of re-entering a new job with confidence. I’m 100% supportive of this. Our finances are stable and I would rather him put his mental health first. 

But let’s get to it. I’m self motivated and have no problem finding things to do. 

He feels lonely because I’m not home and works well when he has company. Since I’m the only one working, I can’t be home except later in the afternoon. As a result, he doesn’t feel motivated to do anything when he’s by himself. 

That’s what I’m struggling to understand. I know it isn’t laziness. I just don’t fully understand why he doesn’t feel motivated to work around the house more. Some days he does, some days he doesn’t. I’m also trying to figure out what I can do to help motivate him even if I’m not there. 


We also got into a bit of a spat this morning. We keep things civil, no cussing or name calling. I admitted my mistake (leaving the grill uncovered and forgetting about the storm) and called him out on some behavior I didn’t like. Dishes not being done when he said they were, being laughed at over not covering the grill at 5:30 in the morning. 

 He apologized and then shut down. Doesn’t want to talk to me or interact. Just wants to be left alone and I have no idea how long this is going to last. Longest was two days. I know this isn’t about me, but I feel like I should admit that it was really hard being without my best friend for two days. I took it really hard and spent those days crying and doing my best to keep it together at work. 

When your depression hits, why do you feel a complete lack of motivation? Do you feel tired? When you’re alone, does it get worse? 

I’m afraid this is going to last longer and I have no one to turn to. It’s become more frequent because my parents and his parents keep pointing out that he doesn’t have a job yet, amp other reasons.

Cant say that I've really achieved anything noteworthy during my lifetime(27 year old male). I did finish my bachelor's degree about two years ago, which at least gave some sort of joy and hope for the future. By doing that I proved to myself that I am capabable of seeing something through, instead of just dropping out and etching my education down as yet another in a long list of failures.

I landed my first job last October. It was actually the first job I had ever applied for, and it was in a field that suited my profile. However, it also involved ALOT of contact with small children and parents. The first of which I'm not a huge fan of. The place I worked was also located far away from my hometown. Which meant I had to get up at about 5 AM every morning to take a one and a half hour train ride, while also having to change trains in another city. The whole thing was a struggle. But I did what I could and went to work every morning. Only calling in sick two or three times due to being physically ill, not because of my mental health.

Anyway, about six months pass and  I'm called in to my bosses office. She told me that they weren't planning on extending my employment there(I had a six month probation period) . In a way I wasn't that surprised. I had underperformed. Partially because working so closely with children isn't really my cup of tea. And that sadly shone through in my work.

Having to figure out a lot of things by myself, or having my supervisor only pointing out stuff i was doing wrong, without having explained what I was supposed to be doing in the first place. So yeah, the lack of guidance didn't help.

As much I hated the job itself, or at least parts of it,  I do miss some of my colleagues.  It was actually a nice working environment. And I do feel I did do some good things while I was there, though my supervisor never gave me credit for it.

Six months have passed since then and I'm more depressed than I'v been in a looong time. My sleeping schedule is totally off. I mostly just lay in bed all day.

He was oddly charming as soon as he started talking, like when we both got in the car and he started driving and there was a song playing on the radio, he started singing along lol and was like ""I'm the only one that likes this song?"" I was like ""I do"" 

It's weird he never asked for my age, but I have a very young sounding voice but I'm literally a 22 yearold girl, I sound like I'm 10.

At some point in the game I told him I was 22, because he told me he was 31, after he told me his age he then said ""lots of people lie about their age, but I'm not ashamed""

Many things happened during this night that I met him, including the fact that he asked for my cellphone number at some point during me and him playing.
He called me after too, and kept telling me that I was an ""amazing beautiful person""

Also at some point in the game I told him i was molested as a child, I don't want sympathy, but he kept insisting that I have ""trust issues"" in the game, he kept telling me his last name in the game *which I dont believe is true*
Then he would ask my first name and middle name and last name, but in parts.

God he was so charming

I felt really close to him, like he cared about me
After he pestered me about my ""trust issues""
He said he has a psychology bachelors, and then I said wow that's impressive""
He said that maybe me and him were meant to meet that night

The thing hurts me is that I google reverse traced his photo and it was fake, he asked for my photo of my face and I gave it to him.
Funny enough he didnt believe my actual photo was me,
I sent him 2 face photos.

I even said ""hey maybe we can snapchat so I can prove to you it's me by snapping my face?""
He didnt want too, I'm sure Its because he didn't want to show his real face to me.

The thing here it was never sexual, it was just so weird, it wasnt love either 

It felt like I knew him my whole life but I just ignored him because I didnt believe he was real

That night he spoke to me on the phone he kept telling me that I should live, and live for myself, and that I'm ""too nice of a person"" to let my rapist make me feel like shit, he said I can live and have the life I want if I try.
I never told him I was depressed, but maybe he just assumed.

He sounded like he was going to cry on the phone that night, he said ""you're not saying anything"" I said ""what do I even say?""
He was like ""say you'll be a strong person""

He deleted me off the game app and stopped texting me, I think he did a final goodbye, he said that he hopes I get what i want from life and that I'll eventually be happy

Why did he send a fake photo?
Why did he ghost me?

,depression,"I’m writing this because I feel so fucking hopeless tonight and I feel like my peak years of happiness is wasted away because of factors I could never control or are out of my control now. This life has fucked me in too many ways imaginable. 

I’m in marching band and tonight was senior night which means the people graduating this get to go out on the football field with their parents and shit at halftime. It’s extremely baffling to me that this will be happening to me in exactly one years time. I’m not ready for shit and haven’t been prepared for shit. I’ve been wanting myself to grow up and be the person I’ve wanted myself to be all my life, and ever since I graduated freshman year, I’ve just wanted to stop time and sit in it forever. It’s extremely struggling to watch time fly in front of me and see my peers getting old while I’m gonna be the most underprepared and underskilled 18 year old there could possibly be. I’m watching the people I’ve “observed” become seniors and graduating while I’m right there with them now and can’t even remind myself on basic hygiene tasks (though there’s not much point to that anyways, since I’m not dressing or cleaning myself for anyone anyways). 

And even when senior day comes and I’m forced to get out on the football field with my parents, shit, I don’t even want to do that. My parents haven’t done shit for me except remind me why I’m a lazy sack of shit and I never get a day of rest from their constant criticisms and constant reminders of why I’m not the son they hoped for. They rarely ever give me compliments and they NEVER get my morale up whatsoever. I just sit here in this fucking dirty cluttered house in my dirty cluttered room all day and wait for them to give me another criticism that I’ll never improve on and never prove to them that I improved anyways. 

Holy fuck, I feel so stuck in everything. The few friends I consider friends won’t ever message me and are busy talking to their own group chats and friends who have no idea that they exist, no one in my school gives a single fuck about me, and I have literal anuses for parents. I don’t want to be fucking 16. I wish I could be 5 or in elementary school or maybe just back in 8th grade again and actually be (slightly) outgoing and have the most innocent carefree view of the world again. But I don’t decide that and I’m not gonna be able to decide what’s gonna happen to me in the near future. I genuinely think I only have a year and a half left of my life and then I’ll just jump off the balcony of the second floor of school and pray I’ll crack my skull open and die of BFT. Nothing is ever gonna go my fucking way and there’s nothing I can do to change it. All the good luck in this world is reserved for everyone else except me and there’s nothing I can do about it. 

There’s so many other things I could talk about that’s wrong with my life but I’m sure I’m already hitting a text limit and I’ve already burdened you with massive walls of text so I’m gonna call this a post here and watch it get buried other everyone else here because thats the way it always goes in my life.

It’s a legitimate company, but I’m still annoyed at myself. I sent them a message using their website thing, and I also emailed them, and I might try contacting them on social media too. 

Their FAQ says you can’t apply discount codes ones you’ve placed the order, but that you can cancel the order, then re-order it with the codes applied. But it looks like you actually have to use that message thing to get somebody from their company to cancel the order, rather than just doing it yourself. 

The FAQ says you have 24 hours to cancel the order, but today is a Saturday and their website says their support team doesn’t work weekends.

,depression,"Hey, not 100% if it's ok to post this here, it doesn't seem to be against the rules, thanks to the community for providing this space.

I've been majorly depressed my whole life. I've had friends and been liked before and have always held down high-demanding employment, part of me is functional but, I've always felt broken. I've never had more than one or two close friends at a time and less than 5 my whole life, and I've lost all of them. Never let them see me for real.

I left the military after 4 years when I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. I am not sure how accurate that diagnosis was, I fought it at the time. I was forcibly committed twice. I never hurt anyone, I never did anything ""crazy"", but I admit I was no longer meeting my military duties and so they put me there. The worst was being lied to about it. Right up until they were walking me away from checkin and down the hall... Every single person told me I'd be fine I'd be coming home... It wasn't so bad. Military were segregated from gen pop and had stricter regiments of course but it was better. I have nightmares of it sometimes but I also miss it in some ways.

Anyway. Got out of the military. Switched career fields. Worked in a datacenter overnight for a bit, now I'm actually a developer for one of the biggest companies in the space. I worked so hard to get here. But. It doesn't mean to me now what it meant to me when I started down the path. I hate it sort of. But not because of the work just because it's not making me happy.

My wife left me almost 2 years ago. She was with someone else within a week. Divorce was finalized about half a year later. I don't blame her for leaving me, but she's hurt me a lot during the process and since. She used me for money and her sexual/emotional needs for a while and really fucked up my life. I only let her back in because how lonely and desperate I was for a friend and she knew that and. It's just hard to cope with that. I feel alienated from people most of the time. She was always different. She was my family. But she still used me that way and lied to me and took money I didn't have.

I have our two dogs now. They're 100% the reason I'm not dead. I owe them a family. I tell them Ohana every night because thats what we used to say I know its stupid. I want to die so much I can't describe it. I have equipment and plans and have done some testing to see what works. But I can't bring myself to abandon those dogs. I love them.

I cut myself every single day. Large deep cuts, my entire body is covered in scars head to toe. I use a serrated knife that has become my favorite because I like how it hurts and I it feels like the extra force needed to cut gives me a little more control with it. I've cut too deep on accident before and had some bad injuries. I don't want that when I cut I just want to help with how I feel.

Lately I think I've become addicted to downers. Clonazepam, Xanax, alcohol. Anything to not feel.

I usually work at least an 80 hour week at my job. Not that I have to. I just don't know what else I'd do with myself. Nothing feels good or happy.

My birth parents both had severe mental illnesses, my dad killed himself before I was born and I was born with a lot of drugs in my system. Spent a few years a while back tracking down my Mom, she didn't respond, didn't try again. Adoptive family has been fine, don't understand. My older sister molested me when I was younger and we've never talked about it. Told my wife in a vague way but eventually she started thinking I lied about being abused because I refused to admit who had done it.

I don't know what story I'm trying to tell. I just can't keep this inside. I don't have friends or anyone to talk to. If you want to talk back to me you can. If you want to be depressed at me I understand you can say sad things. I can't support any sort of contact but if I see someone say something I'll try and say something back.

Spent a few years a while back tracking down my Mom, she didn&amp;#39;t respond, didn&amp;#39;t try again. Adoptive family has been fine, don&amp;#39;t understand. My older sister molested me when I was younger and we&amp;#39;ve never talked about it. Told my wife in a vague way but eventually she started thinking I lied about being abused because I refused to admit who had done it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what story I&amp;#39;m trying to tell. I just can&amp;#39;t keep this inside. I don&amp;#39;t have friends or anyone to talk to. If you want to talk back to me you can. If you want to be depressed at me I understand you can say sad things. I can&amp;#39;t support any sort of contact but if I see someone say something I&amp;#39;ll try and say something back.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that&amp;#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"so for the past 4 months I’ve been struggling with OCD. I had my first onset in July. Literally it came out of nowhere. I never dealt with OCD before in my life or really understood what it was until that point and right before that day my mental health was pretty great actually I was still anxious at times but I was nowhere near where I was years ago with my anxiety and so I thought my life was going smoothly for once. That is until OCD came to ruin my life. So I have the OCD that’s non stop intrusive thoughts- gross thoughts I don’t ever want to think about again pretty much 24/7. 

Lately it’s been okay actually way better than July. I’m eating, I’m doing some things I used to but as I am getting better I still feel somewhat depressed and I guess that’s why I’m here. I would say I feel 85% normal but I don’t have any motivation to do anything really. Even when my mood is good I just have 0 motivation to do anything remotely productive. I started slowly incorporating hobbies into my day but it’s nowhere near the level I was before OCD hit me. You see pre-OCD my life was nowhere near perfect in fact I’m 23, been unemployed since the beginning of the year, I can’t drive, and I live with my mom and my brother who is more mentally ill than me and my mom needs to take care of him 24/7. There’s a lot more to my living situation I’ll spare everyone the details it’s basically very chaotic.  But despite all this I was very capable of not only helping my mom where I could but I was mostly very positive and my mood was up most of the time. I was also studying for the GRE, I would work out, read, play my violin; I was so productive. But now even though I’m doing better with my OCD and have been going to therapy for the past 4 months I still don’t feel myself and I feel frustrated and depressed. It’s like I’m focusing on all the negatives in my life and all of a sudden I feel trapped. Not only trapped in my situation but in my own mind and body and I’m so tired of it I feel like honestly giving up.  I’ve noticed my mood goes all over the place when it’s PMS season like even more than pre OCD and also makes my OCD worse. So yeah it’s that time of the month right now too so that doesn’t help. To make matters worse I lash out at my family and that’s not me either I’m just so fed up with everything. I think I could handle it better before ocd -my living situation at home because I was somewhat mentally stable so it was like at least I still had myself despite everything bad around me but now I don’t feel my essence anymore. I know this sounds like black and white thinking but it’s so hard to be motivated that’s my problem. I guess I just need advice on what to do when this gets in the way of me living my life.

Weekends are like its Saturday 1 pm in noon. I am sitting in my chair looking at my computer and i feel like there is no meaning of doing anything. I am just counting every minute of weekend that somehow it passes. And then cycle repeat.   


Its going on like this for 3 months now i am not finding any purpose in life to continue doing this.  
Like i have worked my ass off to be where i am right now. So that i can feel this feeling of emptiness??????  


I know people have telling me find new hobbies, go out, read books etc. I know what to do to kill time.   
But the point in life is you dont have to find hobbies, you dont have to make plan and go out. It just happens. You dont have to do it to kill your loneliness. It should come naturally. I have lost interest from all the things.

,depression,"It’s now been 6 years I’ve been dealing with depression and around 2 or 3 since I’ve started posting on this sub. Having those years under my belt I’ve been able to learn what triggers my depression and why I do the things I do. I’ve also become smart enough to know what it is I need to do to be better and act like a normal person. 

It’s this knowledge that makes me feel like maybe talking to other people and getting it out just isn’t right for me. I constantly think about talking to someone only to have the conversation in my head first and pretty much be able to guess what they would say. I always know what this friend would say or what my parents would say or what a therapist would say. It shows how cookie cutter and shallow some people responses are. And even when I do talk, that’s it it’s just talk. No action, no magic cure of course not. 

So I feel like I just have to deal with depression on my own, since I’m the only one who knows me and I’m the only one who can change me. It feels shitty it really does. Because when you first start dealing with it people tell you sadness will pass but it doesn’t. You have to learn to live with depression. This is who you are and what you always will be. All I can do is go to the gym, hold a job, finish school, and pretend to be normal. I feel like those are my only options because that’s what’s been expected of me. And even then I can’t do that shit right. I’ve gained 20lbs, quit my job to “focus on school” (yeah right cause Zoom meetings and 4 page papers are sO hArD), and every time I open my mouth I just make an ass of myself to those around me. I like to think Depression turned me into this asocial pariah, but if I would to be objective I’ve probably always been like this. 

The negative thoughts never leave. They’re a part of me now and a part of how I will view the world forever. 

You can only talk to people so many times before you’ve heard it all. Why can’t these people show that kind of love when I don’t beg for it, why do I have to come out first and plead like a dog for someone to listen. This subreddit feels like the only place my thoughts have a right to be. It’s like they only care when called upon, to save face, to do what they think is right because that would be the appropriate response. It’s like everyone who isn’t depressed is a Sociopath with a mask on. It’s depressed people that are honest with emotions, that show them uncensored and unfiltered. 

And you know what it’s selfish of me to think that other people owe me some kind of love. They don’t, and no one should be obligated to love anybody. Nobody else gets their hand held through life and I’m no special case. 

This morning I tried getting a noose ready for only the second time in my life. Of course my dumbass decided to rent a bungalow and so I don’t exactly have many vaulted ceilings or tall garages to hang myself in. After that failure I just started a load of laundry, went upstairs and cried for a bit. 

My father wants me to get a CC permit but I think having the gun would be too tempting. And messy, that’s why I prefer a noose or something similar. 

Some people find comfort in understanding their depression, or knowing what they have to do. To me I feel cheated, like I was promised salvation at the end of this fight. But I think that was a lie I told myself, thinking that if I had enough faith in that idea of the depression having a solid end, that would make the struggle worth it. 

I don’t even know what normal people act like anymore. How do normal people think? What do you guys think, like I said you’re the only ones in this world who I think are honest with their emotions. I know my ideals sound maybe harsh and too nihilistic, but it’s how I feel. If I want to be honest with myself I need to say things that are harsh.

,depression,"I have been struggling with depression my whole life, I'm currently 26 yrs old, and before I was just sad after certain hours of the day. I remember that in fifth grade I felt so sad that anything would make me want to cry, and around five I would feel so sad that I would try to spend time with my family or I would try to distract myself by watching tv. Both of my parents have depression although neither of them has done anything about it. They just go through life, fighting because they still want to be there for me and my younger brothers.

Anyways, those automatic depressive thoughts - it&amp;#39;s not even about me thinking I did something wrong - I just get them so easily. I don&amp;#39;t know how to get rid of them. It just makes me so negative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also constantly get reminded by normal things (like when someone talks about anything) how worthless I am. I can&amp;#39;t help comparing myself with others - how ugly I am, how boring I am, how I haven&amp;#39;t accomplished anything in comparison to them, etc. I don&amp;#39;t know how to get rid of that. Working on improving myself will increase my self-esteem, but I can&amp;#39;t help feeling bad on how I currently am. I end up ruminating on past bad experiences on how bad I am. I don&amp;#39;t know how to get rid of that.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hello everyone,

I don't use Reddit that often but I feel like the people on this website are quite understanding and helpful. I've gotten myself into a mess during my first year of college. To provide a bit of context I've been struggling with Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Depression for the majority of my life. I took Lexapro and Zoloft for several years and after getting on those medications I slowly began feeling normal again. I wanted to stop the medication before my first year of college and so I did. During my last year of high school, I did great without the meds. I was happy and I was also excited to see what college brought about. I chose to go to the university in my hometown, a decision that I somewhat regret now. Anyways the first few weeks I was feeling great, I was participating in class, getting my work done. One morning I woke up and I felt unmotivated. This is a theme that constantly reoccurs in my life and it's one of the biggest things I hate about myself. The theme is that I always start something strong and I'm so motivated to do it. Then one day I wake up and every speck of motivation to do the task is gone. Anyways, I wake up this one morning and I feel unmotivated and tired. I proceed to email my professors that I did not feel good and since covid was going around I figured.. blah blah blah. So I do that and all my professors are super cool about it. I was planning on using this day to finish up all the work I had to do and I figured since I wasn't going to class I would be able to start working ahead. Inadvertently, I spend most of the day just laying around. I scold myself at the end of the day and try to force myself to do my schoolwork but it just isn't happening. I think ""oh well, I'll just do it tomorrow."" I ended up doing the same thing the next day and the next. Each day I woke up a sense of sadness and loneliness crept up inside me. And even though I beat myself up about it every waking second I STILL could not make myself do the work. So fast forward to the present time and it's now been over a month since I have gone to a single class in two of my courses. I skipped doing my work in all five classes for probably two weeks. Each day I wake up it takes all the strength I have just to get out of bed. I've never been one to talk or think about suicide and now suicidal thoughts are constantly in my head. I feel like a disappointment to my family and friends. I feel like such a loser. Also, I mentioned how I stayed in my hometown for college, well my academic advisor is my best friend's dad.

,depression,"Long story short- I need more vitamin D than just supplements but the foods recommended by my Dr aren't an option.

Complete story-

Last year, my vitamin levels were in the ""insufficient"" range. I did nothing about this, and I dropped down to single digit ""deficient"" numbers. After taking daily 2000IU vitamin D, I rose up to the same number I was at last year. I want to get in the ""sufficient"" range because depression is hard enough as it is without accounting for low vitamin D levels.
My doctor recommended fish, milk, eggs, mushrooms, and then vitamin D fortified foods (Orange juice and bread). Issue is, I'm vegan and I despise mushrooms with all my being. Even if I weren't vegan, I don't like fish or milk in any capacity. And I don't currently eat eggs. I could if it were necessary, but I'd prefer not to. I don't eat many foods that use bread as those are generally breakfast foods and I skip breakfast since I have to be at work at the ass crack of dawn. Now, the only option I'm left with is Vitamin D fortified orange juice, which most likely won't be enough. 

Does anybody know of anything else I can do? I try to get in the sun when I can but Florida isn't very conducive to being outside in the daytime and I work 7am-7pm so I don't really see the sun on days I work.

I didn’t realise that not only did I have a family illness that would make it difficult for me to get a medical, but I was also below the minimum height for a pilot. I also didn’t have any money to study, but somehow I believed I could save hard and pay for it.

So at this point in life I must come to terms with the fact that most airline pilots are qualified by 20 years old, and friends I grew up with the same age as me are now captains for airlines. I never made it.

I cannot believe I've let myself be duped by you for so long. I've seen this pattern happen a hundred times, and every time I let myself get scammed because I have the hope, the dream, that this time, just for once in my life, I will finally meet a good human being, who truly cares, not some stepford-smiling ice-hearted calculator who runs on money. Parasites like you prey on people like me. That's what all this is all about in the end isn't it? Money. 

Every single repair man, therapist, dentist, doctor, every profession that performs a service for money, every last one of them has to justify their own existence. If I take my car to the shop and they fix the problem, that's it said and done. That is not a business, they did not create a return customer from me. 'Repair people' are not just incentivized, but morally obligated by their profession to break things. Sure they fix the leaky oil, but at the same time they loosen a few other bolts. A few weeks later and bam, repeat customer, your existence is justified. You get to keep living for another week, paying the price with the blood of others.

You really had me going there for a long while, but your own two-faced nature betrayed you. You were only ever in it for the money, the only time I could ever get the time of day from you is when I was paying you to give a shit. The instant money was not changing hands, the instant you were not justifying your own parasitic existence, I was no longer worth the time of day. Empty platitudes, then one-word replies, ultimately no reply at all, you were just unlucky that you pushed it too far and I realized that you'd only give me the time of day if I was paying you. Seen this pattern a hundred times, fall for it a hundred times again.

If there is such a thing as justice and such a place as hell, I hope to see you there. When I pen my suicide note I will be sure to indict you fully for your culpability in my death. You are the apex predator, the wolf who stalks the herd, waiting for the weak and sickly to grow tired, seizing the chance to pounce. No, that gives you too much credit, that implies you hunt, you put in effort. You are the wolf in sheep's clothing who sits and waits in the herd for the vulnerable to come to you of their own accord. Why lift a finger when you can simply dress in smiles and white lies and watch as the sheep line up for the slaughter? 

I hope you lose sleep at night but I know heartless psychopaths like you can read this without batting an eye.

Recently, my girl friend and I broke up and what hurts even more is that it was because of my depression and it was taking a toll on our relationship. We broke up so that we could both focus on ourselves because we can’t be in a happy relationship when we aren’t happy with ourselves. It makes sense and it wasn’t a bad break up at all, we still talk and support each other, but it has gotten to the point where I feel like talking to her has just made it harder for me to get focused on myself and I feel like I am holding her back as well. I really really don’t want to stop talking to her and I want to stay friends but I feel like my depression is building up more and more the more I talk to her. What should I do?

Also on top of that, really none of my friends besides one haven’t even asked if I was okay or even check in on me after the break up. Like i was clearly sad and torn up but none of them (except the one like i mentioned) asked if i was okay. That just made me feel like I wasn’t even noticed and that I’m all alone.

,depression,"hello. first time posting here, and i'm here to vent and ask if what i'm experiencing is common, or part of another issue entirely. i'm 18m, with one or two less than fortunate things going on that tend to get to me now and again. i've been diagnosed by my therapist and psychiatrist (severe depression and episodic depression respectively, i don't know if those are proper terms as neither quite like diagnosing).

i just really hope this doesn't get ignored. i don't blame people, however. this place has a lot of members, and a lot of people with issues similar to mine. i need to keep reminding myself of that, that i'm not alone, but it's hard to do when you're the only one experiencing exactly what's in your head. i wish i could let someone else in instead of doing the talking. i should stop rambling and get to the point. not sure if content warnings are necessary, but just in case, i'm going to be talking about the following: **eating and mentioned eating disorders.** if you're not comfortable with any of these, please don't feel obligated to read on. i just hope the words themselves don't have negative effects on anyone here. if they do, please tell me and i'll remove the post.

onto the actual issue. i've had depression for years now. i started going to a therapist back in middle school after breaking down over a 'd' in math class. since then, therapy has helped me incredibly with my anxiety (also diagnosed), but it feels like my depression is just getting worse. i think everyone's struggling at least a little with quarantine. in my case though, my high school graduation was not quite cancelled, but heavily altered to fit with all of this. the last few months of high school, i didn't see much of my friends, didn't do a single assignment, made off with Fs in all classes for the quarter but still graduated thanks to past work. summer came and went, and i was making plans to go to a local community college to take some basic classes before moving onto med school. plans were made, an appointment with the college counselor was scheduled, and i missed the appointment. i'd worked really hard up until that point, but when that happened, i stopped entirely. it simply wasn't worth it anymore. now it's october, and i've no plans to start classes in the spring semester. i keep telling myself i've got time, knowing full well that i'm not going to act on it alone. my parents are doing their best to help me, bless them both. my therapist and psychiatrist have also both recommended an iop, which i'm half-working on. i have a few numbers to call, things to set up, but again, it's not worth it. that's surely my depression speaking, but it just speaks so loud. i'm tired, and i'd rather do other things. not the things that i ought to get done, just... other things. i'm tired, and i'm bored.

the reason my psychiatrist recommended an iop was because my depression has essentially skyrocketed, but i've not told him about some other things going on, namely one thing. i'm simply not taking care of myself. this is the core of the post, really, a line that's been echoing in my head for the past twenty minutes: *even when i'm hungry, i'm not hungry.* it's not that i think of myself as fat, it's not that i think i don't deserve food (that's came and went), i'm very aware that i've been underweight all my life and i'm self-conscious about my lankiness. plus, i still eat. when my mom makes food, or my brother comes to visit and brings food, or my dad makes something, most of the time i'll eat plenty of what they made (i usually eat around one large-ish meal a day). but when i'm alone, i just don't. i don't see a point, because i don't feel hungry. well, i do feel hungry, but i don't feel like eating. i hate it when it gets all complicated, it's like i'm just spouting fluff at this point.

if i truly didn't care about eating, or about my health, i wouldn't be posting here. i'm posting here not only because i do care, but because i'm hungry. i'm hungry, but i'm still not hungry.

i don't know what i'm looking for out of posting here, i've just written an essay about my depression and decided to hit post without proofreading. i'm sorry if i've wasted anyone's time, i just want to know if this is something more serious than what i'm already dealing with. or maybe some motivation to eat. i don't want to worry my friends about this, but i keep 'slipping up.' quotes are there because half the time i'm doing it on purpose. maybe i want someone to know that i'm really, truly not all right. but none of my friends are all right either, and it's not like we can properly help each other.

i'm stopping myself from typing more. sorry for rambling, and thank you for reading this far. i'll sign this since my username is weird (and don't worry about that, genuinely).

&lt;p&gt;i just really hope this doesn&amp;#39;t get ignored. i don&amp;#39;t blame people, however. this place has a lot of members, and a lot of people with issues similar to mine. i need to keep reminding myself of that, that i&amp;#39;m not alone, but it&amp;#39;s hard to do when you&amp;#39;re the only one experiencing exactly what&amp;#39;s in your head. i wish i could let someone else in instead of doing the talking. i should stop rambling and get to the point. not sure if content warnings are necessary, but just in case, i&amp;#39;m going to be talking about the following: &lt;strong&gt;eating and mentioned eating disorders.&lt;/strong&gt; if you&amp;#39;re not comfortable with any of these, please don&amp;#39;t feel obligated to read on. i just hope the words themselves don&amp;#39;t have negative effects on anyone here. if they do, please tell me and i&amp;#39;ll remove the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;onto the actual issue. i&amp;#39;ve had depression for years now. i started going to a therapist back in middle school after breaking down over a &amp;#39;d&amp;#39; in math class. since then, therapy has helped me incredibly with my anxiety (also diagnosed), but it feels like my depression is just getting worse. i think everyone&amp;#39;s struggling at least a little with quarantine. in my case though, my high school graduation was not quite cancelled, but heavily altered to fit with all of this. the last few months of high school, i didn&amp;#39;t see much of my friends, didn&amp;#39;t do a single assignment, made off with Fs in all classes for the quarter but still graduated thanks to past work. summer came and went, and i was making plans to go to a local community college to take some basic classes before moving onto med school. plans were made, an appointment with the college counselor was scheduled, and i missed the appointment. i&amp;#39;d worked really hard up until that point, but when that happened, i stopped entirely. it simply wasn&amp;#39;t worth it anymore. now it&amp;#39;s october, and i&amp;#39;ve no plans to start classes in the spring semester. i keep telling myself i&amp;#39;ve got time, knowing full well that i&amp;#39;m not going to act on it alone. my parents are doing their best to help me, bless them both. my therapist and psychiatrist have also both recommended an iop, which i&amp;#39;m half-working on. i have a few numbers to call, things to set up, but again, it&amp;#39;s not worth it. that&amp;#39;s surely my depression speaking, but it just speaks so loud. i&amp;#39;m tired, and i&amp;#39;d rather do other things. not the things that i ought to get done, just... other things. i&amp;#39;m tired, and i&amp;#39;m bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the reason my psychiatrist recommended an iop was because my depression has essentially skyrocketed, but i&amp;#39;ve not told him about some other things going on, namely one thing. i&amp;#39;m simply not taking care of myself. this is the core of the post, really, a line that&amp;#39;s been echoing in my head for the past twenty minutes: &lt;em&gt;even when i&amp;#39;m hungry, i&amp;#39;m not hungry.&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#39;s not that i think of myself as fat, it&amp;#39;s not that i think i don&amp;#39;t deserve food (that&amp;#39;s came and went), i&amp;#39;m very aware that i&amp;#39;ve been underweight all my life and i&amp;#39;m self-conscious about my lankiness. plus, i still eat. when my mom makes food, or my brother comes to visit and brings food, or my dad makes something, most of the time i&amp;#39;ll eat plenty of what they made (i usually eat around one large-ish meal a day). but when i&amp;#39;m alone, i just don&amp;#39;t. i don&amp;#39;t see a point, because i don&amp;#39;t feel hungry. well, i do feel hungry, but i don&amp;#39;t feel like eating. i hate it when it gets all complicated, it&amp;#39;s like i&amp;#39;m just spouting fluff at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if i truly didn&amp;#39;t care about eating, or about my health, i wouldn&amp;#39;t be posting here. i&amp;#39;m posting here not only because i do care, but because i&amp;#39;m hungry. i&amp;#39;m hungry, but i&amp;#39;m still not hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i don&amp;#39;t know what i&amp;#39;m looking for out of posting here, i&amp;#39;ve just written an essay about my depression and decided to hit post without proofreading. i&amp;#39;m sorry if i&amp;#39;ve wasted anyone&amp;#39;s time, i just want to know if this is something more serious than what i&amp;#39;m already dealing with. or maybe some motivation to eat. i don&amp;#39;t want to worry my friends about this, but i keep &amp;#39;slipping up.&amp;#39; quotes are there because half the time i&amp;#39;m doing it on purpose. maybe i want someone to know that i&amp;#39;m really, truly not all right. but none of my friends are all right either, and it&amp;#39;s not like we can properly help each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m stopping myself from typing more. sorry for rambling, and thank you for reading this far. i&amp;#39;ll sign this since my username is weird (and don&amp;#39;t worry about that, genuinely).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-j&lt;/p&gt;

No grief so I’m not depressed&lt;/p&gt;

What makes things even worse is me being extremely picky, disgusted by any meat/fish plus onions/garlic, eggs and more. I don&amp;#39;t even know how to eat healthy when I am so limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you cook? How do you find the energy to do it? Does eating healthy make you feel better? Any tips?&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"When I think about nonexistence, I feel at ease. I'm not overstimulated or dissociating regularly. I don't have to deal with the constant stream of troubling thoughts. I don't have to deal with my every train of thought violently crashing and burning into a plume of neural static.

I don't even have to think at all.

I've discussed this with loved ones, only to be met with the same response - ""But you won't feel happiness, either!"" I know. I'm perfectly aware of this.  But it's gotten to be a bit much, I tell you, having to feel all of these feelings. I like being happy when I'm able to be, but nowadays, it's only when I'm distracting myself from the world around me with assorted sweet nothings.

You see, if life is like a box of chocolates, it's gotten to the point where I've eaten too much. That sickly sweet aftertaste we all know and love has manifested. I feel like I'm going to vomit, but I can't.  As I keep eating them, the variety there once was is greatly reduced. Each chocolate is one of those crappy little dollar store chocolates that kind of taste like plastic. Every once in a while, I might come across something unique, but the aftertaste continues to linger because it's still chocolate. The worst things in the box are the occasional cigarette butts and hidden thumbtacks stabbing me in the tongue.

Now, as much as I want to throw the box away, I can't. I have people who love me, and I love them. If I throw the box away, I'll die because the chocolates keep me alive for whatever plot-related reason. If I die, I'll make a lot of people really sad and that would  suck. On the other hand, though, I won't have any intrusive thoughts to plague me if I don't exist. It's a troubling dilemma for sure.

For now, I can only hope that things get better for not only me, but for everyone else who's suffering. I guess only time will tell.

But i notice that when others are situationally depressed, im apathetic about it. I see solutions to their depression and if they dont want to do something about it, then i dont want to gear it and i just turn emotionally cold.

,depression,"Hey Reddit,

I met this beautiful girl over a dating app. We've been talking every day for almost three months now, and we started dating. Everything is going great, I'm really into this girl. She makes me laugh a lot, she's smart, she's super cute, and she's kind. We have a lot of similarities, and we're the same ethnicity, which only made us connect more because of our similar culture. Basically, the ideal girl for me. We go on a few dates, everything is awesome. We joke about our future together. I'm not in love yet, but I could be. I'm invested in this girl. I couldn't be happier, and she feels just as happy as I am.

Or so I thought

I knew she had problems at home; her disconnection with her parents was evident. To sum it up, her father is manipulative, abusive, (not physically), etc. And I guess her mother favors her sisters over her and disregards her feelings entirely. So she doesn't feel loved by her parents or simply isn't. But she has everything; she's a teeny bit spoiled and she knows it. But as she's said, she just wants love from her parents and their validation. I guess that's a horrible way to feel for your entire life. I would probably feel the same.

&amp;#x200B;

So, fast forward to last Friday. We go on a date, everything is awesome, and I feel in love. The following day, she told me she had an appointment with her therapist. I didn't judge, that's fine. It's extra support if you need it. But for the next few days, she barely spoke to me. She just told me we needed to talk, but continued to delay it. She wasn't texting a lot and was really brief and lacking emotion. This wasn't like her at all. She was such an energetic and happy person. So I'm over here thinking, ""what the fuck, she wants to break up?? why?? and why is she delaying it?"". It was on Wednesday that we finally spoke.

She told me her therapist had diagnosed her with dysthymia, or persistent depressive disorder, and I believe she was also deemed suicidal. Her therapist also recommended her self-admit, stating that her case isn't severe enough for him to admit her. This came as a shock to me. She had told me before that she had attempted suicide, etc, and I did think it was a yellow flag, but I didn't think it was this bad. But then again, everyone always thinks that.

We've been talking since, but everything is different. I feel like I'm talking to a completely different person, not the person I once knew. Regardless, I'm offering my support, I want to be at her side. I know she doesn't have anyone else to help. She tells me how she feels, how she thinks about suicide often, how she's numb, how she doesn't want to live. I mean, fuck. That's pretty disheartening to hear, especially from someone you thought felt the complete opposite. I offer my support, and I'm really trying to help; I'll text her often, treating her normally, but I get unenergetic responses. I can almost feel what she's going through. 

Now, she's asking me to leave her. She doesn't want me to ""see her unravel"", nor does she want to bring me down with her or impact me negatively. Imagine how you would feel if someone said this shit to you. It's horrible. But I don't want to leave her; I am here for her. 

I'm afraid to leave her. I feel that if I do leave, she'll have no one else, and she just might do it. She keeps telling me she doesn't want to die yet, and that I shouldn't worry about her. But that in it of itself is pretty fucking worrisome, no? 

So what are my options? Stay with her, possibly bring me down with her (slightly inevitable, my thoughts have already revolved around her since she told me her feelings). Or, I leave her. But I don't want to leave her. I mean, what's the point of a relationship if I can't stay and help even in the hard times? I thought about contacting her sister via social media, and just establishing a connection with the sister so that if anything starts heading in the wrong direction, I have a family member I can contact, but I don't know if I would be in the wrong to do that. 

I really like this girl. I know I'd be devastated if she killed herself. 

She keeps telling me that I need to forget about her and move on.

What I'm thinking, is that I still have enough leeway to try and convince her to hang out with me one last time. I could talk to her then, try and see how she's doing. But ultimately, I think the goal will be to get her to self-admit, no? I might be able to do that if I can convince her that I'll leave her if she can self-admit. 

If I leave her, she'll have nobody else, and she probably won't have a reason to live.

&amp;#x200B;

After getting myself through high school somehow after missing months of school every year due to physical and mental health problems I’m still fucking here in the same rut I’ve been in my whole life.  I decided not to go to college and now I’m just working a shitty part time job around 20-30 hours a week, now I don’t even want to do that anymore. My old psychiatrist left the state back in March so I haven’t had any therapy or mental health guidance since then and I’m struggling so much I don’t know what to do. I have an appointment scheduled with a new doctor in two weeks but I have no idea how I’m going to make it that long. I have a shift in 4 hours and I’m laying in bed knowing that the very last thing I want to do is go make stupid frappucinos for kids at the mall. I don’t know how to push myself to go in even though I don’t have a real reason other than the same crippling depression I should know how to deal with by now&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"This girl had gone through an incredibly abusive relationship in the past, she can't relate to people and basically just dates online because she knows nothing of nothing.  As an added bonus, she cuts herself with a box cutter. That girl was my world I stood by during her freaking insecure tantrums, her self doubts, I encouraged her dreams constantly. I told her to put herself first before anything and that I would always be there when she was ready. 

Well she crossed the line and began an argument with me where I kept talling her to stop that she was hurting me and did'nt care and just kept going off on me. I walked away. Sure enough the next morning I get a long letter of her apologizing, wanting a family, she admitted her anger gets the best of her. I love this girl and said to take it slow and easy.  6 hours later I get an email with her saying she's retired from dating because its too much for her. This plunged me into a nightmare of pill popping just to cope with my decision, which was she has every right to do what she wants as long as it makes her happy.

My mother passes a few days later and since I don't trust a lot of people I contacted her because I needed support. She started another argument and begged me to stop crying so hard because it was making her feel it was her fault and that she needed to cut herself. I can't believe I allowed my depression to get the best of me and since I had nowhere to go I turned to reddit. SHE FOLLOWED ME INTO THE THREAD in which the girl was anonymous and then emailed me that it was slander, a witch hunt and harassment. She said to never contact her again. Because I am not stupid I have all the conversations we have recorded were one can see she was straight up abusive of me. She went on this insane rampage of needed piece, to stop talking about her on reddit. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with that girl and I've beaten myself up everyday thinking that I simply wasn't enough for her. So here I am having flashbacks and trying to get my shit together again.

Her insults were brutal it felt like she was taking aim at all the people who hurt her in the past. I don't know what the fuck.

,depression,"I recently lost someone very close and important to me. I'm having a difficult time with it. She and i did everything together and now i have to continue without her.

Everytime I'm alone i break down and this situation has caused me a lot of emotional pain and I'm not sure how to handle it.

I mainly have been playing PC and i always had people around me, but this weekend I'm home alone and my friends aren't going to be there either. 

I have a difficult time being alone since i lost her and i don't want to be alone this weekend. I don't trust myself. 

In short all i want is someone who i can talk with in a voice call or even just text. Maybe plays some games with. I play titanfall 2,overwatch, Gta v, red dead redemption, sea of thieves, pubg and a few other too. We don't even have to play i just want to have someone to be with. 

A few things about me so you have some idea who you're talking to. 
I'm 17M and my social life has mostly been online. Thats because when i was younger i got shot and i was severely bullied for my scars and because of that i became really introverted. So when i started playing online thats when i had some sort of friends to play with. Most of the people i played with are in their 30's but now they're gone too after 5 years. 

I don't care about age or gender, i just want someone or a friend i can talk to because i feel lost and in a way scared. 

I've been having some trouble with depression and anxiety for a while now, so it's difficult for me to meet new people or even become friends with them. I'm alone in this and i can't really turn to anyone

,depression,"Just about any time someone is unhappy, the diagnosis comes back ""You have low self-esteem. You need to learn that you have value. You need to learn to love yourself."" And in a lot of cases that's applicable advice. Maybe even most cases. 

But take me, for instance. I'm unhappy because I'm 47 years old and never got to make proper use of my youth. And it's not that I don't want help, I do want help. But if I go somewhere and rant about how I'm still a virgin at the age of 47, what I'll be told is ""You need help. Help with your self-esteem."" And I'll say ""I don't think I do. I think myself is pretty cool. I just don't like my life."" And people will tell me ""You're obviously being too hard on yourself for the life choices you made. If you had healthy self-esteem, you'd understand that your life choices weren't a mistake. Your life choices have value. Learn to love the sexless, friendless, mediocre you that you've become.""

So i don’t truly know how to start writing this!

I am currently laying down on the bed on a Friday and it’s lockdown.

I keep thinking about my life and I can’t focus and am easily distracted by almost anything, i would be thinking about my next thing to do today and someone passes by and am all distracted by what are they thinking about me and what if behaved in this way and that way.

Honestly I can’t know for sure what is this called but lately I’ve experiencing a weird state of child like thoughts and I can’t think of one thing I’d love to do for the rest of my life, it’s like if i hear someone talking about climbing I’d think what if i choose the path to be a hiker and a climber and etc and then in the same group if there was a musician I’d start thinking about how i love music too and should try to do it and start rapping. 

Am like having this conflict of ideas and thoughts and I can’t seem to understand what I truly want or desire, i have worked 4 jobs by now Chef, steward, booking and reservations and lastly a tourism representative at the airport meet and greet.

I did love the lifestyle of being free and not being committed to one thing for the rest of my life, like traveling and meeting new people and hiking and exploring just to realize lately this weird thing about myself “ i can’t stay with same group of people for so long it makes me bored and revels i like to call it a dark side” i love having friends but it’s complicated like you always find me around and suddenly I don’t feel like hanging out anymore not because the person did something wrong but because i crave something new! I can’t seem to love myself like i used to before I judge and criticize myself all the time about things if people heard me saying they’d think am literally stupid example “ am fat or am ugly or they are looking at me this way because i said something wrong or i look a certain way.

I am somewhat sensitive on the side when i hear comments from people around me, i don’t show it i just feel it and overthink it for a couple of days maybe rarely weeks!

,depression,"Hi, I am... well, dealing with a lot right now.

I worked in Marketing for a very large company for 1,5 years almost. Everything was fine (not amazing) until Corona came. Because of my mental health, the whole pandemic thing was stressing me out as well (as probably all of us) and then I had a talk with my boss - who told me, that I made too many mistakes and wasn't working as efficiently as I should have - mind you, I was sent into home office (which barely worked, because my company was very slow and inefficient on the IT-side, I had to enter my PC at work via Remote Desktop, which barely functioned and slowed down my process extremely.) Also, I was put into 'short-time work"" - so basically, I got 80% of my salary, which was paid by the state and was working 50% of my usual time -  I still had the same amount of work.

The mistakes I made were just really minor ones, ones that I usually fixed right away, that had never cost the company any money, so just the small things everyone did wrong once in a while. Other mistakes were directly linked to our poor IT-support and the problems with our dysfunctional home office system (they blamed me for not answering mails, because me mail program was not working for a whole day). All in all his criticism seemed incredibly nitpicky.

So my boss critizied me and I took his criticism by heart and changed the things he complained about. It went like this for 2 months, when he suddenly asked me to come to his office (so I travelled to my work place, because I still was in homeoffice) and he was there with a member of the board and told me, that they needed to work more efficiently in marketing, and so they needed to get rid of people - and as I am the one who has been in the company the shortest, it should be me. Of course, I was really sad, but also angry, because it was simply not justified in my opinion. 

Anyway, what really disappointed me the most, was the way they handled the whole situation. My boss didn't even have the balls to tell me this on his own, he had a board member to do it for him. Then, none of my colleagues, after they heard of this, called or wrote to me. Like they didn't care at all - I just worked with them for 1,5 years and they just pretend now, like I didn't exist. When I left the meeting, all I got from my boss, was a half-hearted ""Sorry"" - as if he had just stepped on my toe - even though he had taken away my job - which is really crappy in this economy.

When I called me boss a few days ago, because of a formality of the whole firing-process, he answered the phone and asked who it was - meaning that he already has deleted my number out of his phone.  
I often asked myself, if I was the problem, if I was a horrible person - but this simply can't be -first, because in every other job I had, I was pretty popular, but when I had tried to bond with my coworkers and to get to know them, they would just answer with one word and ignore me. So I kept to myself, and noticed that none of them were really talking to each other.

Anyway, I feel like they handle it now, as if I have never been there. I recieved a mail with my contract from my boss, and in his email signature, I could see that he had been promoted - whatever this means...

Con: for every successfully planned and executed activist action there were so many false starts. So much wasted time, and I’m really not down with that, it really wore on my patience. In general, im not as forgiving as i used to be about that, and i was never forgiving about it so lol.

Pro: connecting with people with the same interests. Met a lot of cool people IRL via events. Kind of wish I kept in contact with them when I fell off the face of the earth.

Con: so many fake people acting crazy on social media. Like literally people acting nuts, keyboard courage. The amount of childish arguments I’ve seen 😒 made me lose respect for a lot of people I may have otherwise liked.

Pro: artistic community. So much inspiration, people collaborating and doing amazing things. I’m a musician and it would be amazing to one day find a band.

Con: stalkers, people sizing you up, acting like they know you because they seen some pictures. Leads to drama IRL, for example potential employers, co-worker drama, ect.

Pro: speaking of bands, all the little sweepstakes and fun little things the bands do on their social media. Sigh, what I wouldn’t do to catch one of those secret shows.

Con: I could slip into an addictive relationship with it. It could affect my self-esteem. I know they’ve done studies and there’s a link between social media use and depression. I felt very depressed scrolling through social media in the past. I don’t know if I need that distraction, I’ve made a lot of progress these last two years without social media.

You kiss your best friend, miss your bus home and end up walking an hour in the freeing 2am autumn air. 

And that walk. That walk is pure fucking freedom. You're shivering so you jog to warm up and as you run you just feel ALIVE. As your ears go numb and your breaths run short you feel so REAL. There's emotions running through your mind, there's thoughts one after another. You think about people you love, and for once, you know that you are loved. You smell the air and feel the cold wind tickle your outstretched fingertips. You hear your heart beat hard in your chest, so strong and solid and real.

You feel reinvigorated. You feel like life is actually happening around you, even if the world is empty and silent now. After weeks and weeks of floating; of existing but not truly being there. You feel present. 

The next day you feel great. Not perfect, but so much better than before. You think maybe this is the start of an upward climb. Maybe you will start to come out of this deep depression you were in. With a gained sense of self love and knowing you matter to someone, maybe you can claw your way back up.

The weight of all of your problems is back on your shoulders and you feel heavy and tired. You skip school, email that you're sick, even though you know you can't afford to miss more. You're already failing miserably and this is college, you paid to be there and yet, you're skipping again.

You spend the day in bed sleeping; trying to pretend you don't exist. Your head is devoid of any creative thought or inspiration. You have no motivation to do anything. 

When you finally do get out of bed and try to socialize with your roommates, you feel distant. You chuckle and smile now and then, but it fades fast and the joy never hits your chest. It's surface level. It's all surface level. 

And you realize it's back again. The depression. It never left. It didn't fade enough. You can't claw yourself out of the pit.

After not drinking soda for about ten years, I'm back to drinking it, ordering pizza and have to struggle just to cook anything rather than order from Grubhub or go to McDonald's. 


I used to take pictures of my gym progress nearly everyday and, now, I haven't taken a picture of myself for at least five months. I feel ugly, disappointed and alone. The only sense of happiness I've found in all this stress is my cat, who has constantly been next to me no matter where I am in my apartment. She's the reason I try not to entertain anything drastic, because I've woken up wanting to give up.


I feel like nothing will go back to normal and I changed my life too late. I feel like I'm back where I was years ago and I'm too depressed, anxious and angry to give it another try. I busted my ass for years just to have it all taken away from me. I'm eating a burrito from a local Mexican joint while I type this and, even though it's good, I don't feel good. With Winter around the corner, it'll only get worse.



I feel guilty with every cinnamon roll or potato chip that I eat and that makes eating them so much worse and I just want to eat more and forget about it. I want to run far away enough from the successful, great person I used to be before all this so I don't have to face them. I just want to eat and stay away from everyone.



No conventions, no concerts, no meetups with friends and potentially no holidays.

A year later, she contacted my parents asking for the ultrasound of the dead fetus, then when that was gone, she threatened to my dad saying I raped her, I showed my dad that I wasn&amp;#39;t using screenshots of her asking to be fucked long afterwards, then she asked my dad about universities. My parents said that she&amp;#39;s hurt. She&amp;#39;s just being manipulative and likes to play the victim in my eyes. Her family said that they just want her to move on and that she should have nothing to do with me anymore.I know I am not a rapist, I have proof of consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want her out of my life right now. Forever, gone. My dad refuses to block her since he calmed her down in to not doing the report. I&amp;#39;m like father, please, I am losing my mind here. And he&amp;#39;s like, what about her?

,depression,"I’m new to Reddit, and decided to join this group tonight after I got off work because I just don’t know who to talk to. I only see my psychiatrist every two months and I don’t see him until the 11th of November. I don’t talk to my family about it because I don’t want them to see weakness and I want them to know that my life is on track. My co-workers just don’t care and I don’t blame them. I’m a 27 year old male. I was diagnosed initially with schizophrenia at HCPC back in 2016, but after another two month stay at the same hospital I didn’t meet the criteria for it anymore and was diagnosed by a team of psychiatrists and psychologists with major depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms/features in 2018. I was put on invega, cilexa, and gabapentin. About a month an a half ago I decided I wanted to get off of meds and tried to wean myself off, and started binge drinking to cope with the withdraw symptoms. I developed psychosis from all that stuff and don’t remember almost a week before leading up to the hospital. I stay with my Dad right now to save money. I told him I wanted to shoot myself in the heart with my powerful crossbow so he called 911 and two paramedics took me to Cypress hospital where I was in suicide watch. It was the worst 5 days of my life. I don’t really want to talk about that stay.

Anyways, when I got out I suffered extreme insomnia. I was told by my doctor there that it wasn’t from the alcohol because it already left my system. I stayed up for 24 hours every other day. My appetite was insane and I ate everything in sight. I think this was because I stopped eating when I stopped my meds and my body was craving nutrients. Anyways I started feeling better up to about 2 weeks ago. My Doc put me on trazadone and my sleep got better. Now i’m up until 5 am and sleep until 2 as I don’t work until 5. My appetite is back to one meal a day. 

I just feel stuck. And lonely. I have a supportive family but I feel distant from them. All I do is work, sleep, eat, and play on my phone. My days off are ruined because I wake up so late. My dog Oliver is there to great me in the afternoon when I wake up and he kind of helps me. I just feel like i’m a burden to everyone and people are talking about me. I feel like i’m just a robot or a machine pushing through everyday life. I know thousands of you feel the same way but i’m scared that this time it will get much worse. I’m sober now, and after almost dying the first night at the hospital i’ve been scared straight from using drinking to cope. I was treated horribly in the hospital by some of the staff.

,depression,"I've suffered from severe depression since 2012. I had previously been able to work (scanning heart rhythms in a private cardiology clinic) but my depression has become so severe I can't cope with day to day work and have had several hospital admissions for suicidal thoughts.

I have been on 7 different antidepressants (all starting low dose the going up through doses to maximum)- No alleviation of symptoms at all. I've completed a 6 week course on CBT, DBT and Mindfulness- No help at all.

I my last few consults with my psychiatrist I have pushed for an ECT referral as I meet all criteria, only to be fobbed off.

,depression,"I don't know if I should be posting something like this here, but I just wanted to share what I think was quite strange.

To give a bit of backstory: I am not depressed nor sad. I have a cheery and sanguine personality. I have hobbies which I am pretty enthusiastic about. I am in University, majoring in math, and am doing well. I have no financial problems whatsoever because I earned quite a bit of scholarship. My family is normal. Upper middle class, caring and loving and christmases and birthday parties and all that; I have no childhood traumas or anything either. I don't have any worries currently and I have a lot to look forward to in my life. My dream is to someday research a topic in math, and I don't think that dream is unachievable. I work hard to study every day not because of feelings of obligation, but because it interests me. I don't work too hard that I'd tire myself out either.

However, despite being so abjectly normal, I am constantly wanting to die. There is no sadness or anything pertaining to my urge; it's like constantly being hungry and thinking ""I want to eat a sandwich."" I am not ""tired of it all"" as some people put it. 

Maybe some people will say that I don't really want to die, and that I am being overdramatic or facetious. That may be so, but I have tried jumping off high cliffs and tried stabbing my neck with a knife several times. At the last moment, I kinda get stiff and almost pass out, unable to actually kill myself. I don't want to cut my wrist and leave scars when I fail killing myself. I want a surefire way to die (I have not tried to hang myself because we dont have a beam high enough at my house).

If somebody told me that I have things to look forward to and a reason to live, I'd agree with them. But I feel like that is in no way correlated to me living or dying. To make an analogy, when I was little, I didn't want to go to sleep when my cousins came over to play because I was having so much fun. Now, however, I don't mind going to sleep when they come over. Not necessarily because I am tired or it isn't fun playing with them, but for some reason I dont mind going to sleep. I will also have fun the next day, and going to sleep doesn't really change that. That's exactly how I feel about dying. Except I have an urge to die, unlike going to sleep.

The fact that I want to die doesn't make me sad or anything; the notion of wanting to die as if I were some kind of mentally weak depressed person kind of amuses me sometimes. The only thing that stops me from killing myself is the fear of the process of dying. Reasons like ""your family will be sad if you die"" doesn't deter me from wanting to die because I think it really doesn't matter what your family feels - or anybody, for that matter - feels or thinks after I am dead.

Yeah I thought it was quite weird. My writing may be all over the place because Its time for me to sleep and I didn't have time to organize what I wanted to convey. But basically I don't think dying is a big deal; no more serious than eating a sandwitch. That might be why I'm constantly wanting to die.
