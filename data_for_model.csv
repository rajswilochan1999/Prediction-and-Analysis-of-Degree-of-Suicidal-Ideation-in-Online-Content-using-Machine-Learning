"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",SQLwitch,175,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,understand people reply immediately op invitation talk privately mean help type

Are most people sad?,"I’ve been scrolling through this subreddit all night now, and I’m beginning to realize there is an infinite amount of people just going through the worst shit ever. I started looking through this subreddit because I am beginning to notice that I am pretty depressed too. It’s beginning to become obvious to me that I will have to work really hard to get out of the depression-hole that I’ve dug myself into. But I can also see that there are a lot of people who are a lot and I mean A LOT worse then my case has ever been. Are most people sad? Are most people like me where they can’t stop thinking about every single fucking thing and if I even begin to have a fun moment all I can think is “this is a fun moment. Hold on to this cuz the moment you lose it you’ll be sad again” and because I think that way I lose my fun moment instantly and just sit and think about how awful life is. There’s people who are even worse then me though, and it just gets sadder and sadder. When I think this way I get even more sad and I come to a point where all I can tell myself is everyone is sad, everything  is pointless, and I don’t know what to do anymore

I don't have motivation for anything anymore, and hope is lost for me.

My best friends bachelor/bachelorette party made me suicidal,"I hate typing this out because typing it hurts but it is what it is.

They’re my best friends and had a joint party for the both of them because thats how they roll. It was held in their friends house because their apartment is too small. The apartment was extended nice and I just kind of got jealous. That was the start.

Eventually the party led into games about the bride and groom, and then led into a toast. The toast about the bride and groom just really dug into me. I’ll never have friends who care this much about me. I don’t feel close to anyone anymore. I feel like an imposter friend, someone who doesn’t deserve to be here. I kind of get this thought because the bride specifically said that they didn’t have enough space in the wedding party so I was the one who got cut. I guess it hurt more than I thought.

And to clarify, I am using techniques that are supposed to help. Telling myself things like I’m incredibly lucky to be here, I’m glad to have friends. I see this house as a goal for my future. 

But all I keep seeing are things I won’t have. I don’t forsee myself getting married, and if I do, who would come anyway? Who would want to be part anything concerned with me?

I don’t feel like I’m close to anyone anymore. I keep everyone at an arms distance because all my life I feel like thats what they’ve done with me or what they’re going to do with me. I’m constantly reminded that I don’t have a best friend or anyone I can truly confide in. I have a boyfriend and yet, I just feel so alone.

How would you deal with loneliness if you had no friends at all?,"I've lost all my friends. I can't deprecate myself, really, the only thing I'm good at is being a friend, but I feel like people always took advantage of my friendship until they didn't need it anymore.

An entire year of no productivity and little social interaction will have passed by soon. That is a depressing thought.,"And whilst all this time has gone by, a realisation has slowly washed over me of all of the time that was wasted from 2016 to 2019. It fills me with this unfathomable regret. There’s so much more I could have done, that I should* have done. But what was I more interested in doing? Sitting idly by weeping a stream of crybaby crocodile tears and sleeping throughout the majority of most mornings or afternoons.

If I’d any sense I would have gotten my act together and enrolled for a course. Or taken up a temp job. Fucking anything would have been better than laying around with a thumb up my ass.

There’s a lot that I took for granted without really thinking. I miss being able to go outdoors whenever wherever without needing a valid reason why. Yes that rule has been somewhat lifted in scotland now but I don’t even like wearing a facemask simply because I hate making eye contact with other people when they can’t see my mouth, I try to smile but they can’t see it so it always look like i’m scowling at them and I know it. 

I miss being able to be with and within a close proximity of friends, yes phone calls/social media apps/group chats/xbox live party chats are great and all but goddamn do I miss seeing their faces. I want to hug them, share food with them, take some stupid pictures of us all and just be in the same room with them feeling their presence.

Just knowing that covid can and has killed, and that it’s causing many a problem for millions of people is so horrible. I wish I could help in some way but what the hell can I do? I’m just a 20 year old with no money, no car, no experience of any kind. I’m no doctor or charity. I’m of no use right now and that hurts to know. (Oh boohoo you have it sooo bad don’t you drew)

Okay here comes the obligatory speech from me, i’m sorry if this post screams ‘attention seeking little asshole is having stupid first world problems’ or if it just generally sucks.

Nobody tells you about the anger...,"Yeah, depression makes you sad. For a while. You'll eventually remember those as the Good Times. When you may have felt like shit, but you still *felt shit.*  
And then comes a phase that's comparatively pleasant at first. The sadness stops. Everything stops. Your emotional range is reduced to three-day-old stubble, chain smoking and walking away from explosions. You're practically an action hero. And it's kind of cool for a while.  
Sure, you burn all your bridges, you become increasingly isolated, but *the pain is gone.* Along with everything else, but still.  


Conversely, the recovery process has some pretty unpleasant parts. Your atrophied emotions return slowly, one by one. Which one comes back first is a bit of a gamble.  


For me, it is blind rage at a world that let this happen. That *keeps* letting this happen *to all of us.*  
What do I do with this seething hatred of all that there is? I know I won't let it loose on the world. Down that road lies madness. I shall do no harm. But how do you cope?  


Yes, I need therapy. No, I can't afford it. I've lost 30%+ of my body weight in four years, partly due to lack of appetite/lack of any drive to maintain the machine that perpetuates my consciousness, but mostly due to sheer fucking poverty. As many of you may have noticed, depressed people tend to become less and less employable as their mental state deteriorates... And you still need to eat. So yeah, that particular solution will have to wait for a bit.  


I'm not on the streets. Not yet. A friend gives me shelter and tries to feed me, despite having issues of her own.  
But I can't even leave this ""home away from home"", because the *palpable* ignorance of otherwise (presumably) innocent people makes me feel like a ticking bomb. The only reason I even know how to hold that back is that I was raised by someone who could not. It... stays with you, for lack of a better word.  


I'm... perhaps a bit more knowledgeable than the average about the nitty-gritty details of dopaminergic depression as a long-term effect of untreated ADHD, so I have a decent idea about the *mechanics* of my problem, but much like a profound understanding of the chemical composition of a hollow-point bullet does precious little to quell the pain of a gut shot, I am at my wit's end about how to make it bearable. Not just for me, but for my environment.  


If there's anyone out there who has first-hand experience in holding back the molten hatred coursing through their veins, *please* help me. I do not want to become bitter *beyond* the unavoidable extent of my mental illness.  
I do not want to hate.

Considering suicide,"Prepare for a major rant,

I'm an individual who has suffered from depression since my early 20s. I'm now 25 and over the past few years it has gradually got worse. I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder. 

I'm taking medication and I'm on a waiting list to receive treatment for my personality issues. I keep telling myself it's gonna get better, things will improve and I've gotta keep going. But I honestly don't know how long I can keep fighting, it's exhausting. I often have suicidal ideation and it's become so extreme I've been searching on suicidal methods.

I don't want to die, I mean I don't think I do. I just want all this to stop. I want all this pain to end. I feel like I'm just existing in this world. You could ask me what have I got to be depressed about because from the outside people would say I've got a normal life. I've got a job, I've got a car, I've got people who care about me and I'm pretty well travelled so I should be happy, right? But for me it's not enough and that makes me feel selfish. 

I think when I realise in that moment nothing is gonna change, there's no hope and it gets too much I'm gonna do something drastic. I want to go peacefully and I've been thinking about taking a whole bunch of pills mixed with alcohol and hoping for the best.

"""Your depression is getting worse"" and other fun/obvious statements with some responses after.","Sorry, I woke up about 3 hours ago with this on my mind and I can't seem to let it go. 

I've had depression for a long time but only been formally diagnosed with it and GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder) for about 3 years. Don't get me wrong, it has been useful in the past to have an outside perspective, especially when I'm too depressed to notice my depression. However, I really wish people would use some critical thinking when trying to tell me the obvious or give me some unsolicited advice.

""Your depression is getting worse"" oh? I just thought having a sudden need to sleep for 16 hours a day and drinking several cups of coffee outside of that just to feel normal was something everyone went through.

""Did you know your diet can affect your mood?"". Yes. I get that, however, please understand I'm part of a heavily covid hit sector and as a result even paying rent has been hard. I really don't have the money to spend on whatever fancy quinoa mix you're trying to give me right now. Sometimes bread, potato and some apples a family member picked from their garden tree as a gift is the only thing I can eat this week. 

""Well! *offended noises* I'm just trying to help! Arn't I allowed to do that at least?"" Oh hey mom, nice to see you still can't handle someone not following your every word like gospel. I get that you are trying to do some good but you've refused to listen to me the last ten times we've had this conversation. Also, please stop using this line, it's a classic guilt trip and makes me genuinely want to have not so kind words with you.

""Maybe medication will help?"" I have had some success, but the side effects have all impacted my anxiety so bad that either a doctor has either taken me off them or in one case I took myself off them. (I cannot stress how bad an idea going cold turkey is holy shit DO NOT do that). Right now, me and my doctor have decided to take a break and have moved me to just Cognative Behavioural Therapy for now. 

""You are just lazy"" or ""You are not depressed, I have depression and it's nothing like what I go through."" Oh look, its mom again. I see the ""woe is me"" card is still a favourite of yours. Look, depression is not the same in everyone, it's a mixed bag of cognative, behavioural and physical symptoms. Just because your model of depression is insomnia inducing, it doesn't mean my constant fatigue is me being lazy. 

""Oh my god, I'm so depressed."" Maybe you are. But quick reminder depression is not just another word for sadness. Please stop using it for sympathy points either in real life or on the Internet because depression fucking destroys lives. I can still feel sympathy towards you if you're having a bad day. I feel less sympathy when you act like it's a fashion accessory to show off.

""Depression isn't real/ a liberal hoax"" Yeah, I guess the Anxiety attack I had in the doctors office the first time I tried to explain to my doctor some of my experiences was a totally normal reaction. Or maybe the fact that I once spent 4 months in bed, only leaving my flat to buy food at night was extremley normal behaviour too? If denial is your poison of choice, whatever. Just let me get the medical help I need so I don't turn into another statistic you'll say is fake.

Sorry for the rant, I know no one asked but sometimes ranting into the void helps get my mind clear for a while. I hope it gets better for those reading this.

It really sucks to be ugly,"My teeth are highlighter yellow. They always have been, even though I’ve been trying to whiten them for years. I think it’s genetic, because my dad’s were the same. Ive had horrible under eye bags since I was a kid. I have a double chin when I smile. I’m deathly pale. 

I spent a bunch of money on makeup and teeth whiteners online, and I put it all on to prove to myself that I could look okay if I tried. But I just look like a fucking clown. If this is as good as I can look in the prime of my life, what the fuck is the point. No one will take me seriously in my career if I look like a sick Victorian child. People don’t want to befriend the shitty looking person. It’s hard enough to make friends as an adult already, and my shit personality doesn’t help either. 

In the past I’ve avoided mirrors for months so I wouldn’t see how horrible I look. I brushed my teeth with the lights off. I’ve literally had entire days ruined because I accidentally saw myself in the mirror. Kids have asked why my teeth are yellow. A guy in high school said he would kill himself if he looked like me. 

I’ve looked into plastic surgery and veneers, but it’s so much money. I have no aesthetic vision and I can’t even envision what I would look like with different hair or facial features, so I’m not even sure how to fix it.

The worst bit? Regret.,"No one talks about this as much as they should. The sheer regret you feel after the decisions your depressed mind makes.


I just spent the day outdoors with my family - shopping, roaming around and eating dinner at the beach. 


I was dissociating the entire time.


The voice wouldn’t shut up: “God, I can’t wait until this shit is over”; “I’m finally going to do it tonight”; “I wish they’d just shut up and let me eat in peace”.



Guess what the voice was saying the second I got home?

"If I killed myself, no one would miss me.","And I know everyone says that, but listen. 

I don’t have any friends. Two years ago I moved across the country to start a new life because everyone I knew back home grew to hate me. None of my family talks to me or has any idea about what I’m doing besides my mom, and she’s the only person I’ve got. The only catch with her is that I’ve grown to realize that our relationship is her only using me for her own personal gain with occasional gifts and affection to blindside me. 

I’m ironing over a lot because for the longest I use to think killing myself would do everyone else the favor because I was just an inconvenience. But recently I’ve come to realize that that’s an only small fraction of it, I’m not only an inconvenience, but that absolutely no one cares about me...at all. And I can’t think of a person in my past that ever has genuinely, and if they did I didn’t know...and I’d still be doing them the favor. 

Not to mention how much of a societies waste that I am no matter how hard that I try to pull myself out of all of the thought situations that I’m in....I just keep (somehow) crawling deeper into them. I’m sorry if I sound selfish wanting to kill myself because no one cares about me but after all of th terrible shit over been through I mean...can I just have one person that’s not going to use me and actually care about me?

Aripiprazole has to be the best drug ever made,"Outside of cocaine obviously.

But in all honesty I have NEVER been in as much balance as after I started using this drug. This truly is a magic pill. All of my social interactions are normal. I do not judge all of my coworkers for being lame and unoriginal in every second thought. I listen to them and actually find them to be nice people. I never consider suicide anymore. Life has not been this good for me since I was in grade school I believe. I'm currently taking 5mg per day but I'm going to up the dose to 10 mg.

I read some other place that people find wellbutrin even increases the positive effects of this drug. I'm currently using 200mg sertral per day, 5mg abilify and 10mg risolid before I go to bed. I'm just so happy all the time. This is an insane transformation in a matter of a few days. If you guys are looking for something to try out I'd ask my doctor if he can give this a shot. This truly is a miracle drug.

Is anything worth it at this point.,"Lately I’ve been feeling distant and zoned out. Sometimes my parents are talking to me and I have no recollection of the words they are saying until I snap back into reality. I sit through hours upon hours of online lectures just staring at the screen not retaining a word that is being thought and looking at the clock saying 7 hours have gone by. I feel like I am disconnecting from my mind, simple tasks and assignments take me hours to do and no matter how hard I study I retain nothing. Added to that I hate my body so much, I’ve removed every single mirrored object from my room so that I do not have to look at myself. All I see is a big slob with cankles, a big nose and short frizzy hair. Yes I fake the “happiness” everyday for the sake of my parents as my home life is pretty okay. However, I despise waking up everyday, reliving the same routine everyday and seeing the same people everyday. I’ve cut off so many friendships I’ve lost count so I literally have 5 or so at the moment. Recently I’ve tried other coping mechanisms such as “trying to sex my sadness away” but that doesn’t even help and if anything it just makes it worse. I have an exam tomorrow and I just cannot be bothered, my mother says I’m lazy but I just don’t see the point of studying as it will make no difference. At this point I’m contemplating just dropping out of uni all together and not going back. I just cannot stand logging on everyday and seeing all their faces so happy and so enthusiastic, it just kills me inside. Yes I have gone to a therapist, yes I have tried medications, no nothing have changed after almost 2 years. Man I only see one way out at this point and it seems as if that’s the best option. The only thing stopping me is my parents as they lost my older sister to a fatal brain infection some years ago.

Attempted to overdose myself. It was a hellish experience,"This happened about two weeks ago.

I only got hospitalised for two days. In those two days everyone just got mad at me.

“There are people who have it worse than you”
“You’re just looking for attention, aren’t you”
“Really? In the middle of a fucking pandemic?”
“You know that’s a terrible sin against God”
“What the hell is wrong with you?”

From the people in the hospital to my aunts and uncles and to my mother they just got mad at me. I have never felt so alone and helpless in my life. Even worse, when my mom told my dad that I just overdosed before bringing me to the hospital, he literally didn’t care and just went to sleep. When I got discharged he just continued to treat me like shit.

It was midnight when I took the pills. I pussied out as always and only took like a small amount. I didn’t feel anything after I took them, so I just went to sleep. The next day my head felt like it was gonna explode. It was the most painful headache I’ve experienced in my life, and my body was really hot. My mom kept nagging me to eat breakfast so I finally told her that I attempted to overdose myself. On the trip from home to the hospital, my mom, aunt and uncle (who were there to drive me to the hospital) just berated me on the entire trip. I was crying the whole time. 

There were so many people that talked to me at the hospital. All of them just said the same shitty things. I wanted to cry so bad but my eyes were dried out of tears. Then they said shit like “Just meditate and everything would be okay” “Just pray to God”. After the entire thing, it was as if nothing happened.

I just feel so terrible and helpless. Thinking about it now, maybe they are right. I really am just an ungrateful idiot. 

Right now everything has gone back to normal. Still doing my schoolwork. Nobody really knows what happened to me, only my parents, aunts and uncles. 

Now I really regret it. Maybe I shouldn’t have done that. Maybe I should have taken more. I really just feel so alone. My classmates don’t know and they think I just got a bit sick because of my brief disappearance. It really puts into perspective that I’m nothing more than a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things.

I don’t really know where I’m going with this. So sorry it’s incomprehensible and stupidly long. I just need to finally tell someone about my experience. That’s all

Trapped in a life I don't want to live,"my name is will, I am 18yrs old from Australia, i am currently extremely depressed and have been battling suicidal thoughts for well over 2years. I have severe acne and I feel hopeless. From about half way through high school my acne worsened, i had a friend group and I still do but I never fully considered them friends. Its hard to explain but people don't look at you the same, you feel the same as everyone else but I could tell I didn't fit in. No matter who i was with i would always feel alone, i would also struggle with conversation as I would always be in my head. I wouldn't finish or want to finish what I was saying because I would feel as if people didn't want to hear me talk. I hated school towards the end, I didn't attend graduation, formal, or any school events. After school finished \[about a year ago now\] i got into drugs, not hard drugs just marijuana, lsd, and occasionally dmt. I just needed an escape i guess. besides the point i feel as if the drugs helped, I don't live near town and just live with my father who is old now. I never have someone to talk to, so when my father would go to sleep i would just get high and talk to myself. recently i started going to gym again and have had some crazy progress, i have an excellent understanding of nutrition and bodybuilding, its my passion, i am well above average build and people would compliment me on photos but it would make no difference. Acne is just a deal breaker, nobody will ever get close enough to me or ever see past the skin, its just how humans are. Also to everyone that will give advice like go talk to friends and do things that make you happy, that's the thing, acne just doesn't work that way. All I want to do is hide, all my mind can think about is how i need to stay home, hide, and fix myself before I can go out and socialise and be normal again. But i have no clue how long that will be, its not getting better and I don't know when it will. \[I am on a non dairy diet and using proper acne medication btw\] Anyway point being I feel as if all I'm doing is wasting time hiding trying to fix myself, but now I'm even more depressed because I'm wasting my life. every time I go out or try to socialise I just remind myself of how I need to be fixed. 2 of my good friends have committed suicide and I know for a fact I'm next, I just cant do it right now, I couldn't do that to my dad, it would destroy him, a father should never have to burry his son. My life currently is just a mess and I wish I could end it all with no repercussions, I currently have 2 options. wait until my life is fixed and there is a turnaround, or wait until my father passes away so he wont have to deal with my death. It sounds depressing and dark I know, but it is what it is, some people are just different I guess. I don't feel sad about ending my life, and I am not depressed about the fact that I will be gone soon enough, I'm just depressed because I'm trapped in a life I don't want to live, but I cant escape without hurting the ones I love most.

Do you actually feel like you’re in pain?,"I suppose I’m pretty severely depressed — I literally can’t get any joy out of my life, everything feels like a chore, the only things I do end up doing are out of obligation and I physically and mentally exhaust myself doing them (being able to do them when I feel obligated is the only thing I’ve got going for me). I feel so empty, and like disconnected from everyone and the world. There’s no meaning in anything at all. I’m not in a terrible circumstance, but I’m so incredibly unhappy. I spend every waking second wanting to disappear from everyone I know for a day, and end that day by killing myself for good. There’s no fear, at least now right now. I’d probably feel scared right before doing, but I know I’d be able to push through and do it anyway because that’s just how hopeless and empty I feel.

I’ve read that so many people who suffer from depression feel like they’re in pain. I don’t know why I don’t feel that way. I’m not in pain per se — I know physical pain, and emotional pain from very hurtful things where i sob till my fingers go numb, but this feels different. I’m not in pain, but being alive feels painful and endless. I don’t feel the hurt but I feel like I’ve lost my patience, and every new day is akin to a prison sentence.

How to help my friend with depression?,"Hello! 
My bestfriend told me that she has been diagnosed to severe depression. I didn't have any idea of that, so im still a little shook.. she told me this in Friday. 
Yesterday i invited her to my house, and we just chilled, played card games,,, and we went to a lil piknik! She thanked me for making food for her, and told me that she hasnt eaten that much. On the evening i reminded her to eat, and reminded that she is very very important to me, and others too.
 What should i do? I wanna help her as much as i can, but still dont wanna be too pushy (can i bee too pushy with this?) . Im thinking that i would reminder her everyday about eating, but is it too pushy or is it just a nice thing to do?

Rant,"I have no idea what started this profound sadness in my life but ever since I was around 10 I’ve been so fucking sad. Every day I would wake and just wish for it all to end. I’m 16 now. A year ago or 2 I started dabbling with drugs and alcohol. Pretty much since I started drinking, I’ve gotten myself blackout drunk every night, or I’d smoke if I had weed. Even take MDMA for a treat. It’s all that makes me feel that life is somewhat tolerable. I chase every high that I can get, and disregard anything for the future. I don’t have any regard for my own life. When I’m walking  to school or somewhere else I’ll intentionally cross the road to where I’m about to be hit by passing cars. Several nights I’ve grabbed my dads prescriptions and just downed a shit ton on impulse. Only to wake up the next morning with nothing changed. I’m just numb. I don’t feel joy from anything in life. I’ll have these episodes for months on end where I lack the motivation to do absolutely anything. The last few years of school I’ve stopped trying and my grades have dropped like crazy. I don’t know what to do. Occasionally I’ll have these sudden bursts of motivation and joy, and it’ll feel amazing. I start doing something new and a week later it all just turns into another damn chore. One time I actually tried opening up to one of my close friends about how I felt. He basically disregarded everything I had said and essentially said other people had things worse. I’m just kinda done with everything right now.

Yay life I guess...(Description of my personal hell),"So, for the past couple months I’ve been slowly pruning my social media... I’m only on Reddit now, obviously, and Facebook for a political activism group I am debating leaving since I’m barely active in there anyway. (Probably due to my depression and abstaining from mainstream politics as I feel like the odd man out hating this election like last election...)

I digress, the point of this post is a detailed description of my pain and sorrow. An unfettered look into my psyche with as much articulative knowledge from the English language as I can muster up. I want to be fully forward... I never have been and no one ever listened...even if no one cares.

For the longest time, I’ve gone through multiple layers of hell. Each one more arduous than the last so much so I feel as though I’ll break eventually but they all center one or two aspects of the human condition:

Love/Loneliness and sociality

My hell is also self-perpetuated but fueled off of every negative event I’ve gone through. Seeking negativity was a sickness because I was extremely accustomed to it. It was the only way anyone acknowledged me as a child, a teenager, and now a man if you can even call me one...

Growing up, I was surrounded by very devout and aggressive southern baptists. Violence was always the answer and I was the odd man out as a pacifist. My mother was never really there. She’d work two jobs...sometimes three, to make ends meet while being married to my step-father.

I never knew my father besides one time where I spent a night at his motel with his new wife and daughters...awkwardly. And another when my grandfather called him to invite him down while my parents were visiting him. They fought like hell and I watched them fight while my mom talked to her cousin like nothing happened.

I was taught to respect my step-father because he was “there” and “paid his way”...when he was only there to beat me sometimes amor find the littlest imperfection I exuded. Oh, and he still works at the same job while my mom became a doctor.

I never really told my mom until recently and just as the time when I was a six year old I knew she’d blame it on me and my “jealousy” trying to ruin her marriage. She justified his abuse saying he grew up with a terrible drunk father.

I guess, subconsciously, I acted out and pissed him off because at least when he calmed down he said he loved me more.

School was usually the same way. I acted out and talked because then people would actually notice my existence. I was an “attention whore”... even when bullies hated me it felt good to not be ignored.

Then middle school came and high school where I let boys who didn’t know if they were gay touch and molest me if they wanted...it bothered me to be used by those who thought my existence was an abomination but I felt good in a sick way being used.

Then undergraduate college came: long story short I was ostracized from a “friend” group that I was active in and helpful in. Accused of sexual harassment, given death threats, shunned my fellow classmates, manipulated by multiple men I dated, raped and used by someone I trusted, and blocked out of everyone’s lives on social media.

Everywhere I went. I was despised and hated. No matter how hard I tried to be a positive person, to care and love for people, I was used like a cumrag and thrown away. I exude darkness.

So, I snapped. I became a hardcore nihilist and tried to kill myself multiple times to which my mother retorted “I bet you were praying to Jesus then, huh?”

As loving as she can be she can be very vindictive and precise with her words...so much so it feels like the person you love stabbed you with a knife in your throat wondering if it was all worth it to struggle against the precipice of death.

One thing is for certain...only adrenaline and cortisol kept me alive. That was all.

Today, I’m alive. I’m not okay but I’m alive and I guess that’s something.

Despite this hell on earth I want to do great things for humanity and I hope to achieve it. I will at least try.

I’ve talked to many therapists and tried many psychotropic medications for several years to no avail and to little to no success.

I hate I know the blueprint of what to do to but the architecture of my brain has grown a cage around that awareness and clairvoyance like the developmental neuroplasticity of my brain from the BEGINNING is hard wired for misery. 

It’s akin to knowing and being aware of all that is wrong and you wish you could make people see but you can’t and they never will see.

So, I’ll probably just go back to the gay dating apps...and mindlessly peruse them thinking I have any chance. Then delete them when I can’t take it anymore. Then redownload them and look for approval and worth with sex. Ad infinitum ad mortem...

Not sure if I’ll ever get better or improve sufficiently enough for myself. How could I when I’m so broken from others and myself? Is my individuality an error?

Why am I everything abominable to everyone: a gay, black, fat, weird, ugly, disgusting person...

Why is it so hard? Why can’t I just be loved for fucking once? Why is it bad to be needy? Why is it bad to want to be loved? I would give my all to someone and more.

I am a being of love who never has it requited and never will. I feel meant for it and I starve and die slowly without it. It is a basic need just like a bird needs to fly but even they get caged...and when you are caged, psyche and all, you stop trying to fly...and maybe the wings are useless and maybe they should be pruned...",TheStockyScholar,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhoy6p/yay_life_i_guessdescription_of_my_personal_hell/,past couple month slowly pruning social medium reddit obviously

Wow another vent how quirky,"I hate the way I look. 

I can’t lose weight. All I want to do is lose weight. But what do I go and do when I feel like shit? I eat because  why not feel like shit for eating on top of feeling like shit for being fat! I want to just starve myself but I can’t even do that.
   My acne has really really flared up which is really helping with my self esteem. I quit my job of 2 weeks because I couldn’t handle the stress and anxiety of it. I’ve done it before and now my family’s disappointed in me for not being able to commit to anything. 
   I’m behind in school because some days the thought of actually getting up and doing it makes me sick. 
    I joked with my mom “hey maybe I should get a therapist because all my friends have one.” I know it’s never going to fucking happen! Even if it did there know way my parents will ever get me on any type of meds. 
   Maybe I’m not even fucked up and I’m just making myself think I am! How do I even know I’m real? I don’t fucking feel real. I can’t remember anything from my childhood. I can’t remember a month ago or even yesterday. It fucking sucks. I can’t even cry I’m just empty. How edgy and quirky am I? I fucking hate it.

IDK if this fits into the definition of depression but here goes," I've posted this to r/DecidingToBeBetter but was wondering if this belongs here too?

I have been putting off making this post since a long time. I've never been this vulnerable my whole life and am ashamed to ask for help to friends and family. Finally decided to lay it down in front of total strangers on the internet.

It seems like I have nothing to complain about. I have a steady job with decent income and cheap housing affords me a decent savings. I'm also fortunate enough to be able to work from home during this pandemic. I am extremely fortunate to have that in my life and am very grateful.

I've observed that I've been spiraling down for the last 4-5 months. Since the beginning of work from home directive, my consumption of junk across all social media, especially YouTube and Reddit, has increased steeply. I've been slacking off in all aspects of my life. I've stopped taking care of my hygiene, taking showers as infrequently as once a week or less. I haven't cleaned my room for over 2 months. I've constantly been eating loads of junk food and skipping all the meals. I don't remember when I last did any physical activity. It's been ages since I read a book or anything that'd help me grow. I've lost all my motivation to work. If things get even a tiny bit tough, which they often do, I fall back to scrolling nonsense on my phone. I am constantly missing deadlines. On top of that I've developed a crippling addiction to smoking cigarettes (more than a pack a day). It feels like there is no way to climb back up from this pit. Feels like I keep falling and falling with nothing to grab on to.",sattyrox1000,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhtx2r/idk_if_this_fits_into_the_definition_of/,posted r decidingtobebetter wa wondering belongs putting making post since long time never vulnerable whole life ashamed ask help friend family finally decided lay front total stranger internet seems like nothing complain steady job decent income cheap housing affords decent saving also fortunate enough able work home pandemic extremely fortunate life grateful observed spiraling last 4 5 month since beginning work home directive consumption junk across social medium especially youtube reddit ha increased steeply slacking aspect life stopped taking care hygiene taking shower infrequently week le cleaned room 2 month constantly eating load junk food skipping meal remember last physical activity age since read book anything help grow lost motivation work thing get even tiny bit tough often fall back scrolling nonsense phone constantly missing deadline top developed crippling addiction smoking cigarette pack day feel like way climb back pit feel like keep falling falling nothing grab,idk fit definition depression go,atty rox 1000,1620,64,atty rox 1000 posted r decidingtobebetter wa wondering belongs putting making post since long time never vulnerable whole life ashamed ask help friend family finally decided lay front total stranger internet seems like nothing complain steady job decent income cheap housing affords decent saving also fortunate enough able work home pandemic extremely fortunate life grateful observed spiraling last 4 5 month since beginning work home directive consumption junk across social medium especially youtube reddit ha increased steeply slacking aspect life stopped taking care hygiene taking shower infrequently week le cleaned room 2 month constantly eating load junk food skipping meal remember last physical activity age since read book anything help grow lost motivation work thing get even tiny bit tough often fall back scrolling nonsense phone constantly missing deadline top developed crippling addiction smoking cigarette pack day feel like way climb back pit feel like keep falling falling nothing grab idk fit definition depression go
"I’ve completely stopped caring about getting better, I have no emotions left to feel like something is wrong","Logically, I can tell something is wrong. I just dont really care about fixing it. I’m just really confused. In the past, when I felt empty and I couldnt feel anything, it was horrible, I knew it was from my depression, and there was an underlying sadness or despair to it. 

Now I just dont feel anything in general. I completely do not care. I have no hope for my future, no plans or anything. I dont feel sorry for myself or want to cry at my shit life. I have barely any money and Im not doing anything to have an income. I just go hungry and starve until I get lucky and a family member buys me food. I dont have any desire to continue my hobbies, or school, nor do I feel any remorse for completely abandoning them. I feel lost and confused about whats going on, but I dont feel strong enough about it to want to change. Im only writing this post because in the past, I would have seeked help if I was in this situation. 

Is this what its like for depression to win? To just let yourself fade with no resistance or conviction. I don’t really have reason to think my life is awful or my depression is ruining it. I know that its all my decision. All my failure is my fault and I guess im okay with that. But I guess theres some tiny bit of hope that something is wrong.

I want to quit my job without notice and go to a mental health facility,"So I’m a 22 year old female and I have recently been diagnosed with ADHD which was misdiagnosed as just anxiety and depression for a long time. I deal with both of those things, but the cause of them is my ADHD. Along with this, I am also dealing with PTSD. 

Backstory:
I’ve been at my job as a teacher’s assistant while I’m in college for a year and a half. Last week, my supervisor pulled me into a meeting to discuss how my attendance has been a problem. It was a 3 to 1 dynamic where I was being told by 3 people who do not work directly with me, that everything I’m doing is wrong with no warning. I have used 5 sick days since school started, which I’ll admit were really because my mental health has been so bad. I also ended up getting COVID and using part of my additional covid days we have been allowed this year. I haven’t used all my allotted sick days or even close to half of them. I’ve also always found a substitute. I also got in trouble for missing a training session that happened while I had COVID and they asked me to miss my graduate school classes to reschedule and I said no. Then they ended up scheduling it when I have therapy next week even after I asked them not to. I basically was told in this meeting that everything I’m doing is wrong. What it boils down to is them not communicating expectations to me, expecting me to do things outside of my job description and comfort zone (and humiliating me when I expressed discomfort), and also reprimanding me for doing work on a computer that the teacher I work directly with asked me to do.. which they didn’t know because they didn’t bother to ask either of us and had assumed I was just wasting time on social media while at work. There’s more to the story, and a lot more examples of my supervisors acting unprofessionally in this meeting and times before, but I’ll leave it at that. 

I’ve already been struggling very hard to keep my head above water. I’ve had ongoing suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, and depressive episodes where I can’t shower, eat, or take care of myself this whole year. The thought of going back to that place on Monday is  keeping me up at night and inciting more nightmares than I already have from the PTSD. I’m also in graduate school, and because of the stress and anxiety my job gives me, my grades have been suffering. 

I need to leave. I also need help. 

My therapist is amazing and I love her and I’ve made a lot of progress. But shit keeps hitting the fan and I think I need some more aggressive treatment and also a “break” where I can focus on me and learn better coping skills. I think I want to voluntarily check into a mental health facility. There is a really good program near where I live. My parents have agreed to help me financially.

My problem: 
I don’t know how to quit. I don’t know what to tell my teacher, my principle, or my student. I am so scared. But I can’t work there anymore. Taking a leave of absence isn’t an option for support staff. I don’t know what to say. I don’t even want to go in there again. Half of me just wants to send an email and never go back, but I left some stuff there and I do want to say bye to my student and the teacher I work with.

I’m worried because they won’t have a substitute to take my place Monday. But when I tell you I can’t work another day there, I’m serious that I can’t. On Thursday, one of my loved ones passed away and I was so scared to ask to leave that I just kept going to the bathroom and crying until I worked up the guts to ask off Friday. And one of my supervisors still made me feel bad for it because of the “circumstances” of my absences already.

I would like to add that this job is not necessary to my career growth. It’s not part of my path, the pay is not that good, and it may come in the way of my graduate school practicum next year anyway. So I was going to have to leave within the next year.. I just can’t make it that long. 

TL;DR: I suffer from ADHD and PTSD and I’m suicidal and depressed. My job has made things worse and treated me unfairly, and I need to quit so I can try to go to a mental health facility and focus on myself and school after that, but I don’t know how to

I am my problem,"I’m a fucking asshole. I treat the people i love like shit. I can’t seem to be happy around my friends. I can’t focus on my major, or anything school-related, for that matter. I can’t pay rent and medical bills. I can’t be there for the people that depend on me. I don’t have time to do things that i enjoy while the people around me get to do whatever they want. The list goes on, and each thing added to that list is just another source of depression for me. The source of all of these problems? It’s me. I’m tired of trying to be a person that i’m not, and at the same time the person that i am is an unlovable bitch that treats the world like garbage knowing full well that she’ll regret everything she chooses to do.

Lonely,"I've been living with good mental health for a while now - probably around a year, actually. Every now and then (probably about three times total in the past year) I've had these odd days where I just feel very isolated and lonely.

This isn't a 'Rona thing. This is just a me thing.

I have one IRL friend who couldn't give a shit about me. Never replies to texts despite being permanently fixed to her phone. Never makes plans. Never talks about anything outside of her deathly uninteresting life and ""drama"" of people I've never met, who she talks about as if I should know them.

I have one other friend - a good friend - who does text and call. Sadly she moved to America a few years back and we see one another for about one evening a year at this point, so in a way she doesn't count in this rant. She is good, though. We talk often.

I have one family member (nobody left, everyone died, quite an ""old"" family). My sister. She doesn't give a shit either. In several years the only time I speak to her, or see her, is when I impose myself on her. I get no invites, no texts, no calls to check in. 

On one level, I'm over it. I'm patiently waiting for these lockdowns to be over so life can be normal and I can try to make new friends. But on another level, it's crushing. I'm so lonely today. I just want to spend time with someone.

There's even the risk I have to spend Christmas completely alone (Cos lockdowns - Christmas is normally me at my sister's with her husband and kids, and then his parents but right now that might outright kill his folks so it's not worth the risk).

How depression destroys my financial intelligence...,"I received a gift of 350€ by my parents. I bought an Oculus Quest 2. Then realized my IPD was woo high so I couldn't use it. I tried to return it and they refused. My frustration and anxiety levels went up and, even if I was conscious of Wallapop and other reselling options, I took the self-destructive path because I asked for help to a friend, for his presence and he refused: I gifted the Quest to a random stranger.

Now I have 37€ left and a horrible feeling of regret, especially considering my feet hurt because shoes are too narrow and I can't buy new ones. This is what depresion and loneliness do. I can watch the positive side of it: ""I did something good for somebody else"", ""I learned sharing experiences is better than buying shit you don't need"", ""this way you will say fuck you to your overprotective parents"", ""you will build tolerance to stress""... But at the end, I always come back to that need of fucking kill myself.

Short-term depression/suicidal ideation??,"29F - have suffered with anxiety and depressive episodes since about 10 years old. Recently diagnosed with ADHD.

I can go from feeling ""ok"" and reasonably stable one day (just the usual underlying anxiety) and find myself feeling full of despair the next. I will start wishing I were dead and become unable to function, but the next day I'll have snapped out of it to some degree. Sometimes I have suicidal thoughts in passing, even when I'm not having a full blown depressive episode. 

I'm just wondering how common this is, as I understand depression is normally a long term experience and mine generally seems to be short term but very intense. I've had spirals that have lasted a week to a few months, but never much longer (although there may have been a year or two where I was just consistently miserable).

"Depression is back. Partner doesn't understand and feels like my depression is ""controlling his life.""","I reached my breaking point last night. I've been having a long bout of depression that's been slowly getting worse over time.

Moved to another country. I don't speak the language here, I have yet to meet any close friends in the 2 years I've been here. I haven't been able to work, since I had a small baby and they don't allow your child to go to daycare here until they're over a year old. So, I was on ""maternity"" time. I had been planning all these things I wanted to do when my child was old enough to go to daycare. And I was really looking forward to it...

And then Covid happened. We were worried about sending our child to daycare, but did anyway. She didn't get covid, but sick with a couple other illnesses, that she brought back every couple of weeks... So, we decided just to isolate from our older family members...

And then I found out I was pregnant again. Which came with a flood of emotions, and knowing: 1) no one is going to hire me if I have to go on maternity leave in less than a year, and 2) That means, I'm going to have to wait another 2 years... I tried to really stay on the bright side. I thought, maybe it's a good thing, since I only want two kids? Then I'll be able to work without any interruptions. I'm also not a spring chicken, I'm already in my 30s, so maybe it's better not to wait? Because setting up a career takes time and I wouldn't want to have another kid during that time. I may end up too old.

But of course being pregnant in the first trimester has had its challenges. Not only have I been dealing with my bout of depression, making me tired, I also have pregnancy exhaustion. I'm tired all the time. I have trouble sleeping. Last week was hell. I got food poisoning, was worried it would harm the baby, everything ended up being fine. But right after it was gone, I developed a migraine for 3 days. I couldn't take my migraine meds, because I'm pregnant. Tylenol didn't help. Ice didn't help. Caffeine sorta helped. But it sucked.

Now it's the weekend. Last night I couldn't sleep. I was actually up late listening to upbeat dance music. Went to lay down for sleep, I didn't want to have sex. Then my partner says, ""I can't let your depression control my life."" 

I just broke down. I started to cry and cry. All I could think was that I have become such a burden to my own family, why am I even here in this country? I don't have anywhere to go, or anyone to talk to. I don't have any friends here. I don't have anyone to talk to and when I do talk to people, they unexpectedly, say shit like this to me... I feel like my emotions aren't safe with other people.

I haven't reached this point in over 9 years. I thought, I was over this. I thought I was happy the last five years, but was I just being delusional? Was I a fool to think somebody like me could ever lead a normal life? Because I feel like the biggest idiot is me. It was different when my depression only affected me. I could have lived alone forever... But I didn't do that and now I'm a burden.

I used to abuse drugs for the longest time in hopes that it would ease the pain and it did for awhile until the drugs and partying was gone and then I was left with nothing but my feelings and being alone. I try to tell myself to be easy nowadays because that’s all I can really do at this point but it’s easier said then done. I have a pretty brutal story of my life if anyone would like to hear about it, maybe I can help others with opening up about what has gone on in my life and maybe someone will feel a little glimpse of hope for themselves. I just started getting on medications the past couple months and they help for a little while but they don’t ease the pain. They just kind of mask it until I’m laying in bed and I feel like my demons are waiting for me once I close my eyes. It’s hard to talk about this with my wife or anyone else in the matter because I feel like I burden them and I know everyone else has issues and I just don’t want to add more stress to them. I just don’t know what to do at this point if anyone has some advice, I would definitely love to hear it.",ElRoacho1988,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jht7ul/im_lost_at_this_point/,going horrible depression past couple year starting become draining affecting marriage relationship people around feel like sinking ship going boat like captain would used abuse drug longest time hope would ease pain awhile drug partying wa gone wa left nothing feeling alone try tell easy nowadays really point easier said done pretty brutal story life anyone would like hear maybe help others opening ha gone life maybe someone feel little glimpse hope started getting medication past couple month help little ease pain kind mask laying bed feel like demon waiting close eye hard talk wife anyone else matter feel like burden know everyone else ha issue want add stress know point anyone ha advice would definitely love hear,lost point,el roach 1988,1375,22,el roach 1988 going horrible depression past couple year starting become draining affecting marriage relationship people around feel like sinking ship going boat like captain would used abuse drug longest time hope would ease pain awhile drug partying wa gone wa left nothing feeling alone try tell easy nowadays really point easier said done pretty brutal story life anyone would like hear maybe help others opening ha gone life maybe someone feel little glimpse hope started getting medication past couple month help little ease pain kind mask laying bed feel like demon waiting close eye hard talk wife anyone else matter feel like burden know everyone else ha issue want add stress know point anyone ha advice would definitely love hear lost point

I feel bad but I refuse to change or get help,"I've been depressed for the past 4 years (but could've been longer, I just realized it 4 years ago). So I have this problem that I feel bad and alone most of the time, I feel sad and sometimes I have suicidal thoughts. The thing is, there were at least two people who reached out to me, but I refused their help because I thought it was stupid. One of them was telling me to believe in God and he will help me. Now I liked this person, you could say she was my crush. But in my opinion, believing in God is pointless, it just makes you sleep better but it's no different than deluding yourself. So she made at least 3-4 attempts to kind of help me, asking me if I want to talk but I refused. Why? Because I figured she will tell me the same things she did when we were messaging online, like ''believe in God'' and all that stupid religious stuff. I also couldn't really tell her that I don't believe in God anymore, as I wasn't sure how would she take it. Well it doesn't matter now, our last online exchange was when she linked me some Christian orchestra and I just replied with a lol. Well there's that for this person. The next person was my friend. He recently got really deep into self-improvement and all that bullshit, but I tried to be polite about it. He is also religious but not as much as my crush. To keep it short, he was always telling me that ''God has shown him the way'' and then his life turned around. I was like... yeah good for you, but in my heart I just sighed. I was just disappointed that even him was deluded like that. Of course I was told stuff like, open yourself up, meet new people, get a hobby. But I can't help myself, those things are such a waste of time. I don't really care to meet new people or get a hobby. These things are just a way to pass the time, I can do the same by just wasting my life at computer. I think my post got a bit sidetracked, but what you gonna do.

Think about internally painful experiences over and over? It's called RUMINATION. Here is how I largely stopped it...,"OK, first off, I am not a doctor. I'm just a guy who has been dealing with his own depression for the last 40+ years (20+ years treated for it).  Please seek medical help when you are willing and able to do something serious about treating this issue.  For just the technique, jump directly down to ""**The technique..."".**

Full disclosure: I've posted this before, but I described it with the term ""Intrusive Thoughts"".  In fact, it's actually called RUMINATION ([article](https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24444431)), andI wanted to repost here using the correct term in case someone is searching reddit for answers.  Plus, I'm editing the original post with some further observations and technique tweaks.

One of my most persistent symptoms is the host of ruminations I get. Specifically, the ones where your brain makes you think about painful or embarrassing things that happened in your past. It's like you can't help but have to sit there and relive it over and over again. It's been the toughest thing for me to get rid of because they are persistent (and, I finally realized, I've been training myself to ruminate for decades).

Anyway, I finally realized that I needed to break the cycle, and...to make a long story short...I have made a technique that actually seems to work. I've been using it for over a year now, and for this particular symptom, it seems to work pretty well.

**The technique...**

First off, the tough parts. You have to be **willing** to stop the cycle...you can get addicted to it without realizing it. Then, you have to start **realizing** that you are doing it, and try to realize it *as close to the moment that you start doing it*. I'm not kidding when I say that this is the toughest part, mostly because it means diverting your behavior into something that is new to you (which is never easy). If you can do this, you really are halfway there.

Next, you tell yourself that you don't have to live *in that moment*, but instead have to **live in the NOW**. Nobody can change the past, so you don't need to worry about it anymore. The thing that you keep ruminating on...well, even if it was public, nobody (NOBODY!) else remembers it.  ABSOLUTELY NOBODDY is keeping score except you, and you don't have *any* reason to continue doing it. This should be a little bit jarring, like it's shaking you awake, but *embrace the startling aspect of it*.  Realizing you are actually free from the responsibility of punishing yourself repeatedly is *supposed* to have a little emotional charge to it.  I think of it like a debt I incurred way back when it happened, and I then realize that not only was it a tiny debt to begin with, it was paid off a loooong time ago, but I'm continuing to make payments on it.  You wouldn't do that with your car payments, would you?  No, you wouldn't.  And this is more like buying a toaster on credit for $25, making payments for 20 years on it, and end up paying $30,000 over that time.  STOP MAKING THOSE PAYMENTS!  Get a little mad about it, and you'll build some momentum for doing something to stop it.

Finally, in this moment...distract yourself. Look for anything else to think about besides the intrusive thought that you were thinking about originally. This will keep you from immediately sliding back into the old pattern. I have found that, for me, thinking of a bunch of shallow topics in succession will do the trick. ""That's a pretty tree. Hey, I'm coming up on Main Street. That car has Florida plates. My feet are very warm right now. There's a grade school. I wonder what their mascot is."" ...You get the idea. Keep it up for a full minute if you can.

That's it, that's all there is to it. It took longer to explain it than it typically takes to do it (once you get good at realizing when it happens).

Maybe this has been done before, and the technique has already been invented. I honestly don't know, nor is it particularly important to me. I just want to put this out there in the hope that it might help someone else like it helped me.",virgilreality,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jht116/think_about_internally_painful_experiences_over/,ok first doctor guy ha dealing depression last 40 year 20 year treated please seek medical help willing able something serious treating issue technique jump directly technique full disclosure posted described term intrusive thought fact actually called rumination article http www bbc com news magazine 24444431 andi wanted repost using correct term case someone searching reddit answer plus editing original post observation technique tweak one persistent symptom host rumination get specifically one brain make think painful embarrassing thing happened past like help sit relive toughest thing get rid persistent finally realized training ruminate decade anyway finally realized needed break cycle make long story short made technique actually seems work using year particular symptom seems work pretty well technique first tough part willing stop cycle get addicted without realizing start realizing try realize close moment start kidding say toughest part mostly mean diverting behavior something new never easy really halfway next tell live moment instead live nobody change past need worry anymore thing keep ruminating well even wa public nobody nobody else remembers absolutely noboddy keeping score except reason continue little bit jarring like shaking awake embrace startling aspect realizing actually free responsibility punishing repeatedly supposed little emotional charge think like debt incurred way back happened realize wa tiny debt begin wa paid loooong time ago continuing make payment car payment would like buying toaster credit 25 making payment 20 year end paying 30 000 time stop making payment get little mad build momentum something stop finally moment distract look anything else think besides intrusive thought thinking originally keep immediately sliding back old pattern found thinking bunch shallow topic succession trick pretty tree hey coming main street car ha florida plate foot warm right grade school wonder mascot get idea keep full minute took longer explain typically take get good realizing happens maybe ha done technique ha already invented honestly know particularly important want put hope might help someone else like helped,think internally painful experience called rumination largely stopped,virgil reality,4026,117,virgil reality ok first doctor guy ha dealing depression last 40 year 20 year treated please seek medical help willing able something serious treating issue technique jump directly technique full disclosure posted described term intrusive thought fact actually called rumination article http www bbc com news magazine 24444431 andi wanted repost using correct term case someone searching reddit answer plus editing original post observation technique tweak one persistent symptom host rumination get specifically one brain make think painful embarrassing thing happened past like help sit relive toughest thing get rid persistent finally realized training ruminate decade anyway finally realized needed break cycle make long story short made technique actually seems work using year particular symptom seems work pretty well technique first tough part willing stop cycle get addicted without realizing start realizing try realize close moment start kidding say toughest part mostly mean diverting behavior something new never easy really halfway next tell live moment instead live nobody change past need worry anymore thing keep ruminating well even wa public nobody nobody else remembers absolutely noboddy keeping score except reason continue little bit jarring like shaking awake embrace startling aspect realizing actually free responsibility punishing repeatedly supposed little emotional charge think like debt incurred way back happened realize wa tiny debt begin wa paid loooong time ago continuing make payment car payment would like buying toaster credit 25 making payment 20 year end paying 30 000 time stop making payment get little mad build momentum something stop finally moment distract look anything else think besides intrusive thought thinking originally keep immediately sliding back old pattern found thinking bunch shallow topic succession trick pretty tree hey coming main street car ha florida plate foot warm right grade school wonder mascot get idea keep full minute took longer explain typically take get good realizing happens maybe ha done technique ha already invented honestly know particularly important want put hope might help someone else like helped think internally painful experience called rumination largely stopped

I feel like there is nothing i really enjoy anymore,"Last year I was depressed for about 8 months because i chased a girl that i wanted to be with all that time and she never gave me a clear no. I asked her out a total of 5 times only to get my confidence crushed, i was blind of obsession because i already invested so much time into my relationship with her so i kept getting my hopes up. Its been a whole year since this ended and i rarely think about it and when i do, i dont think about her but rather how dumb i was and how i got myself into that situation. Im almost 17 years old and as my friends all got girlfriends, i started feeling lonely, i dont know whats wrong with me that no girl i ever talk to wants to be with me, I think i have above average looks and i do my best to stay fit, but even if she does the first step and she tells me she has feelings for me, i still find a way to fuck it up. With all that happening, me having a bad relationship with my entire family and my daily cannabis use, i feel like i built a wall in my head, i dont get sad often, i never cry but i also never feel happy, i just feel neutral and im afraid of my daily routine, because i dont want to do and feel the same every single day but i dont know how to fix it.",Schnobby_,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhstkv/i_feel_like_there_is_nothing_i_really_enjoy/,last year wa depressed 8 month chased girl wanted time never gave clear asked total 5 time get confidence crushed wa blind obsession already invested much time relationship kept getting hope whole year since ended rarely think dont think rather dumb wa got situation im almost 17 year old friend got girlfriend started feeling lonely dont know whats wrong girl ever talk want think average look best stay fit even doe first step tell ha feeling still find way fuck happening bad relationship entire family daily cannabis use feel like built wall head dont get sad often never cry also never feel happy feel neutral im afraid daily routine dont want feel every single day dont know fix,feel like nothing really enjoy anymore,sch b,1208,51,sch b last year wa depressed 8 month chased girl wanted time never gave clear asked total 5 time get confidence crushed wa blind obsession already invested much time relationship kept getting hope whole year since ended rarely think dont think rather dumb wa got situation im almost 17 year old friend got girlfriend started feeling lonely dont know whats wrong girl ever talk want think average look best stay fit even doe first step tell ha feeling still find way fuck happening bad relationship entire family daily cannabis use feel like built wall head dont get sad often never cry also never feel happy feel neutral im afraid daily routine dont want feel every single day dont know fix feel like nothing really enjoy anymore
"Does getting on meds really ""make it worse before it gets better""?",I've been depressed for years. This is the first year I've decided to do something about it. I started seeing a therapist. It didnt seem like enough so I got prescribed Prozac.. it made me so nauseous I couldn't go to the gym anymore (the one healthy coping mechanism I had). I cant sleep anymore.  I take a nap during the day for an hour or so when I can't stand to stay awake but usually I just lie in bed with insomnia. Ive with it for weeks thinking the side effects would subside. I've continued taking the meds because I think my mental state might have actually improved. I dont think about killing myself anytime I get in a low state and I want to feel better. I started weaning off the prozac to start a different brand and I'm miserable again. All I want to do is drink and put a gun in my mouth. Is it the placebo effect and all in my head or what? I just want this shit to work without making me feel worse,n0st3p0nSn3k,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jho09f/does_getting_on_meds_really_make_it_worse_before/,depressed year first year decided something started seeing therapist didnt seem like enough got prescribed prozac made nauseous go gym anymore one healthy coping mechanism cant sleep anymore take nap day hour stand stay awake usually lie bed insomnia ive week thinking side effect would subside continued taking med think mental state might actually improved dont think killing anytime get low state want feel better started weaning prozac start different brand miserable want drink put gun mouth placebo effect head want shit work without making feel worse,doe getting med really make worse get better,n 0 st 3 p 0 n n 3 k,918,66,n 0 st 3 p 0 n n 3 k depressed year first year decided something started seeing therapist didnt seem like enough got prescribed prozac made nauseous go gym anymore one healthy coping mechanism cant sleep anymore take nap day hour stand stay awake usually lie bed insomnia ive week thinking side effect would subside continued taking med think mental state might actually improved dont think killing anytime get low state want feel better started weaning prozac start different brand miserable want drink put gun mouth placebo effect head want shit work without making feel worse doe getting med really make worse get better

I feel terribly stuck.,"Hey guys, sorry if anyone is going through a tough time, I hope you get better very very soon.


Here's what I've been going through and any advice is very welcome. I'm 17 and last year(Feb 2019) I attempted suicide after dealing with depression for 4 years. I was on medication, I had the support of my friends and family, etc. After the suicide attempt and an involuntary hospitalisation that lasted for 33 days I kinda got back to living my life, sorted out stuff that I needed to(a bunch of exams and stuff in school) and just..continued living. In June of 2019 I stopped taking medication and stopped visiting my psychiatrist completely. Honestly I fell back in love with life and managed to get myself out of that black hole. I made new friends, focused on my studies, this summer I even got my first summer job, I met my current boyfriend and recently I even lost my virginity. But I've been feeling worse and worse each passing day. I caught a cold, missed 4 weeks in school, and I haven't been able to focus on anything. I feel completely lost, scared that my mental health is getting worse, I've talked to some friends and family and everyone tells me I shouldn't stress about school that much but the thing is I just can't NOT stress because I'm terrified of failing yet I seriously just can't study. I have no trust in psychiatrists anymore so I don't want to seek professional help even though I suppose I should since I'm getting worse. I'm just so lost and confused and I feel so stuck. I've worked on building meaningful relationships, I have amazing friends and family, a boyfriend who treats me amazing, but I haven't felt joy in more than a month. I don't know what to do and how to pull myself out of this. The fatigue is almost unbearable and I've had two anxiety attacks out of nowhere in the last week. Any advice is very appreciated and welcome.

I'm fucking done,"I just went out with friends which wasn't that fun as they kept talking over me and I stopped talking after a while. Then my friend who was in the same fucking group chat that e discussed the outing on became passive aggressive because ""you didn't expect me to read over 200 texts"". It's not my fucking fault, she could've asked but no she had to make me feel like shit after being somewhat happy. Then after going home I started to take a heavy bag from the elevator to help out and my mom kept telling me to not grab it then she fucking shouted at me for trying to do something nice. She just fucking shouted and called me names. I didn't know trying to help is worth telling your daughter that she needs her neck broken. I already face enough problems emotionally that she has no clue about. I'm already in enough pain... I just need a dog for emotional support but my father hates all animals.

St John’s Wort to treat symptoms.. has this worked for anyone?,"My boyfriend suffers from pretty bad depression. It’s something he’s struggled with his whole life. While I have gone through depression myself, and still struggle at times.. but nothing like he deals with. He’s opened up to me about how he feel more and more, and it’s pretty dark stuff. He feels like his brain never shuts off, and just constantly spirals out of control. He has very dark thoughts, hates humanity and the society we have no choice to be apart of. He constantly feels like everything is too much to handle, like his life is just one bad things after another.. to the point where he just expects the absolute worst all the time so he’s slightly less disappointed when everything goes wrong, as he knows it will. He has abused drugs, and sometimes still does.. mostly speed, because he says it’s the only time he can get quiet in his head because of the sleep deprivation. 

This has been going on since he was a kid. He told his mom when he was younger that he had bad thoughts in his head that scared him, loosely hinting at suicidal thoughts without actually saying it to her, and she kind of just got mad at him.. in my opinion it scared her, and that’s just how she reacted unwilling.. she has a very different personality than he does, she’s a very strong independent individual (she’s an Aries like I am, so I get it in a way) She always just made the best of bad situations, I was always the same. I never let myself stress or worry about stuff I had no control over, I didn’t see the point.. it just causes you mental harm, when there’s nothing you can do to change it anyway. Even in my worst periods of depression, I was still able to try and see the light at the end of the tunnel, I always had a rough life, and horrific childhood.. But my depression was caused by an actual medical issue rather than being depressed due to my circumstances. I have a hormone imbalance so bouts of depression, and a bunch of other crappy symptoms are just part of my life... so I understand more about depression that I did before I was diagnosed with my health issues, which has made me more empathetic in a way.. By reacting the way his mother did, ended up doing more harm than anything, he told me it took him a lot to ask for help, and she made him feel like he couldn’t talk to her or ask for help ever again, from that point he never brought it up to anyone else again..until we started dating. 

Since COVID things have gotten so much worse for him, on top of that both of us has had such a an unbelievable string of bad luck, it honestly has been non stop problem after problem since summer 2019, we have been through so much, any human being who’s experienced even half the stuff we’ve had to deal with in the past year and a half would come out of it with severe depression, then dealing with COVID on top of all that.. I’m a strong person that can and has handled a lot in my life, and I’m struggling.. I can only imagine how he’s feeling.

For the first time since he was a kid he asked for help, he had a breakdown recently and told me he’s finally ready to try something.. but he’s not ready to see someone professionally, It really scares him. He always thinks of the worst possible outcomes, and his brain spirals with irrational thoughts, and he can’t stop or control it. He opened up about some of his fears to me, he’s terrified he will finally seek professional help, only to be told there’s nothing anyone can do, or that there’s nothing wrong with him, and that’s just how his brain works, and he’s just going to have to live like that the rest of his life, which in my opinion is highly unlikely.. but it’s something he’s legitimately afraid of. Also he’s afraid if he gets prescribed meds and they  will hinder his ability or loose interest in his creative passions. His one passion in life is music, and he’s insanely talented. His passion to create music is the one thing that’s kept him going throughout his life, it was his only form of escape and release from his mental health struggles. He always tells me that music was his only love in his life, until he met me, now he’s got two loves, and we (me and his passion for creating music) are the only things stopping him from just giving up and ending his life. He has no other dreams/goals career wise, not because he’s lazy, or lacks drive.. but because he was born with such natural musical talents and it’s the one thing he’s exceptionally good at, that isn’t a struggle for him to accomplish... He’s very far from an unintelligent person.. but he’s never been able to find anything else that he’s so effortlessly good at. He always had to work extra hard at everything else just to be half as good as others, and he really doesn’t enjoy doing other stuff. Music is the one thing he’s just naturally good at, and I’m genuinely not just saying this because he’s my boyfriend, he’s got actual serious talent, he’s been playing guitar since he was 11 years old, I know a lot of people who can play guitar, but the majority of people treat it as a hobby.. they learn a few songs to play for people at parties, and that’s it. He’s never been satisfied with just learning other people’s music.. and he doesn’t just play an instrument as a hobby, he’s a true genuine artist in every aspect. He needs to be creating, writing music, song lyrics, right down to drawing and designing his own album covers. He’s been teaching himself guitar almost his whole life, but when he decided to write and produce his own album rather that work with a band, his reason for this being having absolute control of all creative aspects without compromise on his own vision, he started creating drum tracks, bass lines, and vocals with no prior experience or knowledge beyond the guitar.. and being exceptionally talented at all of it. I was always amazed with talent he possesses, but his ability to effortlessly just be great at instruments he had zero prior knowledge of blew me away.. He’s also painfully aware that having a successful, and profitable career doing what he’s great at, just being talented isn’t enough, sometimes it is.. but it’s an industry where success, or even at least getting a somewhat decent career out of is more dependent on dumb luck, meeting the right person, being at the right place at the right time, or connections people may have in the industry already, rather than actually having talent, passion, drive and willingness to put in hard work... there’s the possibility he could spend his whole life working at something, genuinely putting everything he has into what he’s good at and end up with nothing to show for it. It’s an extremely unfair industry, and I know this is something he constantly struggles with, to him it’s unfair that the one gift he was born with is something that he has no absolutely control over being successful at, almost anything else can be accomplished by working hard enough, and by putting in genuine effort you will eventually accomplish what you set out to do, and having a natural talent for whatever it is gives you an advantage in that field. If you are blessed enough to have a natural for almost anything else, and you are dedicated enough, and want to peruse a career with whatever your good at you will succeed, even if it takes longer for whatever reason, there’s a clear path you can follow, you can create a plan, and an eventually reach an end goal that’s realistic, and guaranteed in the end. He sees musicians all the time that have managed a decent career in the industry, that have gotten famous, bands on the radio, and have just generally gotten lucky that aren’t half as talented as he is, and I really feel for him.. I would feel absolutely terrible if I was in a similar situation. Its so hard on him, it’s something he wants so badly, and he absolutely genuinely deserves to find success doing something that he loves, I feel like everyone deserves to love what they do in life, or at least have a legitimate shot at it, if you put so much time and effort into working towards something you should at least be granted a fair shot at being successful without having to rely on opportunity that may never happen, or just pure dumb luck. I can’t imagine having so much talent and love for doing something, while knowing no matter how hard I work at it there’s a huge possibility to waste my entire life just to never accomplish anything would crush me.. and I’m a very tough person, he’s not he’s extremely fragile compared to me.. 

I did some research online and I seen that some people have had some success with St John’s Wort... He wants help, but isn’t ready for doctors and prescribed medication.. even if he was ready for all that, COVID had made it more complicated to find a doctor and proper treatment at the moment. He agreed to try the St John’s Wort, but he’s very sceptical.. and generally being very pessimistic about it. He doesn’t feel like it will do anything, and doesn’t have high hopes at all.. he’s on his 3rd day of taking 300mg 3x/day which is what the bottle suggests. Can anyone share their experience that they have had with this supplement? Whether it was bad or good.. anything really to let me have somewhat of an idea on what to expect, how long before he may get some sort of results, or at least know how long to try taking them before giving up on it doing anything.. I don’t want him to not feel anything and stop too soon, how long of a chance should he give it to work. Honestly I’ve never loved another human being as much as I love him, I just wish there was more I could do.. but I know that’s not how this stuff works. I’ve survived though such a hard life, most of the times he even feels bad bringing up how he feels to me, because despite his mental health problems, he’s had a very happy life.. good caring family, and general stability in his life. Which is the complete opposite of what I have experienced. I had a drug addict, toxic, and mentally abusive mother, alcoholic, junkie, bipolar father. And a very unhealthy relationship with the rest of my family. I basically raised myself, and my parents.. because someone needed to be the responsible one, I was being the responsible one at the age of 6.. I have a lot of health complications, and no clear future.. I probably would have done something more stable, and productive with my life if I was given the opportunity.. I’m smart, outgoing, and have a lot of hidden talents.. but I was dealt a bad hand, and have lived a life of constant struggle. Opening up to me about what he’s struggling with makes him feel like he’s unjustified, like what he’s struggling with is nothing compared to the stuff I’ve survived through.. most people who know me are amazed I managed to grow up to be a somewhat functional human, and not a drug addicted fuck up like my parents tried to turn me into, while I have a lot of mental scars from my past I have ended up a stronger person because of it..  I know he feels bad because his life was candy land compared to mine. I reassure him all the time that I understand his mental health problems are real, and just because his life wasn’t hard like mine, doesn’t make his suffering any less legitimate, and he’s fully justified to feel how he feels. I understand hard times, and what I went through in life if anything helped me be strong enough to handle helping him through his dark times.. I wish just for a second he could see himself through my eyes, he would see how much he actually deserves in life. I care about him so much, and nothing would make me happier than to see him become the successful, talented, amazing person I know he’s more than capable of becoming. I would do absolutely anything for him, and I try and be the absolute most supportive girlfriend that has ever existed, because I’ve never met a more deserving

I lost my wife and I lost myself.,"Divorce is the hardest thing I've ever gone through in my entire fucking life. Like, it's completely destroyed every single wall and building block I've had in place for the past few years and I hate that I can't build these blocks back up.

Everything hurts more. Every little thing that I used to brush off just becomes some long, painful sting that takes forever to go away. Every single fucking night I just sit in bed, cry, drink, sob uncontrollably and claw at myself because I'm so fucking desperate to just *tell* someone I know how bad it's getting. It's been two months now. She's gone, the divorce is finalized, I pawned off my ring, I live with my mom again. She's already found a new girlfriend while I just sit and fucking putrefy in my own pain, suffering and sorrow. I went to a doctor, the doctor said that I'm depressed, he suggested therapy and pills. I declined, I feared them both. 

I just fucking scream every time I think about how *HAPPY* she is, and that I'm just some fucking husk that *sits there* crying and crying and *HURTING* over a girl that's just fucking gone. That won't come back, that won't fucking show a *SINGLE* care about me in the world. I feel so hopeless. I just desperately want her back, yet she couldn't give a *shred* of a fuck. A single... *Fucking* shred. 

Is this just it? Yknow, after you're divorced and you lose the love of your life. Is this all I have to look forward to? Some terrible life without a single person to turn to? 

What the fuck am I anymore? I don't know myself anymore. Every time I look at myself in the mirror. My acne covered face, my bagged eyes, my greasy matted hair, my neckbeard. All I see is the shaggy remains of what *used* to be a normal, happy man. 

*I miss the old me but I don't have the strength to bring him back.*

I'm sorry if this one came off as ranty and edgy, but I just really needed to let my feelings out.

But recently, the past several months, I don't think about death that often if ever. But when I picture myself in the future, I expect myself to die young from suicide. It really isn't a big deal to me. and I also wouldn't consider myself so sad anymore?? Like these past several months I'm just whatever? I rarely breakdown now.

"If I never really got myself checked, am I still really depressed?","My family’s not really in a good place financially. I’m feeling very depressed. I believe my depression started almost 8 years ago, and even though my family knows about it, I downplay it a bit just because I don’t want them to worry. I deal with it when I’m alone. Sometimes, how I deal with it turned to doing things that left me scars, physically and mentally. I also don’t want my family to spend money on me. I’m aware that this is my health, but I believe that our money can be put to better use than getting me professional help. In those years, I’ve never sought out a doctor nor even asked myself to get checked up. Because of this, I never really knew if I am truly depressed or not. 

I read about depression and have gotten really familiar with what it does to people, and I consider that what I feel is depression. I have high regards for medical practitioners in this field, so I’m sorry for diagnosing or labelling myself as “depressed”. I never really got meds for it, because of finances (again).

I’m having a crisis right now because of that. If I never really got myself checked, am I still really depressed? Believe me, I don’t want depression. It’s just hard to explain how I’m feeling during those days when I feel “depressed”, when I don’t really know if it’s actual depression or not.",im-potatokay,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhrsgp/if_i_never_really_got_myself_checked_am_i_still/,family really good place financially feeling depressed believe depression started almost 8 year ago even though family know downplay bit want worry deal alone sometimes deal turned thing left scar physically mentally also want family spend money aware health believe money put better use getting professional help year never sought doctor even asked get checked never really knew truly depressed read depression gotten really familiar doe people consider feel depression high regard medical practitioner field sorry diagnosing labelling depressed never really got med finance crisis right never really got checked still really depressed believe want depression hard explain feeling day feel depressed really know actual depression,never really got checked still really depressed,im potato kay,1309,66,im potato kay family really good place financially feeling depressed believe depression started almost 8 year ago even though family know downplay bit want worry deal alone sometimes deal turned thing left scar physically mentally also want family spend money aware health believe money put better use getting professional help year never sought doctor even asked get checked never really knew truly depressed read depression gotten really familiar doe people consider feel depression high regard medical practitioner field sorry diagnosing labelling depressed never really got med finance crisis right never really got checked still really depressed believe want depression hard explain feeling day feel depressed really know actual depression never really got checked still really depressed

I feel like no one believes me,"I feel like nobody believes me when I say I'm severely depressed... I'm 15 and maybe people just think it's a phase or something (and I'm definitely not as severe as before) but since I was 12 I've been diagnosed with both depression and anxiety (and I suspect I have bipolar disorder) and back then I just saw people as meat sacs, faked headaches or illnesses just to not attend school or get out of it, didn't see a point to anything in life (not to be edgy but I felt like if I'm going to die anyways what's the point of doing anything at all) and I feel so lonely...
I got practically 0 friends, my mom is the only one that takes me seriously and loves me, but she's constantly sick and I'm worried something serious is going on and I might lose her. Just the thought of not having my mom right here with me makes me break down crying.
If she's gone, I'm 100% killing myself if I'm at this emotional point. If I lose the most and only important person in my life then what am I going to do in this world?
Those are my worries. I know I seem so self aware about what's wrong with me but I'm just trying to pinpoint what happened with me.
I don't know, maybe I just need friends or whatever to not be so tied to my mom but I genuinely love her more than I have loved every single person in my life combined.

I always get sad when I think about my parent's relationship.,"My parents are in a rollercoaster of a relationship. They can be chill one day with my mom hugging and saying cute things with my dad. But then the next, they can loudly scream at each other over something that happened. My mom always seems to be blaiming things on my dad and in vice versa.

Now, whenever I see my mom being happy with my dad, I feel like something is off. An example: recently my dad had a car accident while being drink (DUI). They were super mad at each other for a few weeks and both said that they were going to make one or the other leave the house and never come back. This same thing happened 2 times in the past with them also saying they will get separated. But they never do. Some time will pass it they would forget about it completely and start acting like they love each other, if I can even call it that. 

I think that my mom is being all lovey with my dad just so they dont start fighting again or something like that idk. In the afternoon, my dad would go outside and drink with our neighbors and sometimes come back drunk. My dad isnt mad or violent when he is drunk, in fact he is more outgoing and more open when he is. This is what I fear the most. That my mom would accidentally say something negative about him and he would be open about it and turn angry and they would start fighting again. 

I have no idea where I am going with this but this relationship that I witness everyday just makes me so sad for both of my parents. Its makes me more sad when I think about it from their perspectives. God, why are my parents like this. I'm so damn confused and sad about it. I don't expect any responses this is just me venting or whatever.

I don't tend to expose my feelings or thoughts to anyone because everyone thinks I am happy all the time when in reality I get sad when I'm alone. I feel like I have to act like I'm happy sometimes because my family needs to be around happy people sometimes. I also do this around my friends because they also seem to be down sometimes. I always put others first instead of myself. This in turn leaves me with so much fucking emotions inside in my chest that sometimes it hurts. Like a weight and I feel like I just need to let this go somewhere. And no I don't feel like talking about it to anyone because everyone knows that I'm very happy and i don't have any mental issues. My 13 year old sister is diagnosed with anxiety and I feel like the only reason I dont have any of this is because I pushed it so fucking deep in the back of my chest. I feel like it's starting to catch up to me as I constantly feel an ache in my chest and I won't eat properly. 

All I have to do is push it farther back right? Pretend like everything is good right? Jesus, writing this makes me even sadder. The thing is, I don't  have suicidal thoughts or anything, I just feel like I'm huddled in a corner in the dark. I feel like screaming rn. But I'll worry about it later because I have overdue assignment to turn in. 

I'm only sad sometimes but when I get sad, I get really really sad. I don't even know if I'm sad or not. I just feel nothing, just an ache in my chest. Am I depressed? I don't think so. Maybe. I feel like I dont have feelings anymore. 

Idk how I took this post this way but I'm glad if someone was able to read through it. It's my first time talking about my thoughts and it already hurts. I might not do it again. Idk what to do.

I randomly thought about past events that I know I can’t change and the despair I tried to fight off has returned.,"Hello my name is Nasir and this is my first time using reddit. I just needed a place to vent and get some opinions and advice on my situation from different people. Before I turned 18 (I am 24 now but giving a little backstory) my life was like any normal person. I had just graduated high school and felt good about that. I like to think that I am very intelligent but I graduated with an average gpa (2.5). I could have done better but I was a huge procrastinator and am very forgetful in general so that didn’t help either. I now realize what my teachers and grandparents told me about “not applying myself”. They held me to higher expectations because they knew my potential, what I could do if I actually tried. But I didn’t listen. I didn’t look towards the future I lived in the moment. “I don’t feel like doing this work so I won’t”, is what I constantly thought to myself or I would just honestly forget to do it or wait until the day before so it was half done. My gpa when I graduated was the result of me not applying myself. It is an average gpa, yes but I could have done so much better. It’s funny when I like look back on it now but I was so lazy I almost failed English and P.E. quite possibly two of the easiest A’s in the curriculum. I didn’t take it seriously which was my mistake. After highschool I enrolled to Purdue University in Indiana. I live on the state line so it was a 10 minute drive from my house. My grandfather would take me because I didn’t have my own car or a license (still don’t). Even though it is so close I still live in Illinois so I was charged for out of state tuition which was very unfortunate. The change from high school to college was not as drastic as I thought it would be but I get extreme anxiety in new environments and when I have to meet new people so my heart was beating extremely fast. I also overanalyze every aspect of every conversation I have and I feel as if every person I make eye contact with even for a fraction of a second is judging me but I’ve always been like that. Up until recently (probably the last 2 years) I have gotten over that feeling but the social anxiety is still there and being nervous in new environments. Even talking online makes me nervous. I wasn’t going into college blind either, I knew I had to apply for financial aid and scholarships and grants to help pay for my tuition and possibly get a job; but just like high school I didn’t take it seriously and instead of working I would skip classes to go play video games with my friends. The difference between them and me is they probably had free time to actually play. I was supposed to be doing my work. I didn’t go to college to play games I went to try and get a higher education that would open career pathways. I had my entire life planned out when I was 18 but we can all agree that life sometimes doesn’t work out the way you plan it to. Just like high school I was living in the moment and not looking towards the future, blind to the fact that time is always moving. Before I knew it, the end of the semester was upon me. My tuition for the semester was 9k. FAFSA covered half but I didn’t apply for any scholarships/grants and I certainly didn’t have a job. I could have taken out a loan but I wasn’t thinking about any of that. My grades were also terrible as well due to what I stated earlier: not putting school as my first priority. I couldn’t pay the tuition so I dropped out. I feel as if all of this could have been avoided if I gave myself a reality check but it was too late. That’s when I started to first feel depressed. Well it was more so nihilism. I came to the realization that I have to work the rest of my life just to die making everything I ever accomplished useless. Some people really see no issue with this because it’s just a normal thing but that’s a conversation for another day. After I dropped out I started looking for jobs. No luck. That is what made me REALLY depressed; I just want a job just to earn some money and try to change my quality of life but I couldn’t find one and still can’t. Covid-19 turning into a pandemic didn’t help my case either. Not only that but I had some family issues going on during my last year of high school to the dropout period up until even now. My father was doing parole at our house (he is no longer here thank God) and he’s extremely racist, homophobic and misogynistic, but mainly misogynistic. His general distrust and degradation of women angers me seeing as I was raised by one (my grandmother) and I turned out just fine so the “a man can’t raise a women” argument is stupid. He is a part of my depression because I failed driver’s ed in high school (it was a free class for us) because of him and I could have had my driver’s license by now if he didn’t ruin it. He went out one day and when he came home he hit me because the dishes weren’t washed (I forgot to wash them) and his following statement was “Your grandma shouldn’t have to come home from work to wash dishes.” I agree, she shouldn’t have to come home from work to wash dishes but every time I try to help around the house she doesn’t want me to. She’s been a working woman all of her life if she wanted help she would ask. I did other housework like mopping and taking out the trash anyway. Back to the hitting part. I wear glasses so when he hit me it was just enough force to break my glasses and I’m like Velma when I don’t have my glasses, I can only see about 6 inches in front of me before everything gets blurry. After he broke my glasses he told me not to tell my grandma so I didn’t because I was scared of him. I’m sure you know I can’t get behind the wheel with my type of vision. This was near the end of the course where driving tests were becoming more frequent and I wouldn’t be able to get a new pair of glasses or even contacts in enough time so I failed. I have resented him ever since. I never felt any emotion towards him anyway because the time in my life to form that bond has long since passed. Maybe something could have been salvaged if I was 13-16 but it’s too late. So all that combined with me not being able to find a job has taken its toll on me. I was doing fine for a while because I didn’t stay focused on my past and how it turned out but I randomly started thinking about it and I just started breaking down and crying. This one job I applied to was going to hire me but this was when Covid has just started so they turned everyone down and now I’m still looking. I could have went back to school but I have no motivation to do so anymore. My Pastor always tells me I don’t need to go to college which is true, there are other options but like I said before the realization of working for the rest of my life just to die has really demotivated me from doing anything. I guess I do have a goal though. If I get a job I would like to save money for a PC and become a streamer so I guess that’s a start but right now I’m in a limbo. If my grandmother were to die (God forbid) I would be hopeless because she pays the bills for the house and keeps me fed. It’s because of the appreciation I have for her taking care of me even now is why I feel useless to her even though she has expressed the opposite multiple times. I feel like a burden because I don’t have a source of income. She is retired and has to work with $1200 a month. I don’t want her to spend the rest of her life living like that. That is why I feel so powerless to help her and to help myself. I apologize that this post is so long I just needed vent a little. My friends and family (well my grandpa is clueless) have a general idea of how I feel but haven’t really given me the comfort I envisioned they would due to me not being able to properly express my emotions. I have NEVER felt this way before so the overwhelming despair and depression I felt was a first for me and now it has returned. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this. A response is not required but welcomed all the same.

I don’t know what to do,My life’s going pretty “good” I got a great girl who’s the absolute love of my life I’m in university blah blah blah I got a bright future ahead of me..

I had a bad day,"Long post. It's just a vent.

I take meds to help me sleep through the night. Sometimes they put me in a deep sleep for around 12 hours if I take it too late in the night. I have nightmares every night but last nights nightmares were hitting me hard emotionally, and playing on every part I hate about myself. 

I woke up and immediately cried. I went to go watch a movie to calm myself down, but my roommate was there along with his girlfriend and friend. I tried to watch a movie but they kept interrupting, and left random clothes and items around the living room and I guess that was my last straw. Every issue I had with my roommate bubbled up and i was just furious. It's like, my roommate became my roommate even though I told the other people in the apartment that I didnt want him there, because he made my friends uncomfortable. I cant get an emotional support animal because he hates animals. I have to ask permission to invite people over but he brings his gf over whenever the hell he wants. I cant invite my close friends over because he makes them uncomfortable. He complains about me being messy then he and his girlfriend leave beer bottles everywhere and just throw shit where they want. I don't know how to put it any other way, but I despise him now. 

I texted my boyfriend (who is also a roommate) to vent and he told me it was irrational. We argued and I ended the conversation by telling him he could keep the roommate, but that I was leaving. Then I grabbed my phone, backpack and wallet and sort of ran away. It was snowy, so I hid under some pine trees and planned to go to the nearby grocery store and buy some pills that I could overdose on.

 This whole time I'm completely irrational, haven't brushed my hair, wearing mismatched socks, and crying under a pine tree. I dont know what was going on, but i was panicking but not in a panic attack way. It was like my brain was furious and wanted to end it all. My therapist told me I have ""subconscious suicidal ideation"" but I've never actively tried to harm/kill myself, but today I had a big urge to. I sat outside under the pine trees until I was so cold my body didnt want to move anymore, but I got up anyways.

For some reason, i didnt stop at the grocery store,  i kept walking until i reached my work. My coworkers were nice to me even though I looked like a maniac, and they tried to cheer me up. It was sweet. I stayed at a local coffee shop. I went there with the intention of drawing, but I just stared at the table for about an hour instead. My boyfriend called me until I answered, then picked me up. I threw up when I got home and we talked it out on the bathroom floor. 

I dont know what happened. It felt like I was asleep but my emotions were so intense. It didnt feel real. I don't feel real. What the fuck is wrong with me. I dont want to die I think but today I was going to.",HeyThtsGr8,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhogi6/i_had_a_bad_day/,long post vent take med help sleep night sometimes put deep sleep around 12 hour take late night nightmare every night last night nightmare hitting hard emotionally playing every part hate woke immediately cried went go watch movie calm roommate wa along girlfriend friend tried watch movie kept interrupting left random clothes item around living room guess wa last straw every issue roommate bubbled wa furious like roommate became roommate even though told people apartment didnt want made friend uncomfortable cant get emotional support animal hate animal ask permission invite people brings gf whenever hell want cant invite close friend make uncomfortable complains messy girlfriend leave beer bottle everywhere throw shit want know put way despise texted boyfriend also roommate vent told wa irrational argued ended conversation telling could keep roommate wa leaving grabbed phone backpack wallet sort ran away wa snowy hid pine tree planned go nearby grocery store buy pill could overdose whole time completely irrational brushed hair wearing mismatched sock cry pine tree dont know wa going wa panicking panic attack way wa like brain wa furious wanted end therapist told subconscious suicidal ideation never actively tried harm kill today big urge sat outside pine tree wa cold body didnt want move anymore got anyways reason didnt stop grocery store kept walking reached work coworkers nice even though looked like maniac tried cheer wa sweet stayed local coffee shop went intention drawing stared table hour instead boyfriend called answered picked threw got home talked bathroom floor dont know happened felt like wa asleep emotion intense didnt feel real feel real fuck wrong dont want die think today wa going,bad day,hey th sgr 8,2883,15,hey th sgr 8 long post vent take med help sleep night sometimes put deep sleep around 12 hour take late night nightmare every night last night nightmare hitting hard emotionally playing every part hate woke immediately cried went go watch movie calm roommate wa along girlfriend friend tried watch movie kept interrupting left random clothes item around living room guess wa last straw every issue roommate bubbled wa furious like roommate became roommate even though told people apartment didnt want made friend uncomfortable cant get emotional support animal hate animal ask permission invite people brings gf whenever hell want cant invite close friend make uncomfortable complains messy girlfriend leave beer bottle everywhere throw shit want know put way despise texted boyfriend also roommate vent told wa irrational argued ended conversation telling could keep roommate wa leaving grabbed phone backpack wallet sort ran away wa snowy hid pine tree planned go nearby grocery store buy pill could overdose whole time completely irrational brushed hair wearing mismatched sock cry pine tree dont know wa going wa panicking panic attack way wa like brain wa furious wanted end therapist told subconscious suicidal ideation never actively tried harm kill today big urge sat outside pine tree wa cold body didnt want move anymore got anyways reason didnt stop grocery store kept walking reached work coworkers nice even though looked like maniac tried cheer wa sweet stayed local coffee shop went intention drawing stared table hour instead boyfriend called answered picked threw got home talked bathroom floor dont know happened felt like wa asleep emotion intense didnt feel real feel real fuck wrong dont want die think today wa going bad day
Dear little black book," 24/10

I'm drunk, I'm miserable, maybe I'm an alcoholic but I feel more comfortable this way. I chain smoked but no one can know because I am the strong one, the reliable one that gives the best advice to stay strong, the one who doesn't give a shit what my family thinks, whose broken heart can't defeat. It's all lies that I tell everyone and myself.

I miss the person who broke my heart, I miss my best friend who wont talk to me and we were friends since I was 7 years old and it still fucking hurts. Everyone here lies, I am no saint either. I wish those who hurt me suffered at some point, I wish they still thought of me from time to time like I think of them. I wonder if they would care if they found out I committed suicide.

That's why I need to go on this journey, to figure out who I really am, maybe I am a toxic wretch but at least I would know. ""Tiramnia"" needs to die so who I really am can live.

How do you deal with your unexplained internal rage?,"As a psych and brain science major you'd think I'd be able to shuffle through my own notes and figure out why I'm so angry and bothered all the time. However, after repeated trial and error I cease to understand my own brain. Im angry, Im bothered, Im just plain tired. Internally I want to scream. Externally I look unbothered. 

I take meds yet it does't seem to work. I try to change my mindset and even that is a temporary fix. This whole fake it til you make it shit is really taking its tole on me. Is it the loneliness? The heaviness of being a single parent? Everyone else's needs from me? All of the fucking above? I'M PISSED. 

But what am I angry about? Why does everything bother me? Why do the tasks in my life continue to pile on and only get half completed by me? A rather hard question to answer. Something is not right with me. But that's a given eh?

Wish I could drown in tears and alcohol but what good would that do me? I need to change more. Change more of myself, my mindset. Set more boundaries. Free up time to do what I enjoy. Change my career. (What a depressing place to be). 

I have so much potential and I'm not even tapping into half of it. 

I want to hibernate and come out a new woman. I just feel stuck.

Depressed from having screwed up my growth and health in general.,"I've been depressed for a while from the fact that I assume I've screwed up my height growth. The story is short, last year I was from June to March of this year smoking, drinking, taking xanax, taking nbome (acid), and smoking marijuana. Obviously some of these substances must have screwed up my height growth, but because of the pandemic I cannot go to the doctor to confirm it. The truth is that all that happened because of a depression that is still in force, it was 9 months of trying to escape from the depression by using drugs, then I reconsidered and left everything, except the depression haha. Also the brain damage that I surely also generated, but of that I cannot be sure. Height was always important to me, not too much, but now that I have reflected on the damage caused, it makes me very depressed to know that I was able to grow taller and that I could have been physically better. Obviously when you are depressed, anything can sink you, no matter how minimal, and the truth is that I have been thinking about this every day for 3 weeks. I do not expect you to solve my life with a cute phrase, but at least telling this and that they provide me with a comment helps me.

Self-Esteem,"My self-esteem this month has been the lowest it has ever been, but to be honest I have made such an improvement that I feel like a different person, I see the light at the end of the tunnel, I see a purpose even tho its just fantasies at the moment, I believe with enough faith it will be true.
I was suicidal, I still am but I tell myself life is hard, everyone has barriers that exhaust us so much that we barely have any strength or will left to get up and fight back. I think about suicide in a daily basis but the only difference from earlier this month is that I don't wish it anymore, I appreciate my life right now, it could be only a phase but I have set an objective to myself, keep fighting until I literally can't. 2 days ago I made a new table for my pc (even tho I don't have a monitor lol) all with used parts and nails, my father reminded me like 50 times that I won't be able to build it, but I kept saying ""its ok, I'll try anyway"" and I never had that mentality before, I would always give up when someone told me that they had no faith in me, and that proved me that the faith of the people in you, in no way describes you for who you are, I said ok everytime and I kept going until I made a brand old (new) table all on my own, stable, strong and most importantly SELF MADE.
Don't mind peoples opinions, agree with them but keep going, it doesn't have to be perfect, it will give you enough satisfaction knowing you made it yourself. Be proud, be nice to yourself, love yourself, your own creation.
Low self-esteem for me comes from fear and stress because I'm afraid people think I'm not good enough. 2 days ago I realised that what I can see, others can't and that makes me keep going, my own journey, my own choices, my own life, I matter just as you do, keep going, even if its the hardest thing you do, its worth it.",whatdoinamedis,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhqhc5/selfesteem/,self esteem month ha lowest ha ever honest made improvement feel like different person see light end tunnel see purpose even tho fantasy moment believe enough faith true wa suicidal still tell life hard everyone ha barrier exhaust u much barely strength left get fight back think suicide daily basis difference earlier month wish anymore appreciate life right could phase set objective keep fighting literally 2 day ago made new table pc even tho monitor lol used part nail father reminded like 50 time able build kept saying ok try anyway never mentality would always give someone told faith proved faith people way describes said ok everytime kept going made brand old new table stable strong importantly self made mind people opinion agree keep going perfect give enough satisfaction knowing made proud nice love creation low self esteem come fear stress afraid people think good enough 2 day ago realised see others make keep going journey choice life matter keep going even hardest thing worth,self esteem,doi named,1843,11,doi named self esteem month ha lowest ha ever honest made improvement feel like different person see light end tunnel see purpose even tho fantasy moment believe enough faith true wa suicidal still tell life hard everyone ha barrier exhaust u much barely strength left get fight back think suicide daily basis difference earlier month wish anymore appreciate life right could phase set objective keep fighting literally 2 day ago made new table pc even tho monitor lol used part nail father reminded like 50 time able build kept saying ok try anyway never mentality would always give someone told faith proved faith people way describes said ok everytime kept going made brand old new table stable strong importantly self made mind people opinion agree keep going perfect give enough satisfaction knowing made proud nice love creation low self esteem come fear stress afraid people think good enough 2 day ago realised see others make keep going journey choice life matter keep going even hardest thing worth self esteem
Struggling to cope with medication changes. Not sure what to expect. Insight / experiences appreciated.,"My psych started me off with 10 mg lexapro but the side effects were off the charts for me and he gave me xanax for the first week to cope with Severe anxiety and panic attacks telling me this reaction is normal. 

Side effects became less intense after two weeks tried it for 4 weeks total and no improvement.

Added 150 mg buproprion then and felt an instant improvement. Tapered of the lexapro and 2 months into 150 mg bupoprion in the mornings and 150 in the evening now (SR). Have noticed  a significant improvement in mood, motivation and focus but the insomnia is still in full swing and I get super vivid dreams when I do get any sleep. Afternoon exhaustion and late night racing thoughts. Tinnitus and nausea to the point i have no appetite. Try to make it through on smoothies and juices but that is a struggle to keep down those too. 

Doc said to stick with this regime though for another month?

*To be noted I had bad insomnia and anxiety with the depression so I have been told it is hard to treat and trial and error are required with finding the correct medication? Was so terribly afraid to start treatment with that experimentation as I have body dysmorphia and gaining any weight would be a nightmare to me on top of this at the moment.

Please read this,"Depressed and anxious

I am new to reddit — I’ve been browsing around for a while now, but I’ve lacked the courage to post anything. I can relate to a lot of what has been posted, and I now feel like it’s time that I share my story:

I grew up in a chaotic household (like I’m sure a lot of you have): my mother was mentally unstable given my father lacked a steady income and was constantly finding and experimenting with entrepreneurial projects that failed to provide our family with any steady source of income. My most vivid memories (when I can actually remember, which is difficult when you have MDD) are my parents fighting constantly about mortgage payments, infidelity on business trips, and lack of extended family support. My parents divorced when I was 12 — I I lived in multiple houses growing up with my mom, and my dad has been in and out of my life ever since, though he’s been more involved these past couple of years (I actually lived on his couch from 25 to 26).

However, fortunately, I was able to push through (or ignore)a lot of these family problems growing up, though I was still considered weird by a lot of people my age. I was an excellent high school student: I graduated with a 4.2 gpa and played two sports in which I was a captain for one them senior year. I went on to an elite private college on the east coast in which I played a varsity sport for 4 years. I had an amazing gf who I loved very much (we were together for 4 years in college, and one year after). I was confident and genuinely believed in myself: I didn’t have a fake belief in myself, but a deep love and care for myself. I graduated with a solid gpa as well as a couple of awards for both sports and academics.

After I graduated, my life spiraled out of control: I became deeply, deeply depressed and started to hate my self, a hatred so deep words cannot describe how I felt. I was stuck at a job that meant nothing to me, and spent my weekends indulging in alcohol and marijuana (my brain doesn’t react well to either of those substances). Each day I started to feel more and more “out of it”, emotionally numb, and dysphoric: I felt nothing, there was nothing to live for, and I stopped enjoying everything that used to bring me meaning and joy. I quit my job after 7 months, and I moved back home, leaving behind everything that I worked hard for: a job, friends that respected me, and a loving gf. 

After moving back, I was EXTREMELY heart broken after leaving my ex: I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t able to be the rock and support system for her anymore, I couldn’t understand why I felt so emotionally numb, and I couldn’t understand why there wasn’t any intimacy or passion in the sex or relationship anymore. I started to question my entire existence and identity, and I fell into the darkest depression a person could fall into: I literally questioned everything — I didn’t know my name, my gender, where I was born, my sexual orientation. Nothing felt real — I couldn’t tell real memories from fake memories. I had no sense of self which was slowly destroying me. 

Fast forward a year - I was living at home, unemployed and miserable. I ended up taking the GRE and applied to a graduate program at an Ivy League school. Got in, did that, but I still hated my self the whole time (depression, dysphoria, anxiety) it was just that I was able to hide it and distract myself in academics.

After getting my grad degree, I moved home, and I failed to keep in contact with everyone I met in school. Again, the cycle continued: depressed, dysphoric, unemployed, anxious, living at home, and lonely. I couldn’t figure out how to hold on to a job or even find one; I just wanted to go back to school again for the third time, take out more loans, and become further in debt. I stopped caring completely, about everything.

I started to watch porn, have sex with random girls to boost my self esteem (it never did) and drink heavily, and I also got into COCAINE, which completely destroyed me: I felt worthless and lost before, oh boy did cocaine just absolutely fuck me up. My delusions and dysphoria started to worsen: my life goal was to become a cocaine dealer in Mexico (started looking at plane tickets) or a lady boy in Thailand. My entire sex drive was in ruins: I had nothing solid to hold onto, again, a very fragile self image around who I was as human being with very intense dysphoria. For example, I would have repeated videos in my brain of being raped over and over again: I genuinely believed I was a victim of childhood rape, but there is no evidence of that. I went on a cocaine and alcohol binge one night, and the only thing I remember is the next morning being driven to the emergency room: I had gotten the shit beat out of me at the bar, been handcuffed  by the cops, driven home by them, and started threatening to kill myself as well as my entire family. At the emergency room, I had an insanely high blood alcohol content as well as cocaine in my system (even the day after). I talked to the social worker/psychologist there, and he determined that I was suicidal and delusional, so he put me in the schizophrenic unit of the psych ward for three days, but after the first day I was moved to the major depression and anxiety unit as they believed that was a better fit. 

I got out after 4 or 5 days, and I went to see a mental health professional voluntarily for the first time since I was a child: I saw a psychologist when I was young, but that was it. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic features, and I was prescribed Abilify and Lexapro. I had been taking both for about a year and a half; however, I went cold turkey on the Lexapro two or three weeks ago and tapered off the Abilify myself a month and a half ago: I just couldn’t stand the weight gain ( I probably gained 50 lbs) and it really didn’t make me feel at peace with myself, it was a bandaid, and I genuinely knew that from the bottom of my heart.

Moved back to the Ivy League town where I graduated from, and I was able to find a job doing consulting work (think about one of those jobs that only rich connected people get); but I quit after 8 months because I wanted to become a professional poker player. I moved to Las Vegas, got an apartment, and started playing at the casinos. Covid happened, I lost my money, and moved back home again. Again, cycle repeats itself. 

I recently found a job in another state doing bullshit office work: think Dilbert or Office Space. But, I have come to terms with it, and I’m doing my best to find joy in the little things. I have completely quit alcohol: it’s not even an option. I’m done with it, forever. Drugs and alcohol absolutely crush me. 

I still have intense bouts of crippling depression and anxiety attacks which I’ve come to realize are fueled by my inability to understand who I am or hold onto any sort of solid self image of myself at the deepest level: this prevents me from seeking out genuine relationships with other people, whether that be friends or a significant other. I am still questioning all aspects of my self: Am I straight or gay? Am I male or female? Where am I from? What is my name? Who are my family members? Memories don’t seem real, nothing seems real anymore. It’s wearing me down, and I can’t imagine that a person could go through so much pain and still exist. It’s a miracle.

I’m seeing a new psychiatrist, and I am hopeful he will help. I’ve been stable before, relatively content and at peace with myself; I am hoping to get back to that place again. I can’t give up.

Thanks for reading.

Any tips to lower social anxiety and panic attacks in social situations?,"I usually find myself very anxious and/or nervous when I am around people. Sometimes making movements like shaking my arms or snapping my fingers can help calm me down, but it makes me feel stupid in front of everyone.

“Fake it till you make it”,"I hate this phrase, so fucking much. Like I actually get angry at this point when people say it to me.

I’ve heard it so many times from colleagues, friends, and mentors. Repeated over and over.

There’s just so many things wrong with it and I hate that it’s such a common piece of ‘advice’ these days.

You’re literally telling me to be someone I’m not, to project a fake persona, just to meet the needs of what we see as ‘normal’ social interaction. Confidence is a feeling, it’s not something you can train easily if at all. Some people are predisposed to be quieter and less assertive and that’s OK... except it isn’t to some people, who expect everyone else to always be just as confident as they are in speaking, even if what they say is nonsense. 

Faking confidence is mentally exhausting, draining, and not something which some of us can do easily. It’s hard putting on a show like that for hours on end and it hurts being someone I’m not.

I’m sad and idk if it’s temporary life stuff or becoming a new way of life. What to think of my “friends”,"This caption is absolutely the story of my life right now. Insomnia has kicked in too. I don’t understand why I’m like this right now. All of my past or more recent reasons for sadness have dissolved. Those being namely my messy breakup with ex or nicotine addiction this past year. Yet, Nowadays, I feel like my friends have alienated me, blatant acts of being dodgy to plans or just flat out talking bad about me behind my back. I still have a few good ones, real ones, left but they all live in the city I moved away from for college. 

I’m left in my room playing video games to pass the time. Coming in late on many of my class assignments. Getting absolutely bum nothing done. I work only to pay the bills. Never before in my life have I felt a ‘fuel tank’ of socializing in my body. It takes days for me to refill it up just to have lunch with somebody, before dipping back into this dark peril of no energy for anybody or myself. 

Bipolar runs in my family. I fear I have it but never before a year ago have I felt so much immobilizing sadness and self-hatred/doubt. I get nothing done because I’m depressed, and I’m depressed because I get nothing done. 

Today, I was supposed to have game night with my former roommates. I was actually quite excited at the prospect, even with my ex being a part of the group I originally introduced her to. After a year, her and I are civil. Ironically these are the same “friends” she poorly criticized during our breakup, but whatever I guess they’re hunky dory now. I drove home from a weekend of visiting my parents specifically for this event, 2 1/2 hrs. A few texts out to the members go by and I get little structured response. I ask one of them early afternoon.. 

Me: hey let’s get dinner before everyone shows up, I’m hungry. Also want to watch the big10 game?

“Friend”: sure hold up let us decide. 

Half hour goes by

Me: hey little bird what’s the word. 

“Friend”: ur beat

I find out they all went to a brewery with my ex prior to the game night we had planned. I wouldn’t be surprised if her new bf was in attendance, and so I totally understand why they would want to keep us separate, but still a stabbing blow. 

I text my ex

Me: hey what time should I show up tonight?

Her: Idk really I’m getting food at the moment. Ask friend 1 or friend 2.

I know she’s sitting next to friend #2 while beating this response around the bush. 

At this point I just feel like a tool. Not the first time. The pain is too much and I decide to call it quits on going. I make plans with a girl I’ve been talking too and we actually have a pretty good night at the bar and watching anime back at her place.

We have no Freedom,"Who cares? We have no freedom. We are all slaves to the global elites that want to leech our talents from us and then sell it for a price and they were here first and will always be ahead of anyone else or you are slaves to your parents. The internet has become boring because there is a lack of connection. I just want to be put out of my suffering for good. I wish that euthanasia was legal for people with mental disorders.

My parents have robbed me of my childhood through abuse and corporal punishment from teachers as well as them(yes I was forced to go around naked in front of everyone and hit with a cane and told to touch my feet if I didn't follow the teachers orders) and the teachers/parents and uncle all got away with it.

My parents are narcissist/toxic but they give me a roof over my head but they are so controlling and treated me as their slave/property rather than a loving child and abused the shit out of me by slapping me and claim to 'love me, plus with the on going health problems, I don't think I want to live on anymore. I just wish suicide was easier and painless as possible.

We are slaves to the global elites and corporate fascists that rule this world. It's their way or the highway.'Despite the shit they have done I still love them because I am too human but fuck this.

I don't want kids. Fuck having kids. It seems like a very selfish. I wish that school never existed because it robs people of their freedom and turns everyone into obedient workers and slaves to the elites.

I am a grown ass man crying in my bedroom HAHAHAHAHA!! I pass out while lying in bed and almost have become forgetful but we have to keep marching right? I don't even remember how old I am anymore. To me life feels like a bad nightmare that you keep on going and going. 

Whenever I hear my dad speak I get frightened because his loud obnoxious voice scares me. There is no way out other than to wear out the storm. I don't want to expose myself because the internet is owned by these capitalist that want to rob people of their freedom but give the the idea that you have freedom when the internet was just invented to sell more products and sell a fantasy to people and not actually benefiting humanity as a whole.

As if being in the car accident wasn't enough for my parents, they refuse to listen to me and then I get called a freeloader from my brother form leeching from them when I have always put their interest ahead of mine but then get accused for having tragedy in my life. They also don't understand what I am going through right now.

And to think that quality of life is going to improve is honestly just silly I’ve been diagnosed depressed but my family and I have known its been there for years before I don’t want to take meds I’ve seen they either don’t help or turn people into something they’re not . A lot of the reasons my life hasn’t panned out the way it was projected to be from birth doesn’t even have anything to do with me rather other people’s choices around me yet I’m not one to blame others for the way my life turned out it’s just the facts consisting of things I’ve literally whitenessed my self or things that where happening that people tried to hide from me bit I caught onto anyway. I plan on breaking up with my girlfriend whom I love so much so I don’t have to worry her anymore and I can just end things peacefully if things go as planned this will probably be one of my last social media presences I don’t cry why typing things like this rather I smile I’m so young yet there’s not much to look forward to yeah I could go get a job and move away and be bored out of my mind with the same person for the rest of my life but maybe we’ll have some kids that are born and develop depression as well because mommy and daddy aren’t having the best time either or maybe the kid will get stolen by some sex trafficker who really knows the worlds out to get ya haha. Have fun y’all I know a lot of you have on here still got hope, there’s still a happiness, an ignorant side to you which will numb you throughout these days.

Life has become unbearable,"I just don't see the point. Why am I here just to suffer? All I ever do is work, and when I dont work I try to recover from tge sleep deprivation caused by a mix of day and night shifts.  I just want to be able to rest for a bit. But I'm a slave to the company. So what is the point? What is the meaning of such a life???

If only I had a girlfriend to support me in these dark times it wouldn't be so bad. But I'm a 25 years old hugless, kissless virgin and that alone is enough to make me despair.That is just a part of my suffering, but still, is life even worth living without love? 

Anyway I don't know if it's because of what I mentionned or if it's because my circadian rythm got destroyed by my job (I heard it could affect moods) but I'm just so depressed.  I don't enjoy anything anymore. I used to love books and videogames but now all I do is surf through my recommended youtube videos.

"I'm losing everything that was important to me, and I'm a burden to everyone I love.","At the beginning of this year, I was doing well. Full-time job, living on my own in the city, decent social life, and an incredible boyfriend - everything I needed to feel successful.

When the pandemic hit, things didn't change too much. My sister who lived in the same city had me stay with her because she was lonely and it was safer. A few months later I had lost my job and was not receiving unemployment. I was in financial ruin, my sister begrudgingly fed me and consistently hung it over my head that I could not contribute to our new way of life.

When numbers started to drop, I started to spend more time at my boyfriend's place. He really made me feel better about my situation and listened to me cry about how my sister was making me feel - a worthless burden.

Now, I am freelancing within my field, it's not enough to pay for rent so I have no place to live. I have not stayed with my sister in over a month, because of how she treats me when I am around. We used to be best friends and I can feel our relationship fading with each passing day. I try to text her about things that happen in the day or send her memes, but all she responds with is ""cool"". Never has she seemed so disinterested in me. And the only time she really talks to me is to scold me about something.

Never in my life have I felt so worthless.

I'm so thankful that I have my boyfriend, but I can't help but feel like the same cycle of events will eventually unfold. He has told me that I can spend as much time as I need at his place, but I am worried that eventually he will grow cynical towards me. When I stay there I do contribute to expenses and have offered to help with rent. I am just so worried that this boy that I love so unconditionally will turn on me as my sister did. I already lost my sister/best friend and I can't bear to lose him.

I could stay at my parents. However, it is very far away from the city where my boyfriend is. And my dad is extremely emotionally abusive. It put me in a very unhealthy mindset, and I don't think it's fair to make someone live in a house with someone so abusive.

Before the pandemic, I did have a decent social life. But now I feel like I barely have any friends and no one I can really talk to. I am extremely lonely and often insecure about not having any close friends.

I feel so awful. I've had thoughts of suicide on and off throughout the pandemic. But frankly, I know that it would destroy my sister, even though right now it seems like she wants nothing to do with me ever.

I just don't know what to do at this point. But I hate myself, and I hate the situation I am in.

TLDR: After living with my sister for a few months, she now has no interest in being my friend. I have no place to really live, no friends, and I'm afraid my boyfriend will grow to hate me.",hottoiletwater,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhiyui/im_losing_everything_that_was_important_to_me_and/,beginning year wa well full time job living city decent social life incredible boyfriend everything needed feel successful pandemic hit thing change much sister lived city stay wa lonely wa safer month later lost job wa receiving unemployment wa financial ruin sister begrudgingly fed consistently hung head could contribute new way life number started drop started spend time boyfriend place really made feel better situation listened cry sister wa making feel worthless burden freelancing within field enough pay rent place live stayed sister month treat around used best friend feel relationship fading passing day try text thing happen day send meme responds cool never ha seemed disinterested time really talk scold something never life felt worthless thankful boyfriend help feel like cycle event eventually unfold ha told spend much time need place worried eventually grow cynical towards stay contribute expense offered help rent worried boy love unconditionally turn sister already lost sister best friend bear lose could stay parent however far away city boyfriend dad extremely emotionally abusive put unhealthy mindset think fair make someone live house someone abusive pandemic decent social life feel like barely friend one really talk extremely lonely often insecure close friend feel awful thought suicide throughout pandemic frankly know would destroy sister even though right seems like want nothing ever know point hate hate situation tldr living sister month ha interest friend place really live friend afraid boyfriend grow hate,losing everything wa important burden everyone love,hot toilet water,2812,84,hot toilet water beginning year wa well full time job living city decent social life incredible boyfriend everything needed feel successful pandemic hit thing change much sister lived city stay wa lonely wa safer month later lost job wa receiving unemployment wa financial ruin sister begrudgingly fed consistently hung head could contribute new way life number started drop started spend time boyfriend place really made feel better situation listened cry sister wa making feel worthless burden freelancing within field enough pay rent place live stayed sister month treat around used best friend feel relationship fading passing day try text thing happen day send meme responds cool never ha seemed disinterested time really talk scold something never life felt worthless thankful boyfriend help feel like cycle event eventually unfold ha told spend much time need place worried eventually grow cynical towards stay contribute expense offered help rent worried boy love unconditionally turn sister already lost sister best friend bear lose could stay parent however far away city boyfriend dad extremely emotionally abusive put unhealthy mindset think fair make someone live house someone abusive pandemic decent social life feel like barely friend one really talk extremely lonely often insecure close friend feel awful thought suicide throughout pandemic frankly know would destroy sister even though right seems like want nothing ever know point hate hate situation tldr living sister month ha interest friend place really live friend afraid boyfriend grow hate losing everything wa important burden everyone love

"Those of you who overcame severe mental health issues to achieve social, personal and/or professional success... what did you do when it all fell apart?","I've posted a few times (and often deleted) about my turnaround almost six years ago. Long story short, I was unemployed, friendless and increasingly overweight for most of my 20s.

At 28 something changed, I kinda snapped out of it and started a career. From less than $100k earned in my entire life, to a six figure salary in less than five years. From abusive relationships and meaningless friendships to loving partners and supportive friends. From being almost 300lbs back to my high school weight of 185.

That worked for a while. I continued to achieve success, impressing friends and family, getting constantly promoted and given more responsibility at work. I bought a house, my first brand new car, an upper management position at a tech company. All before I turned 34.

But along the way I made some bad decisions. I sabotaged relationships with people who loved me, including a woman I thought I might marry. I started behaving recklessly, spending thousands of dollars a month on alcohol and drugs. Eventually, the stress and my own self hatred became too much. I took a sabbatical from work back in June 2020, even though during the pandemic (and in America) I knew I was very privileged to still have such a high income and benefits including healthcare.

I thought I would focus on my health; mental, physical and financial. I'm not a dumb person, I knew I needed to lose some weight after finding myself 30-40 pounds overweight. I knew I needed to more strictly follow a budget and make long term financial plans. I knew I needed to get back into therapy, which I was doing at the beginning of the year but quit after not getting the help I felt I needed, not seeing the results I wanted.

It has not gone well. I left town for a month, had a great experience travelling the country with my best friend. But when I returned home, I felt so defeated. I reached out to my old boss and the CEO of my former company, but after a week or so realized I wasn't in a position to go back and do my job. I have no friends, even the people I was still close with I've pushed away and deliberately (and unnecessarily harshly) sabotaged my relationships.

I don't **want** to get better anymore. I have to sell some my non tax advantaged investments in order to pay my bills next month (mortgage, car loan, credit cards for ""normal"" monthly spending). I've burned through tens of thousands of dollars, and I acknowledge I'm very privileged to be in even that situation.

I've got a few more months of runway before I would have to start selling retirement investments, but frankly I want to exit more permanently after finalizing my ""post-life"" arrangements so that what I do have can go to those I still care about, even if they don't feel like I do anymore.",breakfastclubsandwch,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhmu3b/those_of_you_who_overcame_severe_mental_health/,posted time often deleted turnaround almost six year ago long story short wa unemployed friendless increasingly overweight 20 28 something changed kinda snapped started career le 100k earned entire life six figure salary le five year abusive relationship meaningless friendship loving partner supportive friend almost 300lbs back high school weight 185 worked continued achieve success impressing friend family getting constantly promoted given responsibility work bought house first brand new car upper management position tech company turned 34 along way made bad decision sabotaged relationship people loved including woman thought might marry started behaving recklessly spending thousand dollar month alcohol drug eventually stress self hatred became much took sabbatical work back june 2020 even though pandemic america knew wa privileged still high income benefit including healthcare thought would focus health mental physical financial dumb person knew needed lose weight finding 30 40 pound overweight knew needed strictly follow budget make long term financial plan knew needed get back therapy wa beginning year quit getting help felt needed seeing result wanted ha gone well left town month great experience travelling country best friend returned home felt defeated reached old bos ceo former company week realized position go back job friend even people wa still close pushed away deliberately unnecessarily harshly sabotaged relationship want get better anymore sell non tax advantaged investment order pay bill next month mortgage car loan credit card normal monthly spending burned ten thousand dollar acknowledge privileged even situation got month runway would start selling retirement investment frankly want exit permanently finalizing post life arrangement go still care even feel like anymore,overcame severe mental health issue achieve social personal professional success fell apart,breakfast club w ch,2764,152,breakfast club w ch posted time often deleted turnaround almost six year ago long story short wa unemployed friendless increasingly overweight 20 28 something changed kinda snapped started career le 100k earned entire life six figure salary le five year abusive relationship meaningless friendship loving partner supportive friend almost 300lbs back high school weight 185 worked continued achieve success impressing friend family getting constantly promoted given responsibility work bought house first brand new car upper management position tech company turned 34 along way made bad decision sabotaged relationship people loved including woman thought might marry started behaving recklessly spending thousand dollar month alcohol drug eventually stress self hatred became much took sabbatical work back june 2020 even though pandemic america knew wa privileged still high income benefit including healthcare thought would focus health mental physical financial dumb person knew needed lose weight finding 30 40 pound overweight knew needed strictly follow budget make long term financial plan knew needed get back therapy wa beginning year quit getting help felt needed seeing result wanted ha gone well left town month great experience travelling country best friend returned home felt defeated reached old bos ceo former company week realized position go back job friend even people wa still close pushed away deliberately unnecessarily harshly sabotaged relationship want get better anymore sell non tax advantaged investment order pay bill next month mortgage car loan credit card normal monthly spending burned ten thousand dollar acknowledge privileged even situation got month runway would start selling retirement investment frankly want exit permanently finalizing post life arrangement go still care even feel like anymore overcame severe mental health issue achieve social personal professional success fell apart

I don’t know,"I’ve been trying years to make gay friends. To make normal friends. Even joined the military to broaden my horizons. I hate my life. I hate this unit. It’s toxic. I get so many problems here both with my unit and trying to reach out to normal people. Nobody wants me as a friend, nobody wants me as a lover, my unit doesn’t even want me as a soldier. I finally worked up the courage to meet more people and they hit it off, but I was just background noise even then. Guys were hitting on them. Women were dancing with them. I was just chopped liver. I keep getting told I’m a beautiful man but nobody approaches me or instigates anything with me, friendship or otherwise. I’m one of the out people in my unit and it feels so ostracizing. I feel so fast out and alone. It feels like I’m never gonna find anybody to relate to, or talk to, or keep safe or help out and vice versa.

I took some mushrooms to try to have a nice relaxed time but my negative mind took over.,"So I took some mushrooms today, alone. I was going to take them and do some art to see if it inspired me in any particular way. 
At the start I was having a nice time, laughing and enjoying myself. That lasted for about 20 minutes. Then the negative part of my brain took over. I felt unsafe and uncomfortable. This is in my own company, in my own house. 
I started writing down my feelings. A lot about how I think I'm a failure to my family as they had high expectations for me and I haven't met any of them. About how my recent break up has impacted me as he was one of very few people whom I actually feel safe around. About how recently I'm starting to feel very put of control of everything in my life. 
Right now I feel like I'm spiraling right back into the same pit I was in years ago, when my eating disorder was at its absolute hight and I really wasn't in control of my thoughts or actions, to an extent. I felt like I was stuck in some sort of living hell, caged inside. I dont want to go back there, but I feel it consuming me.

Isolated,"There are certain gender roles that I feel I do not meet (like being a protector, being a provider, and general self assurance) and this may be a contribution to my low self-esteem 

- It also upsets me when someone tells me to ""just have confidence"" - this feels slightly dismissive and honestly makes me feel like I'm weak. 

   - Even though I have these thoughts 24/7, I always try to be positive and strong. I rarely complain or talk about my problems. Whenever I hear this I get upset because in part I think they're right, but more so, I feel they don't really understand. I was drinking with a friend, we were talking about parties and he was telling me how I need to ""get out of my comfort zone and fuck these girls"". 


 if you have to ask or study it, you'll never have it. I think I'm always people watching, studying others seeing how they live their lives and it's crazy to realize that I live in a different world from these people. We think about different things, we have different goals and different interests.

There are times where I catch myself in my comfort zone but I do push myself at times and sometimes try to make opportunities for myself when I want something (basically, I do try). I try and embrace my invididuality, and these thoughts don't stop me from going after my goals, but I guess looking at others makes me feel as if I don't live in the real world.

Boss rejected my self care leave application,"I have had a difficult month. It started with my boss not recommending me to an internal vacancy.

Please help,"Depressed and anxious

I am new to reddit — I’ve been browsing around for a while now, but I’ve lacked the courage to post anything. I can relate to a lot of what has been posted, and I now feel like it’s time that I share my story:

I grew up in a chaotic household (like I’m sure a lot of you have): my mother was mentally unstable given my father lacked a steady income and was constantly finding and experimenting with entrepreneurial projects that failed to provide our family with any steady source of income. My most vivid memories (when I can actually remember, which is difficult when you have MDD) are my parents fighting constantly about mortgage payments, infidelity on business trips, and lack of extended family support. My parents divorced when I was 12 — I I lived in multiple houses growing up with my mom, and my dad has been in and out of my life ever since, though he’s been more involved these past couple of years (I actually lived on his couch from 25 to 26).

However, fortunately, I was able to push through (or ignore)a lot of these family problems growing up, though I was still considered weird by a lot of people my age. I was an excellent high school student: I graduated with a 4.2 gpa and played two sports in which I was a captain for one them senior year. I went on to an elite private college on the east coast in which I played a varsity sport for 4 years. I had an amazing gf who I loved very much (we were together for 4 years in college, and one year after). I was confident and genuinely believed in myself: I didn’t have a fake belief in myself, but a deep love and care for myself. I graduated with a solid gpa as well as a couple of awards for both sports and academics.

After I graduated, my life spiraled out of control: I became deeply, deeply depressed and started to hate my self, a hatred so deep words cannot describe how I felt. I was stuck at a job that meant nothing to me, and spent my weekends indulging in alcohol and marijuana (my brain doesn’t react well to either of those substances). Each day I started to feel more and more “out of it”, emotionally numb, and dysphoric: I felt nothing, there was nothing to live for, and I stopped enjoying everything that used to bring me meaning and joy. I quit my job after 7 months, and I moved back home, leaving behind everything that I worked hard for: a job, friends that respected me, and a loving gf. 

After moving back, I was EXTREMELY heart broken after leaving my ex: I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t able to be the rock and support system for her anymore, I couldn’t understand why I felt so emotionally numb, and I couldn’t understand why there wasn’t any intimacy or passion in the sex or relationship anymore. I started to question my entire existence and identity, and I fell into the darkest depression a person could fall into: I literally questioned everything — I didn’t know my name, my gender, where I was born, my sexual orientation. Nothing felt real — I couldn’t tell real memories from fake memories. I had no sense of self which was slowly destroying me. 

Fast forward a year - I was living at home, unemployed and miserable. I ended up taking the GRE and applied to a graduate program at an Ivy League school. Got in, did that, but I still hated my self the whole time (depression, dysphoria, anxiety) it was just that I was able to hide it and distract myself in academics.

After getting my grad degree, I moved home, and I failed to keep in contact with everyone I met in school. Again, the cycle continued: depressed, dysphoric, unemployed, anxious, living at home, and lonely. I couldn’t figure out how to hold on to a job or even find one; I just wanted to go back to school again for the third time, take out more loans, and become further in debt. I stopped caring completely, about everything.

I started to watch porn, have sex with random girls to boost my self esteem (it never did) and drink heavily, and I also got into COCAINE, which completely destroyed me: I felt worthless and lost before, oh boy did cocaine just absolutely fuck me up. My delusions and dysphoria started to worsen: my life goal was to become a cocaine dealer in Mexico (started looking at plane tickets) or a lady boy in Thailand. My entire sex drive was in ruins: I had nothing solid to hold onto, again, a very fragile self image around who I was as human being with very intense dysphoria. For example, I would have repeated videos in my brain of being raped over and over again: I genuinely believed I was a victim of childhood rape, but there is no evidence of that. I went on a cocaine and alcohol binge one night, and the only thing I remember is the next morning being driven to the emergency room: I had gotten the shit beat out of me at the bar, been handcuffed  by the cops, driven home by them, and started threatening to kill myself as well as my entire family. At the emergency room, I had an insanely high blood alcohol content as well as cocaine in my system (even the day after). I talked to the social worker/psychologist there, and he determined that I was suicidal and delusional, so he put me in the schizophrenic unit of the psych ward for three days, but after the first day I was moved to the major depression and anxiety unit as they believed that was a better fit. 

I got out after 4 or 5 days, and I went to see a mental health professional voluntarily for the first time since I was a child: I saw a psychologist when I was young, but that was it. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic features, and I was prescribed Abilify and Lexapro. I had been taking both for about a year and a half; however, I went cold turkey on the Lexapro two or three weeks ago and tapered off the Abilify myself a month and a half ago: I just couldn’t stand the weight gain ( I probably gained 50 lbs) and it really didn’t make me feel at peace with myself, it was a bandaid, and I genuinely knew that from the bottom of my heart.

Moved back to the Ivy League town where I graduated from, and I was able to find a job doing consulting work (think about one of those jobs that only rich connected people get); but I quit after 8 months because I wanted to become a professional poker player. I moved to Las Vegas, got an apartment, and started playing at the casinos. Covid happened, I lost my money, and moved back home again. Again, cycle repeats itself. 

I recently found a job in another state doing bullshit office work: think Dilbert or Office Space. But, I have come to terms with it, and I’m doing my best to find joy in the little things. I have completely quit alcohol: it’s not even an option. I’m done with it, forever. Drugs and alcohol absolutely crush me. 

I still have intense bouts of crippling depression and anxiety attacks which I’ve come to realize are fueled by my inability to understand who I am or hold onto any sort of solid self image of myself at the deepest level: this prevents me from seeking out genuine relationships with other people, whether that be friends or a significant other. I am still questioning all aspects of my self: Am I straight or gay? Am I male or female? Where am I from? What is my name? Who are my family members? Memories don’t seem real, nothing seems real anymore. It’s wearing me down, and I can’t imagine that a person could go through so much pain and still exist. It’s a miracle.

I’m seeing a new psychiatrist, and I am hopeful he will help. I’ve been stable before, relatively content and at peace with myself; I am hoping to get back to that place again. I can’t give up.

Thanks for reading.

But somehow I am not bothered by them nearly as much as I am bothered by the fact that I don't have a shoulder to cry on. I am starved for touch, and it's actually turning into physical pain. I know in my head I will never have a girlfriend but my intense desire for one doesn't seem to go away no matter how hard I try.

Everytime I pass by a large tree, I see my legs hanging at eye level, presumably from one of the branches.

Everytime I lay in bed, I see myself sprawled out across my sheets with a gun in my hand.

Everytime I'm in my car, I see a large truck in my rear view mirror, moving at a deadly speed with no intention to stop. 

Everytime someone talks about traffic, I see myself running on the highway in my pajamas, frantically finding a stretch of road to get run over. 

Everytime I try to get fresh air, I see myself running off of a bridge. 

It didn't occur to me until now that I've reverted back into this way. I really believed I was on my way out of the dark. I guess it was time for me to find my place.

I hate both everyone and myself,"Humans are ugly creatures, inundated with flaws. There’s so much pain and suffering in the world, as a direct result of all the actions we’ve undertaken. All we do is *hurt* each other, and it’s something we can’t seem to stop doing. At their core, most people prioritize themselves, and no one cares about anyone else. How many charitable acts are done with an ulterior motive? How many times does someone do something kind to benefit themselves in some way, big or small, consciously or unconsciously? A lot.

I’ve never told anyone this, but there are so many times I’ll feel repulsed by people I interact with. I’ll think so many people are disgusting on an everyday basis, even my closest friends, if you could call them that. I’ll think they’re either being stupid, immature, shortsighted, mean-spirited, inconsiderate, or a slew of other adjectives. And you know what also happens often? I see myself in them. I see myself engaging in the same or worse behavior, I’ll see myself possessing those same undesirable qualities. It’s abhorrible. We’re all so flawed.

Are there good things about people? Absolutely. Many people are genuinely kind and compassionate, and are amazing people. In fact, I think everyone has things that make them awesome, and I generally like to believe I have faith in humanity. But I can’t help but feel this way.

I’ve been trying to think of why I can’t trust people. Maybe this is one reason why. I don’t trust people enough to not fall prey to their own flaws and hurt me. I don’t trust myself to not do the same and to hurt myself. And I really don’t want to feel hurt ever again, no matter what. I don’t even know how someone could earn my trust at this point. If that means being alone so be it.

I still care about everyone, even if they aren’t close to me. I still love everyone. I may not love my closest friends much more than strangers because I fear emotional attachment, but I love strangers more than most people do. And we’re not that bad. I think we’re all just fallen angels, beautiful beings disgraced from heaven. Everyone is so fucking disgusting, but they’re pretty beautiful too, and there are few people I genuinely don’t love.",IMainJannaxxx,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhojfv/i_hate_both_everyone_and_myself/,human ugly creature inundated flaw much pain suffering world direct result action undertaken hurt something seem stop core people prioritize one care anyone else many charitable act done ulterior motive many time doe someone something kind benefit way big small consciously unconsciously lot never told anyone many time feel repulsed people interact think many people disgusting everyday basis even closest friend could call think either stupid immature shortsighted mean spirited inconsiderate slew adjective know also happens often see see engaging worse behavior see possessing undesirable quality abhorrible flawed good thing people absolutely many people genuinely kind compassionate amazing people fact think everyone ha thing make awesome generally like believe faith humanity help feel way trying think trust people maybe one reason trust people enough fall prey flaw hurt trust hurt really want feel hurt ever matter even know someone could earn trust point mean alone still care everyone even close still love everyone may love closest friend much stranger fear emotional attachment love stranger people bad think fallen angel beautiful disgraced heaven everyone fucking disgusting pretty beautiful people genuinely love,hate everyone,main j anna xxx,2184,31,main j anna xxx human ugly creature inundated flaw much pain suffering world direct result action undertaken hurt something seem stop core people prioritize one care anyone else many charitable act done ulterior motive many time doe someone something kind benefit way big small consciously unconsciously lot never told anyone many time feel repulsed people interact think many people disgusting everyday basis even closest friend could call think either stupid immature shortsighted mean spirited inconsiderate slew adjective know also happens often see see engaging worse behavior see possessing undesirable quality abhorrible flawed good thing people absolutely many people genuinely kind compassionate amazing people fact think everyone ha thing make awesome generally like believe faith humanity help feel way trying think trust people maybe one reason trust people enough fall prey flaw hurt trust hurt really want feel hurt ever matter even know someone could earn trust point mean alone still care everyone even close still love everyone may love closest friend much stranger fear emotional attachment love stranger people bad think fallen angel beautiful disgraced heaven everyone fucking disgusting pretty beautiful people genuinely love hate everyone

Crashing after good experiences?,"So I had a good night last night playing D&amp;D. There was a point where I felt like I was firing on all cylinders mentally. Went to bed, got a decent sleep in. When I can be bothered I will write up the story, it's pretty funny if you like D&amp;D stuff

Lyrics to write to when I'm depressed.,"Based on August Alsina's FML. All rights goes to August Alsina.

\[Intro\]

They say ain't easy

They say life's hard.

Everybody's going through this, and I have to suck it up.

\[Verse 1\]

Wake up feelin' like screw my life, life's a challenge, I better work it right

Lost my love in this losin' economy, when I left US, it's like I lost my life

Folks losin' gwap as I'm losin' hope (1)

I took a beating, I lost my mind then I lost my time

Came to Korea with no will of my own, had to fly to survive

Everybody's working over-time, Even US is grinding like Korea

Long hours, Crazy Abuse, Little Pay and Rising price

Admired to you YouTubers, they start complainin', They feel the heat

\[Verse 2\]

Let me tell you 'bout my self, I'm not scared to flee

Been through so much pain, sometimes I wanna run outta here

Wanna know how it feels to have joy, wanna know how it feels have joy

I feel hatred of religion, I don't hate God

\[Hook\]

I never thought that I would be here

I never thought I'd get this far

They say life is like a hellhole

Well why am I burning in the dark?

Sometimes I just feel like hate my life, screw my life

Even when I'm up, I'm feeling down, hate my life

Most of the Koreans grindin' up or dead, hate my life, screw my life (2)

Sometimes I just feel like hate this world, hate this life, hate this universe

\[Verse 3\]

See I grew up in the US, where everybody's broke

A lot of them grown up poorly, they break down to cope

And life ain't easy in the Korea, suicide nation

They might not make it here tomorrow, like they're running outta hope

\[Hook\]

I never thought that I would be here

I never thought I'd get this far

They say life is like a hellhole

Well why am I burning in the dark?

Sometimes I just feel like hate my life, screw my life

Even when I'm up, I'm feeling down, hate my life

Most of the Koreans grindin' up or dead, hate my life, screw my life

Sometimes I just feel like hate this world, hate this life, hate this universe

I've always been an over sleeper ever since adolescence, but seriously, I can sleep 9 hours in the night, then a 2 hour nap 2 hours after waking up, and still feel tired. I did get blood tests done, and the only thing that came wrong was my vitamin D level, which was a little low. Can that really be making me so tired, or is it the medication?

18 first time voting ruined by parents,"tldr: my parents are mad bc i dont want to vote as a family since i dont feel comfortable with their toxic views/behaviours


ive been distancing myself mainly because of my parents being extremely toxic and mad at everything i do especially since i told them im depressed. I've been like this for all my life but recently its been bad enough for when i was 16 i got prescribed meds for it.

anyways my mum made it a big deal to vote as a family, even though i think its unnecessary and quite frankly the climate is making me extremely anxious about everything. i try not to speak my mind on opinions as it may start fighting.

i tend to close myself off especially since voting is very important and i wanted it to be personal and what i wanted to do. yet since i was with the vicinity of my parents and sister i felt obligated to do what was ""the right"" within our family which i didnt agree with *for props and stuff*. they asked me what i picked and i said i dont feel comfortable and they exploded on me.

""thats a stupid reason""

""you just dont want to talk to us""

""you're stupid for thinking that we dont know that you just dont want to be with us""

I’m so proud of myself,"  

I haven’t been diagnosed with depression and anxiety but based on my experience and symptoms I do have. It is 4 years that I feel like this and it is impossible that it is not depression and anxiety. Nobody knows that I feel like this even my friends, family, and my relatives. I only share what I feel in my internet friends because they are strangers and they didn’t know me and my family. Imagine 4 years being like this and you still fighting, I know I do have suicide thoughts and I really want to kill myself but look I’m still alive. I really can’t get professional help because I do have lot of problems to fix, I’m not rich to get a professional help. I just really want to embrace my darkness and escape from reality, I always staying in my room for 24 hours and avoid socializing coz I can’t talk properly and I do have some things that people can’t understand. I know someday I’m going to die and I don’t need to fight anymore, people always ignore me and keep saying that get professional help but they didn’t know why I can’t ( I appreciate their kindness but I really can’t get professional help ) I’m killing myself because of my undiagnosed depression and anxiety. You know the feeling that you want to be alone but you also need help at the same time. Since birth I don’t have real friends/ best friends because of my appearance. Now I’m in the stage of being a burden and a manipulator. I do cryptic messages in my insta stories but I didn’t mean to manipulate coz its my account and I didn’t know someone can see my stories coz I’m not famous, The only purpose of that cryptic messages is to release my unanswered questions in my head, anger, sadness, etc. Because of my existence I feel like its my fault and I don’t know how to stop being me, But I’m still fighting. Sleeping is helpful to avoid depression thoughts but in the night, I can’t sleep and be depressed again. My life was 50 – 50 right now coz I don’t understand what’s happening. I also want to embrace this feeling than to socialize people because I know that humans are the monster in my thoughts. They bullied me, betray me, use me, and destroy my existence. We all know that getting help is not easy and I’m scared being ignored again. But in this smiley face there was a dark side that you don’t want to see coz you might cry or scared. Right now, I’m in my imagination and trying to understand what’s my purpose in this world. Damn, crying everyday is not easy man its just you want to die now. But yeah I’m so proud of myself because I’m fighting and I know that someday I’m gonna give up and die peacefully.

I’m lonely..,"I’m lonely. I’m a 22 Year old man, who at one point, had a girlfriend, a big group of friends, and always got out and met new people. Eventually withoug getting into the details of it, everything fell apart. I have 3 friends approximately. And even that feels like a lie.

The people I am friends and family with all have a girl to love them.

Everytime I meet a girl, I’m either not interested and they are, or I am interested and they lose interest. For the past 2 years, every single girl I’ve found interest in, has lost it in me. No one reaches out to see how I am. No one says happy birthday anymore. Only my family and those 2-3 friends. And that only makes me sad. My family is the only one who cares? I always thought I was a fun and interesting person, and I play it off like that. But I’m starting to see and feel like I’m nothing. I may never be anything.

I say this as once again, on a weekend night as time passes, and I have no plans, I lay on the couch in the dark. 

It only started to dawn upon me heavily once I started to get symptoms of a possible brain tumor. (hopefully its not, but I had blood tests today, and get a ct scan next week to see for sure)

My point is, say it was that, and they say I have/had 5 months to live.. Who gives a fuck. My mom. My brothers..

Who else? someone that wouldn’t forget me at-least for a while? Someone who loved me as a partner. Someone who would miss me as a bestfriend. I slowly have begun to hope its a brain tumor. Why not at this point. 

Every year, summer I manage to work on myself and feel better, but once winter comes, I start to see all the darkness again. All the real issues that never really left but I only hid. 

I just want someone to love me, and care about me like I see others cared for.

Is it normal for a 13 year old to go through 3 depressive episodes their lifetime?,I know people are going to say your probably just say I’m sad but 99% sure it is depression. If your going to say that or something like that just leave. Ok so my backstory for my first depressive episode is that it was caused by my mom abusing me from when I was ages 8-10 and I fell into a severe depressive episode because of that. That episode lasted like 6 months. After that she got better and stopped abusing me. My second depressive episode was when I was 11 and it lasted from September to December. It was a mild depressive episode and I didn’t even know I was depressed until after that episode ended. It wasn’t caused by anything that was happening in my life so I don’t know why that happened. My last depressive episode was a severe depressive episode and started this past July and stopped in the beginning of September. Nothing in my life caused that either so if anyone out there could tell me what is wrong with me I would really appreciate it.,user876492077,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhktne/is_it_normal_for_a_13_year_old_to_go_through_3/,know people going say probably say sad 99 sure depression going say something like leave ok backstory first depressive episode wa caused mom abusing wa age 8 10 fell severe depressive episode episode lasted like 6 month got better stopped abusing second depressive episode wa wa 11 lasted september december wa mild depressive episode even know wa depressed episode ended caused anything wa happening life know happened last depressive episode wa severe depressive episode started past july stopped beginning september nothing life caused either anyone could tell wrong would really appreciate,normal 13 year old go 3 depressive episode lifetime,user 876492077,962,82,user 876492077 know people going say probably say sad 99 sure depression going say something like leave ok backstory first depressive episode wa caused mom abusing wa age 8 10 fell severe depressive episode episode lasted like 6 month got better stopped abusing second depressive episode wa wa 11 lasted september december wa mild depressive episode even know wa depressed episode ended caused anything wa happening life know happened last depressive episode wa severe depressive episode started past july stopped beginning september nothing life caused either anyone could tell wrong would really appreciate normal 13 year old go 3 depressive episode lifetime

"Have you ever ended a relationship, truly because of depression/anxiety and stress?","Do you believe what they say?

He [31M] broke up with me [28F] saying it had nothing to do with us. There was nothing I could have done or should have done differently. He still wants to be with me. We had a great relationship. Perfect? No. But it was...... amazing.

He says his anxiety, work and his brother's recent decline into suicidal thoughts has him spread too thin to even think about a relationship or being with someone. He said he didn't want it to be permanent but he also didn't want me holding on and waiting in case he couldn't get back to a good place emotionally. He cried throughout this conversation.

He said he wasn't happy, he could barely look in a mirror and he was not okay. 

My heart hurts, because he's hurting. But my heart also hurts that it's just over, when he was.... Incredible. 


I've tried to stay in touch every other day or so, we talk about TV shows mostly. But then he just disappears and I don't hear from him. 


When I took back his house key, we talked, we cried, we laughed, he told me he loved spending time together but that it really was just too much because I deserved the best and he was not capable of giving me that right now. That he can’t be who he wants in a relationship, with where he’s at right now.

He kissed me and even ended up sleeping together and spending the night, it was the same as it'd always been. But then the next morning, he walked me to my car and it was over- Just like that. Everything was still the same, it was still over. He thanked me for coming over, so he could talk about things that had him torn up.

This was about 3 weeks ago and it’s been a nightmare for me. I literally have felt like I’m on autopilot. My dad was diagnosed with cancer when we first started dating and in the last 3 weeks, was told we had 12 months with him.

My immediate instinct is to tell my ex, which isn’t fair. Then my daughter asks about him all the time, which I still don’t have the wherewithal to tell her what’s going on either. It’s all just....

Where is my motivation???,"I’m really not sure where to post this, if there are any other subs that might be better please let me know. 

I’ve dealt with depression/anxiety my whole life, finding energy to do things feels impossible most the time. I make art and it’s my dream job, it’s fulfilling and spiritual for me and I wouldn’t want to do anything else. Unfortunately, I find that even when I have projects or ideas, I just can’t seem to find the energy inside me to act upon it. It’s like fighting with myself. It has to do with a lot of things that I won’t go too into detail, but I guess mostly I fear disappointing myself, so I avoid it sometimes. Other times it feels like I simply ran out of battery power to even do anything I want. 

But what is really weird to me that I don’t understand, is that when I’m at my job (current and past jobs) I work as hard as I can, I do amazing at time efficiency, multitasking, have high focus etc. I try to think about how other coworkers could use extra help, what could I do to make their shift easier? It’s like I go overboard working as hard as I can. Of course I mess up every now and then but I guess my point is, the work ethic I exhibit at my jobs is exactly the work ethic I want to have for myself and my art. It’s like I won’t allow it for myself?

I guess I’m curious if anyone understands. It makes me feel like I’m wasting my energy at my job, but I don’t think that’s necessarily it bc I was unemployed for a few months and I felt the same way. When I notice this pattern it makes me feel so lazy and worthless of myself and it’s heartbreaking to feel like I don’t want to make art. I’ve tried supplements for energy and they only do so much for me. It’s like something is stuck inside me that I can’t and don’t know how to fix. I journal daily and try to really look within myself to work these issues out, which has helped a lot, but again it feels like something is just not clicking. It’s mentally exhausting and I’m just not sure how to help myself with this anymore.",islandwalking,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhkii0/where_is_my_motivation/,really sure post sub might better please let know dealt depression anxiety whole life finding energy thing feel impossible time make art dream job fulfilling spiritual want anything else unfortunately find even project idea seem find energy inside act upon like fighting ha lot thing go detail guess mostly fear disappointing avoid sometimes time feel like simply ran battery power even anything want really weird understand job current past job work hard amazing time efficiency multitasking high focus etc try think coworkers could use extra help could make shift easier like go overboard working hard course mess every guess point work ethic exhibit job exactly work ethic want art like allow guess curious anyone understands make feel like wasting energy job think necessarily bc wa unemployed month felt way notice pattern make feel lazy worthless heartbreaking feel like want make art tried supplement energy much like something stuck inside know fix journal daily try really look within work issue ha helped lot feel like something clicking mentally exhausting sure help anymore,motivation,island walking,2010,25,island walking really sure post sub might better please let know dealt depression anxiety whole life finding energy thing feel impossible time make art dream job fulfilling spiritual want anything else unfortunately find even project idea seem find energy inside act upon like fighting ha lot thing go detail guess mostly fear disappointing avoid sometimes time feel like simply ran battery power even anything want really weird understand job current past job work hard amazing time efficiency multitasking high focus etc try think coworkers could use extra help could make shift easier like go overboard working hard course mess every guess point work ethic exhibit job exactly work ethic want art like allow guess curious anyone understands make feel like wasting energy job think necessarily bc wa unemployed month felt way notice pattern make feel lazy worthless heartbreaking feel like want make art tried supplement energy much like something stuck inside know fix journal daily try really look within work issue ha helped lot feel like something clicking mentally exhausting sure help anymore motivation
It got worsen,"I just don't feel well. I don't know how to calm myself. This constant pressure eating me alive. Amount of suicidal thoughts i had these... like 3 days? I don't know, I lost count of days. I can't even differentiate them. Amount of suicidal thoughts i had these couple days is probably more than those 6 months combined. And it's no longer fantasies about not waking up or not existing at all. It's very detailed imaginations of slitting my wrist.
I'm not even thinking about it nor want to attempt it. It just pops out of nowhere and terrorises me. I don't know why my brain does this to me. I don't want to do it. Existing feels extremely painful at this moment. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it.
It's so painful it made me rewatch my life and everything that happened in this 6 months. I accepted why I'm depressed, and reason makes me more depressed. And on top of that like it's not fucking enough, today i got to know about this ""reason"" more which made me die inside. And on top on top of that (great!) While typing this i noticed that I'm not really interesting person. I was hanging out today with friends for whole day. Noone talked to me. Noone was interested in chat with me. And they know that I'm not feeling ok at all. I had ""episodes"" of selfharming or crying out of nowhere infront of them.

Looking to change my life but Im afraid and dont have the motivation. (Question) (Discussion),"This year I realized how far behind I am on the goals that made for myself about 4 or 5 years ago. I dont have my own place, I dont have a college degree, I dont have a job or any experience and Im afraid of looking for one, and Im just learning how to drive. I want to accomplish goals like doing those things that I havent done yet and more but sometimes Im motivated to work on them and other times I dont have any motivation at all because I either lost it or just didnt have any that day to begin working on what I needed to work on. There are times when thinking about how far behind I am will make me stressed, upset, and not want to eat anything at all and it keeps me from being motivated. When it comes to jobs the thought of getting certain ones like Target scare me. Im afraid of people laughing at me or going ""Huh well this guy made bad choices in his life"" or something like that but I know that my choices as to where I can work are limited because I dont have a college degree and I lack job experience. Im also afraid of not being able to make friends with people around my own age when I find a place to work at. I try to stay hopeful and optimistic and it keeps me motivated for a while until I lose the motivation and hope for myself because I realized that I still havent achieved anything. I feel like this is my punishment for being too scared and hesitating to do what I shouldve done years ago and now Im paying for it now and it will be nearly impossible to achieve those goals I have before Im 30 or at all.

I had it all,"I don't know how to start this, I'm a 23 year old man and I couldn't feel more of a child than my entire life. It all started about 6 months ago when me and my girlfriend broke up. It's hard to put into words and truly recreate what happened during our relationship so this post is going to be a very long one

Some history of my relationships with my family and friends: I've been an integral and active part in my family since i was 14 years old. My family is amazing but this past year, especially after the breakup, I feel everything changing and i'm not sure if it's them or me. I've done so much and have had to make such hard decisions even at a young age regarding my family and dealing with them in such a way that leaves whichever mistake/situation at hand simply as that, a bad mistake/decision and showing love to my family, only ever wanting to help and fix the situation. My will-power for my entire life has been asburd, literally nothing would ever stand in my way, not forcefully either, but I always knew I was capable of achieving such great things if I put the work and effort toward them. My father is incredibly strong, but very critical. We've always had a good relationship, and my father's side of the family are so strong and secure, we never let any problem get to us, we'd always solve it or prevent it if possible. My mother's side is extremely caring, and I've had an amazing relationship with both of my grandmother's, especially on my mother's side. We'd talk all the time and go over problems, and we'd always help figure them out together. My mother re-married when i was 15 to her childhood friend after my parent's got divorced and although my step-father has seemingly been doing better, there was a lot of shit he put not only me but my mother and little brothers through, and he knows that I'll always be there to protect them. Except that's the problem, with how i've been feeling lately it seems impossible to be there for my family, let alone myself. And as much as I want to talk about it, It feels impossible since I've always been the one to answer the hard questions, to help guide myself, my friends, and my family towards the right path. If i talk to them now about how hard these past few months then am i not just a hypocrite for not taking my own advice and moving forward? I've never belittled anybody for their issues but I've always focused on ways to solve them and I cannot solve this feeling inside of me.

 When i got into my last relationship 2 years ago, i let every guard down with my girlfriend. I've been with women and have had short relationships, but this one was serious and I put everything into it. My ex-gf was incredibly intelligent and hard-working but very anxious and pretty introverted. I've always been a mix intro-extrovert, I enjoy my alone time but I've always been extremely close with my friends and love going out. Since this break-up though I have felt so depressed it is unreal. I've never felt anything like this in my life. I've excelled and am such a smart individual.But this last relationship had destroyed me. We met 1 month before school ended 2 years ago and started seeing each other. She lived 1.5 hours away from our university so she would go home when summer started. I started to feel pretty connected to this girl and she certainly cared about me. After a lot of hard thinking we decided to continue dating throughout summer and try to make things work, That summer I worked 8-5 in a family friend's detailing garage as a summer job, went to the gym each day after work, and every friday after work I'd make the hour and a half drive down to see this girl and be with her family,she would drive down as well, we kept it pretty even but i definitely did more driving which was alright by me, she was working a lot of hours and had to drive a lot so i didn't mind making a few extra trips. on some occasions I'd even stay sunday night if she wasn't feeling well or was anxious/wanting to talk and leave her house at 5:30am on Monday to make it to work, and I had no issues doing that since i knew how much it meant to her. I really started to fall for this girl. After our 2nd month in summer before we decided to make things serious we were talking on the phone and she asked me about being serious with our relationship and having our family's meet, we had agreed we would not see anybody else and we were still enjoying each other and figuring out how well we got together. And that night I told her I'd think about it and let her know tommorrow, it was a big decision and I was leaning towards yes but I understood the amount of love and commitment that goes into a healthy relationship and I wanted to make sure I was signing up for that and able to be that for her. When I woke up I was in pure bliss, I knew how much this girl loved me and I loved her too, and I admitted that to myself and I wanted to be with her. Her first text that morning was her saying sorry about what happened. After I asked, she told me that she had gone to her friend's house and they had done some things( not all the way) but damn well more than enough of what is even remotely ok. I was so caught off. I couldn't believe it, It had been not but 2 hours since she was professing her love for me that night, and me wanting to make sure I made the right decision she took it as I was breaking up with her and immediately flocked to get her condolence from a weird ass guy. I couldn't believe it. With any other person in my life I would've been done, without a question. It tore me apart. Her birthday was coming up that weekend and I had gotten her a gift bag with roses and a candle and a lot of her favorite lotions she'd always talk about and I was so happy to give it to her. I told her I needed some time and she began crying hysterically. I didn't talk to her much but decided to come down for her birthday. I hadn't decided whether it was going to be to break-up with her or to see what happened, there were multiple times during the drive I just thought fuck it I'll turn around she messed up and she knows exactly what she did, but for some reason I t was like a posession to keep driving down. When i got there we went downstairs and she was crying, begging me on her knees that I would stay, she had written a 2 page letter to me saying how much I'd done for her and how she wanted to die after what happened. I couldn't believe it, it was the hardest decision in my life, but I thought she meant what she said and I decided to give her another chance. I'm not a controlling person but as you'd imagine I lost all trust in her, she had a few guy friends in her nursing class that I met and were good guys that I trusted but a few i hadn't met. And i told her, I do not feel comfortable anymore with you talking to these guy-friends I haven't met. I felt like shit saying it, i know what it looks like and I know what it is. No person should have to limit their partner, or anyone on who they can keep in contact with. But I was so done at that point that was the only way I would stay, and if i got to meet them and see how they were that'd be a different story. I felt like complete shit even saying that but it was the only way I could trust her. I hadn't even heard of the guy that she went over to his house. But she agreed, and we worked things out together for the most part. We dated throughout summer and slowly the trust started to come back and I was still madly in love with this girl which is why it was so hard. At 21 we practically moved in together when school started. We'd stay at my mom's house for a week together, pack our things, and then go stay in her dorm together for a week. We went grocery shopping and did everything together. She didn't have many friends, and the ones she had were from her hometown besides her few nursing friends, and if I'm being honest they put her on the back-burner quite a bit and flopped out of plans to hang out pretty often although it meant a lot to her. And i felt bad about that. I was always there for her, and I told her it was their loss. I remember one day in bed her just staring at me with the most awe-filled and adoring eyes looking at me saying how i was her best friend and how much she loved me, and I said ofcourse sweetheart I love you too, it was just a fact. I cared deeply about this girl and I wanted the best for her and for her to succeed in anything she tried. A few months later, everything is going amazing and during our christmas break we were visiting her family's house for a week and she came to me saying her ex had messaged her on facebook. ""ok?"" I said, did he want or say anything. And she then went on to justify how she'd known him for so long and were still friends with him. News to me, I could see the painting on the wall already, and I fucking knew it and it tore me apart. How do you react to something like this knowing what happened before? If I say no immediately am i too controlling? If i pass it off am i a fool? I told her how uncomfortable it made me and if she just wanted to talk to him and catch up and that's all it was then that's fine by me. The worst part is that she acted so dumbfounded about why i might be hesitant of her talking with her ex, let alone after everything that happened in summer and how hard that was. Now it was just gone in her mind, ""never happpened, what's the matter?"" It blew my mind. But I said what I said and that was it, she promised it was just to catch up. Ofcourse over the next few weeks i notice she's on her phone a lot more than usual when we're in bed together watching TV, and I ask her whatsup? And she replies, oh I'm just texting ""name"", why what's the matter? And made me feel completely obsolete, there was no, oh he just texted me and I was responding or anything like that, she had been talking to this guy for 20 minutes straight each the night this week and on the 4th or 5th night I asked her whatsup and that's what she said, as if it was her mom. Keep in mind we both had busy schedules so we hardly had more than 3-4 hours to spend with each other each night. She was still loving and showing a lot of affection to me, she always needed a lot of attention more than anyone I've ever given in my life, friends or family combined and for the most part I was more than alright giving it to her, we had a blast, goofed off and had fun together. Eventually we got into a bit of an argument ( we hardly ever argued and the only serious one was during the first incident) about this guy and she said she wanted to meet him at starbucks, I was not ok with that. At first this ex was simply to talk to and catch up with, that was all, he was a loser and she didn't want anything to do with him. Now she wants to meet up and have coffee, pretty big change there? I said no, i feel uncomfortable with you doing that, when an ex messages me I don't respond or if it's asking a question I answer then that's that. It's not hard to see when other people try to get back into your life. But ofcourse, I feel like an asshole telling her she can't do something so i let her know, I feel uncomfortable but if you want to go, go. And if she did anything or I expected anything it was over. Ofcourse she calls me 25 minutes later saying how much of an asshole this guy was, and I'm like hmm it's not like you've been saying that this entire time yet you still want to go out of your way to keep talking to him? And she apologized said she was sorry, she was done with talking to him and it was over. I felt extremely relieved. about 5 months later we started talking about moving out together and I told her I would love to but our financial situations were very different. We were both 22 at the time, I was going to college full time and working during the summer and she had nursing class and her clinicals. She was blessed enough to have her parent's buy her car, pay for her schooling, and give her a $900/month allowance during school for rent and groceries. She did work very hard at school and put a lot of hours into nursing school with straight A's so she wasn't mooching at all. However, her parents were a lot older than mine and my family helped out as they could and I didn't expect them to do any of those things. I had paid for my first 3 years of school out of pocket, bought my own car, and saved money. Understanding the bills for rent, food, and utilities I told her that it wasn't going to be possible. And i wouldn't feel right just living off of her father's money, also I wasn't sure we were ready to move out together yet. She still had a lot of issues with depression and anxiety, and I wasn't sure if moving out was the right call. I helped her as much as i could and whenever her mood changed or I noticed she was feeling down I was right there to cheer her up, and most of the time it did work. When she needed space I gave it to her, I just always wanted to make sure she knew she was loved and I'd be there for her. Ironically, Miraculously, my genious brother who was 11 at the time brought up that my family's house that my great-grandmother had and we'd been too since kids was vacant since my great-grandma had been in the nursing home for a few years. The house was paid off and the bills would only be the mortgage, utilities, and cable which was more than affordable working a part time-job while going to school if we split the cost. So 1 month later we decided we would move into my family's house together. I can't explain how excited I was to move in with her. It was my great grandma and grandpa's house and there were so many memories in that house, and now we got to move into it together and start our life. I told her I'd take care of all of our stuff that needed to be move so me and my 2 good friends moved my bed, our dressers, and got the house all ready since she was at her nursing clinicals a few hours away, I was so happy to get everything ready for her when she came home and the first thing I said was, sweetheart this is our home.  My grandmother who I've always been close to decided to come over and help clean (she was 67 years old), she was such a sweetheart and wanted to help get us ready in our house. I told her she could do the bathroom mirror since it was the least bending and she wasn't leaving without helping at least a bit lol. She decided to clean the tub too and after she left it was the first moments we had together in our house. I noticed my ex had started to get a bit of an attitude/withdrawn about halfway through my grandma being there so i brought it up and asked her what was wrong and she kind of looked down and said everything was fine, I Thought she might just be anxious since we did put a lot of work into this house over the summer when we weren't working or at school, and it was a big step. Shortly after she left I asked if everything was alright, and she told me she was angry with my grandma, had refused to talk to her because my grandmother decided to clean the bathtub with the wrong bleach. Keep in mind, at no point did she ask my grandma, hey it's ok you don't need to clean the bathtub, or hey can you use a bleach, or ask me to tell my grandma, hey you don't have to clean the bathtub. And so she was upset with her and me, not voicing her opinion on why she was upset until after my grandmother left and I was pretty angry with her. My grandma has done a lot for myself and my family, as well as for my ex. She understood how much my grandmother meant to me and everything we've done for each other, and they were on very good terms there was never a bad word or argument, or bad feelings between any of them, it's extremely hard to dislike my grandmother. I told her that was pretty childish that she didn't at least ask me to tell her to stop, but rather got a mood and decided to sweep the garage for 2 hours while my grandma was there, the entire thing could've been avoided if she just told me what was wrong with her. She was very bad at communicating so I had to do the vast majority of communication during our relationship, and when we did everything was great but she would routinely get into moods like this where she wouldn't talk, did her own thing, and all I was left to do was wonder why she was upset and I couldn't do anything about it. Eventually, the ex she talked to kept getting brought up in sequence, 3 months would go by and she'd bring him up and act as if it was her best-friend and think, ""oh why are you wondering why i'm talking to him"" and living with just her and I, it felt like i was going crazy. I'd never been pushed to my limits so much with a person in my entire life, and the worse part was that she refused to see it from my point of view, or even acknowledge why her behaviour was a little bit out of the ordinary. After the 4th time I decided to break up with her, her lack of empathy and always acting so dumbfounded as to why I would be upset or question why even talk to this guy after every time she would bring him up, I'd allow it, she would come to me saying he's an asshole, I'd tell her, ""yeah the guy seems pretty weird and doesn't do anything good for your life, why even attempt to rekindle this relationship."" I was fed up with it and yet I still tried to work things out with her, but now she had ""Had enough"" of me letting her know how unhealthy and unnecessary what she was doing was for herself and for our relationship. The next day it was like a completely different person, I have never seen anything like it In my life. Even the day before the argument she'd pull me from the computer to snuggle. Every night I'd lay down with her at 9:30 to help her get to sleep, every single night for the entirety of our time dating. I enjoyed it, spending time with her and knowing she could sleep easy, that was enough of a reason for me. But the day after we broke up, she didn't look at me or acknowledge anything. With quarantine being enacted, I let her stay in the house for a month since she wouldn't be able to find a place during the lockdown and she'd have to drive home an hour and a half during her clinicals. I should've kicked her out. She didn't deserve to stay after what she'd done and the conversations she'd had behind my back with this guy. She begged me to read the messages and for the first 4 months I wouldn't why should i have to act like her father, and read the messages she's sending another person. After the 4th month I did, and there was no evidence of treating but they were talking on subject you should not talk about with an ex of your's at all, let alone when that person is in a fucking relationship. This guy was a complete loser, and she fed right into his attention just to receive more of it and it was disgusting. That last month was the hardest month of my life. Waking up with the person I thought i was going to marry sleeping in the room next to me. In the house I had my family pull many strings on just to get us in here. To have her look at me like a stranger and be completely void of feeling when one night before she was her goofy self, wanting to be held and I Loved her. That month was so extremely hard and it's sat with me through the last 6 months and has taken away so much of my energy and will-power. I haven't gone to the gym, I make excuses to not hang out with my friends who I've known since i was 4 years old and are like brothers to me. It's so hard to talk with anyone about this because I've always had my life together to be able to help the ones I care about, and now I can't and so much rides on me being strong for those around me.

All in all, it's great to get this off my chest about this whole situation. There's a lot of good parts I simply can't write all down, and although only the bad parts were here I do believe we loved each other very much, and that she loved me very much. I should've ended things much sooner than I did, but it was hard. We were practically a married couple and 95% of the time had such a good relationship but one of these events would pop up and throw me completely off. I've thought about my relationship constantly these past 6 months figuring out what needed to change to make things work. I still don't have an answer and it destroys me, certain nights i can't sleep. I still have dreams of when she would sleep next to me, and my house just feels empty without her. It's getting better, I have an amazing family but it's been extraordinarily hard to talk to people about what really happened in our relationship.",Wickholder97,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhngce/i_had_it_all/,know start 23 year old man feel child entire life started 6 month ago girlfriend broke hard put word

Thoughts on anti-depressants:,"I know I know I crazy topic. I’m curious on what other peoples thought is about anti- depressants. I’ve struggled with depression since I was young and finally got therapy she finally told me, “How would you feel to be on anti depressants, or at least try?” This has been on my mind for a long time and I’m just wondering if any of you have ever been on them or currently are on them now.

How did it go?

I'll talk to those closest to me about I feel and I get this pit in my gut that I'm doing it all for attention and that really I'm just a manipulative narcissist.

Help," **I am a recent graduate with a bachelor’s in political science, an integrated major in Environment, sustainability, and Policy, and a minor in psychology. I know I have to continue on to a master’s degree to really be able to do anything, so why can’t I get myself to do the work required to take the GRE? College wasn’t easy for me, it turned me into an anxious mess with a generalized anxiety disorder and generalized depression disorder, none of which I had before college. I don’t have any friends, not one, due to those things and everything feels like a chore, and not even taking 150mg of venlafaxine helps. I don’t know what to do, I know I have to take the GRE but not even the possibility of not doing well motivates me to study. But I haven’t had any motivation in the last four years so.

Emotional numbness – am I actually depressed?,"Hi, all. 

I've been struggling with emotional numbness for as long as I can remember. My father walked away when I was 6 and my mother was emotionally unavailable, giving me Ritalin and sleep meds to curb whatever issues I had when I was younger rather than taking care of me. This led to issues during key development stages during adolescence and what I reckon is I learned to suppress emotions rather than feel them in order to minimize suffering.

I've already tried a few regimens for depression and anxiety, which was what all doctors went for. I've tried a few SSRIs already for months at a time, but never felt they made any difference in helping me feel... I don't know, a litte bit more alive.

I have also tried talk therapy on and off with different therapists and approaches and unfortunately found no solace in it. I could go on and on about my life but never come into contact with my issues at the more visceral level needed for healing.

I really want to to *feel* things. I miss crying and I miss actually taking pleasure in activities.

 Could any other sort of therapy or medication be the way to go?",strong_tomato27,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhnb20/emotional_numbness_am_i_actually_depressed/,hi struggling emotional numbness long remember father walked away wa 6 mother wa emotionally unavailable giving ritalin sleep med curb whatever issue wa younger rather taking care led issue key development stage adolescence reckon learned suppress emotion rather feel order minimize suffering already tried regimen depression anxiety wa doctor went tried ssri already month time never felt made difference helping feel know litte bit alive also tried talk therapy different therapist approach unfortunately found solace could go life never come contact issue visceral level needed healing really want feel thing miss cry miss actually taking pleasure activity could sort therapy medication way go,emotional numbness actually depressed,strong tomato 27,1121,45,strong tomato 27 hi struggling emotional numbness long remember father walked away wa 6 mother wa emotionally unavailable giving ritalin sleep med curb whatever issue wa younger rather taking care led issue key development stage adolescence reckon learned suppress emotion rather feel order minimize suffering already tried regimen depression anxiety wa doctor went tried ssri already month time never felt made difference helping feel know litte bit alive also tried talk therapy different therapist approach unfortunately found solace could go life never come contact issue visceral level needed healing really want feel thing miss cry miss actually taking pleasure activity could sort therapy medication way go emotional numbness actually depressed
Friday was dark,"Friday was a scary day. Ive been under a lot of pressure from work. Its a culmination of over 4 years of pressure and emotional second hand trauma. Boss has been on top of me. Ive been on top of me and Ive had no support at home from family or friends. On the way home I knew that even though I tried that day and was able to turn in two files that I was going to get spoken to come monday . The drive home was too long, thoughts became darker and darker. It went from I just want to go home and hug my dog, to thoughts of harming him. Thoughts of being fired, thoughts of never making it anywhere and being stuck at this job. Not making enough money to where i wont be able to give presents come christmas for the 4th year in a row. Living paycheck to pay check. It all became too much and the thoughts of planning out a way to end it became stronger and stronger. Ive never had thoughts like this. I never knew it could get this bad. I thought about checking myself in and calling my mom over to care for my dog, that bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took the dog out and needed to make him and myself public. It was when I was outside thing climaxed then receded. I went to the webpage for the suicide hotline and that helped me out a lot. I feel better today. Im keeping myself busy, trying not to be alone for too long. I need to see a doctor but dont know where to begin. Ive never experienced these emotions before and feel very guilty for thinking violence on my dog who is my only support. I hugged him a lot yesterday and he helped calm me down. I hugged him a lot today and he helped calm me down. I feel lose since yesterday, i cant explain it. I think about what happened and i feel lose, but i cant ""go"" there, not like yesterday. Im not sick but im not well. I need to get some help. Today was better. I left the house a lot. I went to pick up groceries. I watched a movie and took a long nap. I feel better.

I feel like it's getting worse,"For the last 4 years I've struggled with anxiety and I've been able to manage it pretty well. On and off since 2018 I've had depressive thoughts, but they didn't really phase me. About a year ago I moved to a new city (my gf at the time was here, along with a few friends and my sister). I was feeling depressed around the beginning of 2020 and have noticed it progressively getting worse. I really don't know how to phrase it all so I'm just going to make tabs about what I notice about myself 

- I constantly find myself not keeping my things clean. I used to be real bad at this, but I was doing really well until about 2 mo ago. Now I don't care and it stresses me out seeing how dirty my house is, but I'm too tired/unmotivated to do anything about it
- My job/work environment has not been good the last 4-5 mo. I used to love my job, but once coworkers got shuffled around it all changed. I had a new manager that was horrible (and was recently let go) that made my job 10x harder with more work. Our parent company does not keep our business afloat financially and essentially wants us to fix problems/maintain good customer service without paying to fix things. Recently they've claimed they're going to start, but I haven't seen it. 
- Maryjane has gone from here and there a couple times a week to almost daily sometimes more than once a day. I feel like I think about everything and everyone all the time and it slows my brain down
- I don't have many friends in the city and I feel like Im bothering them when I ask to hang out more than here or there. We all have lives and aside for my sister these are all people I've really only spent on and off hanging out with for a year. I've never felt like I've bugged people before and am afraid I will. I have many friends in other cities, the most being my hometown and it makes me wonder if I should move back. 
- I'm trying to figure out where I'm at in life. I have friends getting engaged and I ended a serious relationship. I would love to be married with a kid on the way in 3-6 years, which is a large window, but it's hard to envision. I mean heck I'll even pay psychics $2-$5 for questions about it. I always get different answers, but I guess I was looking for something

Scared to stop feeling numb/depressed,"Ii've been feeling like this for what feels like forever, from around the age of 11/12 and now i'm close to 20. Mostly due to abusive parents. Before fully becoming numb to the point where i can't for the life of me cry or feel anything i remeber being in so much distress and pain constantly and i'm afraid it'll all come back in one form of another if i begin to feel again.
Right now it's all mostly numb, except for some echoes of depression and anxiety that squeeze hard at something in me. I usually just put on a front to not worry anyone or get questions, but i do feel guilty for not feeling truly happy for my friends and in situations where i should be. 
I've gone into therapy recently and as soon as i started to delve more into my mind and my history i can feel it getting bad. It makes me want to retreat back into my usual habbit of ignoring all my issues but i know i have to tackle this or i'll continue feeling like a fraud to my friends. 

If anyone has healed from this, does it get worse before it gets better? I don't know really if it will get any better in a short ammount of time as i have been dealing with these issues for around 10 years now. I have no clue how it is without them really.",arlade,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhn6v9/scared_to_stop_feeling_numbdepressed/,ii feeling like feel like forever around age 11 12 close 20 mostly due abusive parent fully becoming numb point life cry feel anything remeber much distress pain constantly afraid come back one form another begin feel right mostly numb except echo depression anxiety squeeze hard something usually put front worry anyone get question feel guilty feeling truly happy friend situation gone therapy recently soon started delve mind history feel getting bad make want retreat back usual habbit ignoring issue know tackle continue feeling like fraud friend anyone ha healed doe get worse get better know really get better short ammount time dealing issue around 10 year clue without really,scared stop feeling numb depressed,rla de,1217,37,rla de ii feeling like feel like forever around age 11 12 close 20 mostly due abusive parent fully becoming numb point life cry feel anything remeber much distress pain constantly afraid come back one form another begin feel right mostly numb except echo depression anxiety squeeze hard something usually put front worry anyone get question feel guilty feeling truly happy friend situation gone therapy recently soon started delve mind history feel getting bad make want retreat back usual habbit ignoring issue know tackle continue feeling like fraud friend anyone ha healed doe get worse get better know really get better short ammount time dealing issue around 10 year clue without really scared stop feeling numb depressed

Drunken thoughts.,In a sense I feel like books have ruined my expectations on life. I have been reading on Wattpad since I was 15 years old. Now at 27 years old nothing has changed.

Advice for New Social Anxiety/Depression Symptoms,"I used to be pretty generally extroverted and could enjoy (or feign enjoyment of) parties/drinking. But since covid started, social gatherings larger than 5 cause intense anxiety and send me spiraling into depression. My new partner (dating 4 weeks) likes having 10-person parties with her housemates on the weekends and I haven't been able to get through one of them without going home---sometimes self-harming after I leave.

With our relationship so young, I still want to seem fun and go to these parties, but now I can't seem to do it. I'm having difficulty explaining this to my partner and navigating how we can enjoy each other's company in a group setting.

Does anyone have advice on how to manage this social anxiety? I've never had to deal with it before and don't have any tools to work with.

Finally trying.,"I've been chronically depressed since I was 12. I'm 28 now. Every day is 24 hours of me wishing I was dead and trying to will up the courage to do it. 

I finally moved to a place I've always wanted to and have a good job, live alone in a nice place, and I'm completely stable and fine..and I feel nothing.

This led me to start seeing a therapist and then my depression just spiraled out of control in just a few months. 

This week in checking into a full time inpatient program at the mental health clinic near me. 

Will it help? I have no idea.

What happens after you leave the hospital?,"Just spent three weeks in hospital following my suicide attempt. The doctors and nurses were all very kind. My boss came to visit me and assured me my job is still there, but I need more rest before I work. Some friends travelled cities just to see me (there's no lockdown in Taiwan). I've taken so many kinds of medicine; some worked, some didn't and some had very strong side effects. I've met people I hope to consider friends for life, and others I hope to never see again. My Mandarin has vastly improved by communicating with the staff and other patients. Overall, some days were good, some days were bad, the bill isn't as bad as I feared and I'm just anxious as to what happens next.

I just want a peaceful death.,"I hate that it's considered irrational for someone who has battled mental health issues as long as I have to want to stop suffering and peacefully end my life. I'm so impossibly tired. The death with dignity act in my state would be so perfect for where I am now if it was expanded to include those battling lifelong mental illness. I understand why people are wary about the ways in which such a thing involving an already vulnerable group could be exploited. I hate how demented and entitled I come across as for wanting to burden others with something as heavy as helping me end my own life.

Somehow, it just feels really important to me to be able to transition peacefully. I hate the idea of being 'found'. Trauma and mental illness have stripped me of so much dignity in life. I just wish that, at the very least, I could have a death that acknowledges my humanity in a way the majority of what I've been subjected to in life has not. I'm agnostic and generally have no clue what to make of the whys and hows of how we all ended up here. I only know that I'm terrified of ending up just as tortured in the afterlife as I am here and now. I just want peace and rest.

I've obviously been streaming way too many episodes of The Ghost Whisperer. =P

Or maybe I'm just a coward?

I  don't know. I just needed to vent. I wish I could talk candidly about this with professionals without dishonesty, gaslighting, and the threat of hospitalization coming into play. I feel guilty and full of regret for even bringing it up because I know their hands are tied. I  understand why buckling down on prevention has to be the default. But I also cry my eyes out so often as of late and can't help but feel angry and even hurt at the expectation that I continue to stay stuck in this  indefinitely.

I hate the word suicidal. I just kind of want to blow a kiss, give a wink, and quietly leave the rest of you to enjoy all of the amazing things about life my personal illness &amp; trauma haven't allowed me to. I'm so beyond exhausted. There's so much about being mentally ill... especially poor and mentally ill... especially poor and female and mentally ill... that shame makes it almost impossible to talk about.

Anyways, thank you for listening. I hope this doesn't come across as a pity  party. Running out of medications to try, but I'll be circling back around to generic Zoloft soon.

It’s that time of year again.,"Last year around this time, my life began to devolve into an absolute mess. It gradually got worse until I became completely comfortable with my plan to shoot myself. I had modified a few cartridges to be more lethal, and was starting to plan a day to follow through. I no longer have the pistol, but I do have an old revolver that would probably do the trick. However, I’ve started contemplating hanging (a faster/longer drop) as a less messy way. I do see a therapist, but after seemingly getting better over the summer, I’m devastated to have the depressed feelings starting to creep back in. Regardless of the tricks and helpful info provided by my therapist, I’m following the same path as last year. 

So many on here say the same thing: it’s difficult, but it’ll get better - just keep fighting. However, I don’t know if everyone can overcome this. Maybe I’m just not capable. 

I know plenty on this sub know the helplessness and loneliness that comes with depression and how futile it can seem. Im just not sure that I can make it another fall/winter.

IM SO FUCKING DONE IM DONE IM DONE IM DONE IM DONE IM DONE IM DONE IM DONE IM DONE IM DONE IM DONE,"I want to die. Why the fuck do people want me to suffer in this stupid fucking world just because they dont themselves to suffer from my death? Why would it be selfish to kill myself? Its selfish to keep me in this world just because you dont want to suffer. Life can be wonderful but i dont give a fuck. I dont want to live no matter what so why would i continue.

Dont keep telling me to keep going that it gets better, I DONT GIVE A FUCK! I DONT GIVE A FUCK THAT IT GETS BETTER! I DONT WANT TO LIVE NO MATTER WHAT! keep telling me that i matter and you care about me but you still treat me like shit. Yes i may be annoying person but dont tell me things just to make me feel better. 

You are just hurting me more by telling that you care when you dont really dont. I would feel better if you stopped saying those things.

Why? Why do i have to live? Tell me one good reason other than people care about me or that life gets better. Clearly people dont care about me enough to help me.

I seriously dont want to live. Good days, bad days i want to die. Its like forcing someone to do things he doesnt like. I dont like life so why do i have to live? You dont do things you dont like so why do i have to?

I hope i die. I hope i have the courage to kill myself. I hope i find a fast and painless way to kill myself. I hope the world would end, or humanity. Humans are full of shit and dont deserve to live. We bring so much pain in this fucking universe. We are the cancer of universe.

Please read,"Depressed and anxious

I am new to reddit — I’ve been browsing around for a while now, but I’ve lacked the courage to post anything. I can relate to a lot of what has been posted, and I now feel like it’s time that I share my story:

I grew up in a chaotic household (like I’m sure a lot of you have): my mother was mentally unstable given my father lacked a steady income and was constantly finding and experimenting with entrepreneurial projects that failed to provide our family with any steady source of income. My most vivid memories (when I can actually remember, which is difficult when you have MDD) are my parents fighting constantly about mortgage payments, infidelity on business trips, and lack of extended family support. My parents divorced when I was 12 — I I lived in multiple houses growing up with my mom, and my dad has been in and out of my life ever since, though he’s been more involved these past couple of years (I actually lived on his couch from 25 to 26).

However, fortunately, I was able to push through (or ignore)a lot of these family problems growing up, though I was still considered weird by a lot of people my age. I was an excellent high school student: I graduated with a 4.2 gpa and played two sports in which I was a captain for one them senior year. I went on to an elite private college on the east coast in which I played a varsity sport for 4 years. I had an amazing gf who I loved very much (we were together for 4 years in college, and one year after). I was confident and genuinely believed in myself: I didn’t have a fake belief in myself, but a deep love and care for myself. I graduated with a solid gpa as well as a couple of awards for both sports and academics.

After I graduated, my life spiraled out of control: I became deeply, deeply depressed and started to hate my self, a hatred so deep words cannot describe how I felt. I was stuck at a job that meant nothing to me, and spent my weekends indulging in alcohol and marijuana (my brain doesn’t react well to either of those substances). Each day I started to feel more and more “out of it”, emotionally numb, and dysphoric: I felt nothing, there was nothing to live for, and I stopped enjoying everything that used to bring me meaning and joy. I quit my job after 7 months, and I moved back home, leaving behind everything that I worked hard for: a job, friends that respected me, and a loving gf. 

After moving back, I was EXTREMELY heart broken after leaving my ex: I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t able to be the rock and support system for her anymore, I couldn’t understand why I felt so emotionally numb, and I couldn’t understand why there wasn’t any intimacy or passion in the sex or relationship anymore. I started to question my entire existence and identity, and I fell into the darkest depression a person could fall into: I literally questioned everything — I didn’t know my name, my gender, where I was born, my sexual orientation. Nothing felt real — I couldn’t tell real memories from fake memories. I had no sense of self which was slowly destroying me. 

Fast forward a year - I was living at home, unemployed and miserable. I ended up taking the GRE and applied to a graduate program at an Ivy League school. Got in, did that, but I still hated my self the whole time (depression, dysphoria, anxiety) it was just that I was able to hide it and distract myself in academics.

After getting my grad degree, I moved home, and I failed to keep in contact with everyone I met in school. Again, the cycle continued: depressed, dysphoric, unemployed, anxious, living at home, and lonely. I couldn’t figure out how to hold on to a job or even find one; I just wanted to go back to school again for the third time, take out more loans, and become further in debt. I stopped caring completely, about everything.

I started to watch porn, have sex with random girls to boost my self esteem (it never did) and drink heavily, and I also got into COCAINE, which completely destroyed me: I felt worthless and lost before, oh boy did cocaine just absolutely fuck me up. My delusions and dysphoria started to worsen: my life goal was to become a cocaine dealer in Mexico (started looking at plane tickets) or a lady boy in Thailand. My entire sex drive was in ruins: I had nothing solid to hold onto, again, a very fragile self image around who I was as human being with very intense dysphoria. For example, I would have repeated videos in my brain of being raped over and over again: I genuinely believed I was a victim of childhood rape, but there is no evidence of that. I went on a cocaine and alcohol binge one night, and the only thing I remember is the next morning being driven to the emergency room: I had gotten the shit beat out of me at the bar, been handcuffed  by the cops, driven home by them, and started threatening to kill myself as well as my entire family. At the emergency room, I had an insanely high blood alcohol content as well as cocaine in my system (even the day after). I talked to the social worker/psychologist there, and he determined that I was suicidal and delusional, so he put me in the schizophrenic unit of the psych ward for three days, but after the first day I was moved to the major depression and anxiety unit as they believed that was a better fit. 

I got out after 4 or 5 days, and I went to see a mental health professional voluntarily for the first time since I was a child: I saw a psychologist when I was young, but that was it. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic features, and I was prescribed Abilify and Lexapro. I had been taking both for about a year and a half; however, I went cold turkey on the Lexapro two or three weeks ago and tapered off the Abilify myself a month and a half ago: I just couldn’t stand the weight gain ( I probably gained 50 lbs) and it really didn’t make me feel at peace with myself, it was a bandaid, and I genuinely knew that from the bottom of my heart.

Moved back to the Ivy League town where I graduated from, and I was able to find a job doing consulting work (think about one of those jobs that only rich connected people get); but I quit after 8 months because I wanted to become a professional poker player. I moved to Las Vegas, got an apartment, and started playing at the casinos. Covid happened, I lost my money, and moved back home again. Again, cycle repeats itself. 

I recently found a job in another state doing bullshit office work: think Dilbert or Office Space. But, I have come to terms with it, and I’m doing my best to find joy in the little things. I have completely quit alcohol: it’s not even an option. I’m done with it, forever. Drugs and alcohol absolutely crush me. 

I still have intense bouts of crippling depression and anxiety attacks which I’ve come to realize are fueled by my inability to understand who I am or hold onto any sort of solid self image of myself at the deepest level: this prevents me from seeking out genuine relationships with other people, whether that be friends or a significant other. I am still questioning all aspects of my self: Am I straight or gay? Am I male or female? Where am I from? What is my name? Who are my family members? Memories don’t seem real, nothing seems real anymore. It’s wearing me down, and I can’t imagine that a person could go through so much pain and still exist. It’s a miracle.

I’m seeing a new psychiatrist, and I am hopeful he will help. I’ve been stable before, relatively content and at peace with myself; I am hoping to get back to that place again. I can’t give up.

Thanks for reading.

I Haven't been coping well lately,"All of my friends told me I should move out of my parent's and get an apartment. My old place was very gross and not taken care of, inconveniently located, and I lived with my abusive dad. It seems like getting a place that I can take care of myself would be a good idea right? 

Well I've been here for a while now and I've completely backslid. I'm getting drunk every night, smoking cigarettes like crazy, binge eating. Im spending my money unwisely and I cant stop myself. It's like I'm addicted to things that are bad for me because I want to die so bad that they temporarily distract me. I've been really sick with this infection that keeps coming and going and I haven't been going to see the doctor. I'm procrastinating my school work and the stress is constant. As soon as I do finish work theres just more of it and this makes me think about how that's simply what life is and then I break down and cry because honestly I dont enjoy anything but drugs and food in this life. 

I've given up on my hobbies because they aren't fun anymore. Theres nothing new to do because of covid. ALL of my friends, including my roommate piss me off and I find myself thinking about hurting them just so I'll get thrown in jail and maybe I can work up more nerve to end my own life. I think about stuff like this all the time while at work and while at home, and it's hard to get the thoughts out of my head.

Relating more to people who don't have everything together,"It's just something I've been thinking about lately. On social media and even from close family members, you'll see an endless stream of photos and videos from seemingly happy people having the best time of their lives. Now I understand that social media is generally a curated highlight of someone's life and not everyone is happy all of the time. But I wonder why people make these tireless attempts of pretending to be happy and living great? Wouldn't it be exhausting to live basically a lie which can make you unhappy? It's something that I quite can't understand nor could I relate to since my life isn't the same.   

However, what I've come to grow attached with is people who are just like me: ordinary people who are still trying to figure out their lives. People still learning how to socialize, how to flirt, how to find meaning in what they do, is what I can relate and appreciate more than someone who posts a ""perfect life"". What's sad is that publicly expressing your feelings or insecurities is not as popular as posting a series of tweets or a long YouTube video of living the best life imaginable. I wish it was the other way around because a lot of people would like to see themselves in others and realize that they are not alone.",SasukahUchacha,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhibf0/relating_more_to_people_who_dont_have_everything/,something thinking lately social medium even close family member see endless stream photo video seemingly happy people best time life understand social medium generally curated highlight someone life everyone happy time wonder people make tireless attempt pretending happy living great exhausting live basically lie make unhappy something quite understand could relate since life however come grow attached people like ordinary people still trying figure life people still learning socialize flirt find meaning relate appreciate someone post perfect life sad publicly expressing feeling insecurity popular posting series tweet long youtube video living best life imaginable wish wa way around lot people would like see others realize alone,relating people everything together,asuka hu chach,1251,58,asuka hu chach something thinking lately social medium even close family member see endless stream photo video seemingly happy people best time life understand social medium generally curated highlight someone life everyone happy time wonder people make tireless attempt pretending happy living great exhausting live basically lie make unhappy something quite understand could relate since life however come grow attached people like ordinary people still trying figure life people still learning socialize flirt find meaning relate appreciate someone post perfect life sad publicly expressing feeling insecurity popular posting series tweet long youtube video living best life imaginable wish wa way around lot people would like see others realize alone relating people everything together

Feeling nothing,"I searched for a post like this and there were similar posts on many different subreddit, but nothing coming close to it.

I have a few buddies/friends and even hangout with them from time to time, but the thing is I feel like I don't belong there.. Like I grew up with these people, have MANY of the same tastes and yet we couldn't be more different.

Now this may be, because I'm just not that an interesting person and even when I can add something interesting to the conversation or make a joke related to the topic I usually fuck it up in some way. So there's also that.

I just don't know. At the moment of writing this I'm feeling nothing, wanting to do nothing. Not study to finnish university, not to play games I've been wanting to play forever. I don't care about anything and I hate this feeling, but the alternative is self-hatred/melancholy with happy moods rarely interrupting this vicious cycle.

Not much stopping me from downing a fistful of pills rn,"Not much to care about either. It's a bit liberating when you think about it. It's your own ticket out of here and you're in control.

I ruined my life by rushing through it.,"I'm 16 years old. I promise this isn't one of those ""I'm sad cause I'm graduating high school and don't know what's next"" posts (though there isn't an issue with those). My entire life I've been around adults and people older than me. My brother (19) and I did everything together due to being homeschooled, we were treated like we were twins by everyone. Since it was easier to have us both go to things together, I was always moved to his age group when doing any camps or classes outside of the house. By the time I was 8 I was volunteering at multiple museums and musical venues meaning I was always surrounded by adults who would praise me for ""being so mature"". I started hating my age and distancing myself from ANYTHING that could possibly show that I was a child whatsoever. If people my age were around, I'd make a point to sit straighter, be mature, seem older; and it worked. I was treated as an adult by the time I was 12-13. I first started hanging around people my age recreationally when I was 11, but my main friends were all 15-17. This isn't to say I didn't have some friends my age or didn't do childish things, I just didn't do them as much as most people.
I started college when I was 14 through an early enrollment program at my community college. It was amazing, I was so excited to finally be able to start my adult life. I could pass as 18-19 at that point, mostly because of how I carried myself and how I dressed. I made it an absolute must to hide my age the best I could from the majority of people. I was so afraid of being seen as a child that I'd go to absurd lengths to make SURE nobody except those I wanted to know found out. 
This year, when the pandemic hit, I've realized something. I spent my entire life trying to run as fast as I could into adulthood that I missed the things that are unique to being a child, a teenager even. I'm beyond depressed now. When I was younger I wanted to go to clubs, hook up with people, get a job; but now all I want to do is go to the park, play tag until 9 at night, go to fun little summer camps with a little paper bag and joyfully make new friends. I'm so angry at the world for this year. This would've been the last full year I could be a kid, I'm graduating college next year. I'm finally about to be an adult after years of beating myself up over something I couldn't change.

i just hurt myself,"i was laying in bed with an empty head and it began filling with thoughts about school. i realised that in 2 months 2020 will end and 2021 will begin. 2021 will be my last year of school and i don’t want to leave school. despite me hating to do school work, i don’t want to leave because i’m afraid i will lose my friend group. i’m afraid we will all separate and i will be alone.

 the thing that was bugging me was that i feel that my group have already divided into two and i already separated myself from my friends. sure i’ve been involving myself in conversations with them but i feel that i’m not as close to them anymore. a few of friends have been hanging out with other people, and my remaining friends have found time to hang out with each other outside of school. and there is me, staying in at home during the holidays while looking at my friends’ instagram stories of them having a great time.

it was then i began having thoughts of hurting myself, which i did. i don’t know what to do and i’m scared i might really try and hurt myself severely. i wish i met someone who can really stick with me because i’m afraid of being alone. i want to make friends who i can really relate to but im afraid i might stuff up and people will think i’m weird.",Spooky_Nebula,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jha659/i_just_hurt_myself/,wa laying bed empty head began filling thought school realised 2 month 2020 end 2021 begin 2021 last year school want leave school despite hating school work want leave afraid lose friend group afraid separate alone thing wa bugging wa feel group already divided two already separated friend sure involving conversation feel close anymore friend hanging people remaining friend found time hang outside school staying home holiday looking friend instagram story great time wa began thought hurting know scared might really try hurt severely wish met someone really stick afraid alone want make friend really relate im afraid might stuff people think weird,hurt,spooky nebula,1259,18,spooky nebula wa laying bed empty head began filling thought school realised 2 month 2020 end 2021 begin 2021 last year school want leave school despite hating school work want leave afraid lose friend group afraid separate alone thing wa bugging wa feel group already divided two already separated friend sure involving conversation feel close anymore friend hanging people remaining friend found time hang outside school staying home holiday looking friend instagram story great time wa began thought hurting know scared might really try hurt severely wish met someone really stick afraid alone want make friend really relate im afraid might stuff people think weird hurt

Felt my first bouts of depression when I was 4,"I was in Kindergarten, and we would be making crafts or preparing to eat and I would get this strange feeling. I would often hear this sad weird creepy music in my head and see this picture that looked similar to an ultrasound in an abandoned building. I'd feel this emptyness and pit in my heart. I thought it was ""fun"" and I would constantly think about it, but ofc I didn't know any better it was the very beginning of my mental health decline leading to bipolar and later on diagnosed as BPD as well,  in the hospital. I was diagnosed too late because adults around me failed to help me until it was too late.

Maybe if I was treated super early, I could have been a way better person.

my life is a big bruh moment,"man i wish i was someone else or just stop existing completely, or remove myself and my memories from everyone's life. Everything is hard, getting up from bed, walking, talking, thinking. It's exhausting. I can only feel things by obsessing over useless shit. And they don't even last that much because my mind is so shitty that it guilt trips me anytime i feel happy, and it forces me to ruin everything i like. Every relationship I have always has the same ending; me ending up ghosting my friends because i feel like a burden. I feel like a liar, a hypocrite because I fake everything about my personality to fit in someone's standards. I lie to everyone I know, and they like it. And that's how I keep people around at least for a little while until i ruin it because of selfish reason's like ""i feel like a liar"" ""i feel like a burden"" and leave my friends alone without even an explanation. And then cry about having no one to talk to. Then feel so guilty (as I should) and ashamed and try and reach out to those friends, again for selfish reasons, and fail to do so because of the same guilt and shame that made me try to reach out.

I'm ready to get better and need some suggestions/help,"I've dealt with depression for 20+ years. It probably would have went away in my 20s but when I was 19 I made a big mistake and ended up in some legal trouble that was pretty serious and overshadows anything positive that has come after it. 

Now I'm 35, about to turn 36. I've been a hardcore alcoholic for about 12 years, been through 4 major relationships that I absolutely destroyed, the most recent one being the biggest mistake.  I broke the heart of a sweet girl that loved me more than anything because I was too drunk, depressed and just f**ked up from everything in my past. I just feel like I've wasted my entire life and it makes me even more sad and depressed. 

I've made the decision to stop drinking, I'm determined and it's going to happen, but I have no one in my life and my dog just died, she was my only friend. I want to get better and the drinking will stop but the future already looks so gloomy. I don't know where to make friends or meet new people, but I known I need them. I can't do this 100% alone. I'm not going to get better sitting around in my room alone or wasting time on my PC. I dont understand how to be happy or enjoy time alone with myself. I don't know who I am any more or what I enjoy but I need to get out of this rut. This pandemic shutdown bulls**t isn't helping either, its hard to meet people when everything is shut down.

A coworker suggested Facebook and finding local groups... which I'd really rather not, since I loathe social media, but I don't know where else to reach out.

I have found myself in this deteriorating mental state and don’t know anything else to do besides hope someone out there can help me in any way.

Tomorrow's my birthday,"I'm turning 23 tomorrow. 2020 has drained my bank account, dashed any chances I had of moving out of my Mom's house, left me unemployed and unable to find work, and made my already bad depression a thousand times worse. I have no energy or motivation to do any of my hobbies, I have nothing good to say to the few friends I have left (including my siblings), the only people I've talked to for the past 7 months are my roommates (my Mom and her friend from work), I dropped out of college last year and have no solid plans for returning, I sleep most of the day because there's no reason to be awake, and most nights I spend hours thinking about my dead dog and crying. I still have energy to cook and do chores and that brings me a little bit of happiness, but beyond that I have nothing. I feel like a pathetic fucking leech. If I had any money I would be a full-blown alcoholic by now, and the only reason I haven't killed myself is because my Mom would be sad and I know the cost of a funeral would be a huge financial burden on her.

On the bright side, at least no one I know has or had Covid and I still have a place to live. I'll still try sending out job applications for fast food places or cleaning companies, even though I spent the past 6 months getting rejected or ignored. I'll make a doctor's appointment over Zoom to start medication again, because without it I have no will to live and I want that back.

How bad my day has been so far,"In the morning my day was fantastic. I went down town with friends and hung out gm for pretty much all day right. And then I go to a friends house and we were just chilling and I felt like I needed to get weight off my chest. So I decided to tell my crush that I liked her. So I asked her out and she leaves me on read for like 15 mins and then starts typing. She typed that she didn’t like me that way and she just thought of me as a friend. Now when I tell you I like this girl, I mean this girl was my everything. I loved her more than anything In the world. She’s got a awesome personality, she loves bucket hats, she’s got brown hair down to the bottom of her shoulder blades, bright hawai water colour Ed eyes, the most beautiful smile, the full package. Now let me tell you, this devastated me. This hurt so fucking much. But at first I was sad but not super sad, so I went to go play among us. I was just chilling playing among us and my sadness gradually got worse so I told some dudes on among us about what had happened and they were so nice. They seriously helped so much. But of course my shitty phone decides to disconnect. Ofc I missed them but I couldn’t find their game. I searched for like 30 mins but couldn’t find it again. That sucked. But I also told some other people about it and they also cheered me up but it has continued to get worse and now I’m just really fucking sad. I just felt like I had to post this and idk why, I just did. Just going to mention that this is probably the 4th time I’ve been rejected and it’s starting to piss me off. Also another thing is last year this goddess of a girl was dating a ginger asshole called Quin. Now let me tell you, this kid is a moron. He literally lied about him playing boxing, kickboxing, karate, wrestling, basketball and so on. He also makes lies to other people about beating me and my friends up all by himself even though we would beat the shit outta him and that kinda thing. Now let’s go back to the fact that she dated this Asshole and not me. I’m practically a comedian, and I look like mongraal. What else could you want from a dude. My personality is also god(just saying) and I’ve got a mustache at 13. Like bruh. Today is just shit

I think I’m sad today for a few reasons. I turned a year older and still feel like I haven’t accomplished anything in my life. I feel like I’ve wasted so much time doing nothing and not achieving anything. I feel this type of loneliness today because it really shows how little people I have in my life that care about me. Literally my only friend is my best friend from high school. And I feel guilty for the attention. I feel guilty because she is probably only hanging out with me because she knows I don’t have anyone else. I find myself comparing my situation to others.

I can pretend to be happy and normal to other people and I live with my gf so I don’t really like her seeing me get upset much but every once in a while like once a month or so I’ll have a night to myself where I can just let my feelings come out entirely. Alone, some sad music, a few drinks, and cry.
It’s probably not healthy but I find it extremely cathartic to just let all that raw pent up emotion come out when I’m alone and safe.

Thinking about suicide and life in general,"Just the thoughts of at the end nothing really does matter at all, I feel empty. I also just went through a breakup a couple weeks ago, I was the person to end things. But aside from that I just feel really depressed. I think even when I was with them I always had the thoughts of suicide and even now. Nothing is majorly going wrong but I just feel not much of a person. 

I just think of the reality of things, we’re literally specs floating. We’re actually just a big germ consuming other things so that we can be alive. Like tobacco and stuff it’s just random stuff we consume as humans. It’s weird and I can’t shake that mentality I have. I’ve done acid and shrooms (and pills weed etc nothing too hard) many many times before and I feel maybe it has permanently damaged my mentality. 

I just feel depressed, I feel a fake kind of happy where I am overly happy and overly interested in things I don’t care about. Like a broken leg and and saying “ohhh my god what happened? Wow that’s crazy dude wow I hope you get better” shit like that. 

I’m turning 22 I’m a female, I don’t know why I feel this way but I just see my life very pointless and as though there’s nothing really important on earth we are all equal yet we are all nothing at the same time. I just really think I’m going to kill myself soon it sucks to think like that or how to stop thinking that way but it really sucks. 

I don’t know I used to think about killing myself as a teen only because of some fucked childhood trauma I have going. Never killed myself mainly because of my little sisters. Yet now the more I think of it I feel I don’t really care and I should just end everything: not many people care about me in real life and I barely care about myself.",spritebabyy,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhk6yg/thinking_about_suicide_and_life_in_general/,thought end nothing really doe matter feel empty also went breakup couple week ago wa person end thing aside feel really depressed think even wa always thought suicide even nothing majorly going wrong feel much person think reality thing literally spec floating actually big germ consuming thing alive like tobacco stuff random stuff consume human weird shake mentality done acid shrooms pill weed etc nothing hard many many time feel maybe ha permanently damaged mentality feel depressed feel fake kind happy overly happy overly interested thing care like broken leg saying ohhh god happened wow crazy dude wow hope get better shit like turning 22 female know feel way see life pointless though nothing really important earth equal yet nothing time really think going kill soon suck think like stop thinking way really suck know used think killing teen fucked childhood trauma going never killed mainly little sister yet think feel really care end everything many people care real life barely care,thinking suicide life general,sprite baby,1737,42,sprite baby thought end nothing really doe matter feel empty also went breakup couple week ago wa person end thing aside feel really depressed think even wa always thought suicide even nothing majorly going wrong feel much person think reality thing literally spec floating actually big germ consuming thing alive like tobacco stuff random stuff consume human weird shake mentality done acid shrooms pill weed etc nothing hard many many time feel maybe ha permanently damaged mentality feel depressed feel fake kind happy overly happy overly interested thing care like broken leg saying ohhh god happened wow crazy dude wow hope get better shit like turning 22 female know feel way see life pointless though nothing really important earth equal yet nothing time really think going kill soon suck think like stop thinking way really suck know used think killing teen fucked childhood trauma going never killed mainly little sister yet think feel really care end everything many people care real life barely care thinking suicide life general

I just spent the last 5 hours just going through other peoples Instagram's from college,"I've been horribly depressed since graduation in may 2018. broke up with my gf of 2 years at the time. got a shit job right after college in the middle of nowhere. During that time, still depressed about the break up have been feeling nothing but regret of missing out on a lot of college experiences : Rushing a fraternity, new friendships, social/Greek events, wild fraternity parties where hundreds of random girls show up, and dancing and getting laid with women. 

I quit my shitty job after 3 months moved back with my parents. Became a stoner to suppress the sadness. Didn't try out on dates. Became more anxious and insecure about my sex life and body count. Got a good job in november'18 and thought it would be smart to live with them for a year to save up and potentially buy a house. Job turned me into bit of a workaholic and was still a stoner. Was not having fun and when i did was not enjoying it. Depressed and saw a therapist for a bit then stopped when it became 2020. Pandemic hasn't been helping because has put things I wanna do to make up for what i missed on delay.

I've felt extremely depressed since May. Was smoking even more with WFH and not even enjoying it anymore. Made me so anxious. Stopping briefly also made me anxious because I thought about how much time I've wasted being a stoner.

It is now October. I am 24yo and in Jan will be 25.  I have not smoked for about 2 months. However : My job has been shit the last few months. I'm seeing a therapist again. Psychiatrist diagnosed me with depression (again) and add. On heavy meds. Still living with my parents. Haven't been looking for a house because thinking of looking for another job. Haven't looked for another job because work has been burning me out. Started dating again however about 4 weeks ago (before meds) I suddenly lost my libido and all arousal. I don't get aroused looking at girls or feel horney anymore. A girl came over to my place. First time in 18 months i was going to have sex and i can't get an erection. fml. just my luck and what depressed guy needs right? Don't even want to go on dating apps currently because I feel no arousal still. I am trying to get my body count up because of insecurity and this happens. More fucking delay. 

Now I've cycled back into looking at peoples Instagram's for hours and looking at like TFM insta pages and collegesluts subreddit just thinking of how much I've missed out on. How naïve i was when i was younger. Wishing i had rushed. Wishing i did all these things i mentioned earlier before getting into a happy relationship in junior year. I think how all my friends from high school i still hang out with were in frats. 3 of them were engineers as well and they were in frats and boy did they have fun.

I was so naïve to not rush. I thought ""I had enough friends and partied enough in high school"" boy was i wrong and it didn't even compare. Everyone i went to high school with went to the same instate college as me and joined Greek life. And boy were the parties more than i ever expected to be and i will never get to experience that. I wish I could've been to just one. All i can do is imagine the events/girls that go on inside those fraternity houses. 

And now i am typing out something maybe 1-2 strangers will see pitying myself and making myself feel down and not in the mood to look for jobs because i want to cry right now. I don't want to die, but hard not to give up and do things and enjoy things and look forward. I keep looking back and can't seem to stop from doing it. I know those opportunities I'm talking about are long past my time and I accept that but its sad to accept it.",xyz9100,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhgh6l/i_just_spent_the_last_5_hours_just_going_through/,horribly depressed since graduation may 2018 broke gf 2 year time got shit job right college middle nowhere time still depressed break feeling nothing regret missing lot college experience rushing fraternity new friendship social greek event wild fraternity party hundred random girl show dancing getting laid woman quit shitty job 3 month moved back parent became stoner suppress sadness try date became anxious insecure sex life body count got good job november 18 thought would smart live year save potentially buy house job turned bit workaholic wa still stoner wa fun wa enjoying depressed saw therapist bit stopped became 2020 pandemic helping ha put thing wanna make missed delay felt extremely depressed since may wa smoking even wfh even enjoying anymore made anxious stopping briefly also made anxious thought much time wasted stoner october 24yo jan 25 smoked 2 month however job ha shit last month seeing therapist psychiatrist diagnosed depression add heavy med still living parent looking house thinking looking another job looked another job work ha burning started dating however 4 week ago med suddenly lost libido arousal get aroused looking girl feel horney anymore girl came place first time 18 month wa going sex get erection fml luck depressed guy need right even want go dating apps currently feel arousal still trying get body count insecurity happens fucking delay cycled back looking people instagram hour looking like tfm insta page collegesluts subreddit thinking much missed naïve wa wa younger wishing rushed wishing thing mentioned earlier getting happy relationship junior year think friend high school still hang frat 3 engineer well frat boy fun wa naïve rush thought enough friend partied enough high school boy wa wrong even compare everyone went high school went instate college joined greek life boy party ever expected never get experience wish could one imagine event girl go inside fraternity house typing something maybe 1 2 stranger see pitying making feel mood look job want cry right want die hard give thing enjoy thing look forward keep looking back seem stop know opportunity talking long past time accept sad accept,spent last 5 hour going people instagram college,xyz 9100,3652,87,xyz 9100 horribly depressed since graduation may 2018 broke gf 2 year time got shit job right college middle nowhere time still depressed break feeling nothing regret missing lot college experience rushing fraternity new friendship social greek event wild fraternity party hundred random girl show dancing getting laid woman quit shitty job 3 month moved back parent became stoner suppress sadness try date became anxious insecure sex life body count got good job november 18 thought would smart live year save potentially buy house job turned bit workaholic wa still stoner wa fun wa enjoying depressed saw therapist bit stopped became 2020 pandemic helping ha put thing wanna make missed delay felt extremely depressed since may wa smoking even wfh even enjoying anymore made anxious stopping briefly also made anxious thought much time wasted stoner october 24yo jan 25 smoked 2 month however job ha shit last month seeing therapist psychiatrist diagnosed depression add heavy med still living parent looking house thinking looking another job looked another job work ha burning started dating however 4 week ago med suddenly lost libido arousal get aroused looking girl feel horney anymore girl came place first time 18 month wa going sex get erection fml luck depressed guy need right even want go dating apps currently feel arousal still trying get body count insecurity happens fucking delay cycled back looking people instagram hour looking like tfm insta page collegesluts subreddit thinking much missed naïve wa wa younger wishing rushed wishing thing mentioned earlier getting happy relationship junior year think friend high school still hang frat 3 engineer well frat boy fun wa naïve rush thought enough friend partied enough high school boy wa wrong even compare everyone went high school went instate college joined greek life boy party ever expected never get experience wish could one imagine event girl go inside fraternity house typing something maybe 1 2 stranger see pitying making feel mood look job want cry right want die hard give thing enjoy thing look forward keep looking back seem stop know opportunity talking long past time accept sad accept spent last 5 hour going people instagram college

Sudden feeling of intense nihilism,"I've been dealing with some depression for the last few months.

 Yesterday after work I was hanging out with my wife, we talked a lot and I was feeling kind of manic. Usually I just crash when I get home from work and sit on the couch for hours until bedtime, but last night I showered and had some caffeine, then we started talking and didn't really stop for a couple of hours. I started feeling really hyper focused, like if I had taken a stimulant, and was pacing and fiddling with stuff. I also had a few drinks after a couple of hours of this. Now today I feel extremely nihilist. 

I'm not sure if that's the right word to use, but I just literally don't care about anything. I don't care about eating. I don't care about my job. I don't care about my relationships. I just feel extremely neutral. Like I just want to exist and not care about anything and be left alone to do whatever.

 It's a really strange feeling and was wondering if anyone could relate or had any advice.

Just an insignificamt depression post.,"Today, I went to visit my older cousin that just had another son. It was a nice visit.

On the way home, I thought about how lonely I was and how I'll never have a family, never get married or do the things Ive always wanted to do in life. Because I'm hideous, useless and I will not EVER not think these things about myself.

Like music. I always wanted to be a musician but my mother tells me today that I turned down her attempts to get me into music. I honestly can say that I do not remember her being receptive to me wanting to play music because she wanted me to do something that guranteed me a good living. This makes me hate myself more. Why the fuck would I say no to learning instruments??? I did not believe her at first but she would not lie to me about that. So, yeah. I'm an idiot. I'm getting a masters in IT but I do not even really care because I wish I were a musician. But i have no talent in music and I'm 28 years old. So I feel like my life is a wasted one. This is why I hate female singers like Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, Beyoncé, etc. I feel that most of the accolades they recieve is undeserved and that I should be up there. It is very depressing and annoying.

She also can not wrap her head around the fact that when I look in the mirror, I'm absolutely dusgusted at what I see. I LOATHE my appearance and always have. And apparently, everyone else did to. I was called ""ugly"" constantly by classmates and family. She can not even fathom why in the world I would think that. Of course she says I'm pretty. I'm her daughter. 

I am a waste of life. If I could give my life for someone who died prematurely, I would do it, no questions asked, no second thoughts.

I'm 28, single, very very ugly with a soft cervix (I had a miscarriage because of this years ago). Marriage, children or even a relationship just are not in the cards for me and it is extremely difficult to face. My mom constantly tells me that she is confident that I will have a family but I jist have seen way too many women want children but never have them. If I do not have a family, I just do not know what I would do. I would feel completely useless. I will probably kill myself. I just would not see the point of living anymore.

I am not significant. I do not enrich anyone's life. I'm just a loser with too much self-awareness. I hate everything about myself. Everything.

Anyone I talk to just does not understand where I'm coming from. They question why I'm even depressed. But you would be depressed to if the main thing you ever wanted just is not meant to be. 

I just want to fucking jump off a cliff.

P.S. Depressed people make the worst pet parents and I'm one of them. Just another reason to hate myself. All this shit just really makes me want to kill myself but I'm too chicken to do that.

"I always think I’m happy, then it’s over in a couple days, hours, even minutes. I don’t know what to do anymore.","I was diagnosed with depression two years ago, I’m 14 and it was because of some issues with my mum. She’s given me severe trauma, and even nightmares. I’ve been living with my grandparents while she gets her shit together. Whilst living here, I’ve felt genuine happiness. This is the place I grew up in. My mum would drop me off and go party or something. My safe space. Recently, it doesn’t feel like that anymore. I’ve always had issues with sleeping, and they’ve acknowledged that. I don’t have friends to talk to in real life, I’m homeschooled so it makes it really difficult to make friends. I’ve always talked to people online. I’ve been clean for 4 months until a few days ago. I was up at like 4 am, talking to friends, since it was a weekend. My grandmother woke up and came in my room. I knew I shouldn’t have been up so I sat there and just listened. It was all fine until she said this: “You’re just as responsible as your mother.” I Instantly got the feeling again and just went mad. She keeps mocking me now. Mumbling to herself about how I’m useless. I told my grandad that when she yells it reminds me of my mum and that’s why I get emotional. I guess he told her and she got pissed. Now i feel like I can’t open up to anyone. I need to vent. So desperately. I don’t want to bother my friends with shit they don’t care about. Someone simply asking me if I’m okay, or how I’m doing, makes me want to ball my eyes out. I ruin everything for myself. I can be given a simple thing to do, like clean my room, and I won’t do it. Even if I want to, I won’t. I’m lazy, useless and wasting people’s time. I don’t want to die. I just want to stop being a bother all the time. I don’t know how to escape this anymore.

I have no motivation.,"I haven't done this type of thing before.

I'm 20 and M, and have been single for over 3 years. I've been dealing with severe depression and social anxiety for most of my life, and I can't find the strength anymore. For a while I got my shit together and lived somewhat peacefully, but as time goes on, I've realized that all I'm fighting for is pointless. The job I'm working is good, but my coworkers and boss don't really like me all that much, it might be due to the fact that I don't know as much as they do, because I'm trying to edge my way into the cooking scene. Like I mentioned earlier, I haven't been in a relationship in years, and have almost no friends. I'm always alone every night, no one to really ""hang out"" with. Sure I'll play games with some old friends, but time has changed things and it's not the same anymore. I'm extremely lonely, as I live alone, and I cant' make friends, Covid's not helping either.

"I need serious help. How can I constantly be in a state of self-hatred? Every time my depression gives way to a moment of confidence or positivity, disaster immediately strikes.","Some would say this is cherophobia, however this is not an irrational fear but confirmed fact for me.

Yesterday I was happy because today was going to be a productive day. I was going to get up early and spend all day making phone calls for a good cause. I prayed to God for blessing and to avoid pride/self reliance because I know how much of a worthless fuck up I am. I made the mistake of feeling optimistic, of feeling anything but crushing self hatred and anxiety.

I woke up late, right when the event was supposed to start. I was so devastated at the realization of how much of disgusting failure I lied in bed for an extra hour then spent the entire day trying to summon the will to join in still, thinking about how I'm so worthless it might be better if I don't join in, and that I'm too much of a fuck-up failure scumbag cunt to ever improve.

"My mind is a fun escape, at least.","Until I’m reminded it’s all in my head.

But that’s it, that’s my only cope. I just imagine a better reality, one where I’m not so desperately alone, not a disappointment, not so completely disinterested with the world around me, and one where I feel, at least, contented. I’ve come to realize that if ‘The Matrix’ was real, I would never want to leave. Even if I knew it was all fake, I wouldn’t care.

I’m so tired of waiting for life to finally get better and I’ve expended all realistic means (due to my own ineptitude) that for the time being I’ll just dream my life away.

Worried about taking Sertraline,"(First of all I’m 18) So about 3-4 months ago I started nothing a change In myself. First it was the immediate loss of libido. My libido has pretty much been gone ever since apart from maybe last week or two where I noticed an increase. Since those 3-4 months I’ve pretty much experienced no happiness with myself, around others, felt blank most of the time and slept a bit and also felt bored and a lack of motivation.

Went doctors in September for a month and he was useless and just ignored me. In October I moved house to my friends family for college and things started to seem a bit better since I was away from home. Somewhat better I should say. But I still had days where I woke up completely drained, felt like a complete zombie, sometimes had some anxiety within me and overthought things but the one thing that somewhat seemed to come back was my libido.

So since I started experiencing those days where I woke up to a day of emptiness I decided to go doctor and get a counsellor/therapy. The doctor prescribed me Sertraline and after taking one pill tonight (I know it sounds a bit ridiculous just being the first day) im not sure it’s the right move for me.

Reasonings for it is due to researching online and the side effects and the main one being low libido. I have a girlfriend and she is fully understanding with the whole situation however usually I am quite a sexually active person and the past 3-4 months have been frustrating for me having low libido. And now when I get prescribed SSRI’s after just noticing a small rise in my libido worries me to think that I’ll have no libido for even longer. My doctor has also given me Sildenafil (viagra) however I don’t want to rely on it. Another reason for me worrying to take them is due to college and risking the meds causing my college work and life harder than it already is. 

Any advice is welcome? I’m torn between just laying off the SSRI’s and contacting my doctor while continuing the counselling and seeing where that’ll take me or should I continue to give Sertraline a run for a month or two and see how that plays into affect?",Mymumfoundadonkey,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhji4l/worried_about_taking_sertraline/,first 18 3 4 month ago started nothing change first wa immediate loss libido libido ha pretty much gone ever since apart maybe last week two noticed increase since 3 4 month pretty much experienced happiness around others felt blank time slept bit also felt bored lack motivation went doctor september month wa useless ignored october moved house friend family college thing started seem bit better since wa away home somewhat better say still day woke completely drained felt like complete zombie sometimes anxiety within overthought thing one thing somewhat seemed come back wa libido since started experiencing day woke day emptiness decided go doctor get counsellor therapy doctor prescribed sertraline taking one pill tonight know sound bit ridiculous first day im sure right move reasoning due researching online side effect main one low libido girlfriend fully understanding whole situation however usually quite sexually active person past 3 4 month frustrating low libido get prescribed ssri noticing small rise libido worry think libido even longer doctor ha also given sildenafil viagra however want rely another reason worrying take due college risking med causing college work life harder already advice welcome torn laying ssri contacting doctor continuing counselling seeing take continue give sertraline run month two see play affect,worried taking sertraline,mum found donkey,2110,31,mum found donkey first 18 3 4 month ago started nothing change first wa immediate loss libido libido ha pretty much gone ever since apart maybe last week two noticed increase since 3 4 month pretty much experienced happiness around others felt blank time slept bit also felt bored lack motivation went doctor september month wa useless ignored october moved house friend family college thing started seem bit better since wa away home somewhat better say still day woke completely drained felt like complete zombie sometimes anxiety within overthought thing one thing somewhat seemed come back wa libido since started experiencing day woke day emptiness decided go doctor get counsellor therapy doctor prescribed sertraline taking one pill tonight know sound bit ridiculous first day im sure right move reasoning due researching online side effect main one low libido girlfriend fully understanding whole situation however usually quite sexually active person past 3 4 month frustrating low libido get prescribed ssri noticing small rise libido worry think libido even longer doctor ha also given sildenafil viagra however want rely another reason worrying take due college risking med causing college work life harder already advice welcome torn laying ssri contacting doctor continuing counselling seeing take continue give sertraline run month two see play affect worried taking sertraline
Need advice: How can I help my depressed best friend and save our friendship?,"Hi there folks!

Like the title says, I really could need some advice from you regarding the relationship with my depressed best friend. I suffered from depression for several years myself, so it's not like I'm clueless on this matter, but still, I'm slowly reaching my limits.

Even though, it's not certain that he suffers from depression, since he absolutely refuses to visit any kind of therapist and doesn't have a diagnosis, I personally believe that his symptoms are quite clear. It wasn't always as bad as today, but now most of the time he is either sad, bitter, grumpy, feeling hopeless or getting hurt so easily that I sometimes don't even know what I should say to him, as I feel like I'm walking on eggshells. 

He's a convinced pessimist and has an extreme negative view of the world and himself. Basically, he always talking himself down, going on about how useless he is, that he doesn't have any talents or positive qualities, how he doesn't understand why I would want to have him as my best friend or how unhappy he is with almost every aspect of his life. 

Still, he doesn't do anything about it and also refused any help from others. Whenever I try to come up with solutions for him, he doesn't even consider them, but instatly starts looking for excuses in order to not even try - even when these excuses often are complete nonsense. He's probably trying to protect himself from the potential dissappointment of these solutions not working, but apparently doesn't realize that he's just setting himself up for even more dissapoinments and suffering.

But guess what? I still love him and not a single one of these things will change that he's still my best friend and that naturally I want to help him. But that's excactly the issue: he refuses any help. Even though he often complains about being unhappy and even though he has a childhood diagnosis for adhd and is suspecting himself that he also might have bipolar disorder, he doesn't seem to even care about getting any professional help. 

But it's not only about professional help. Recently, he also began stonewalling, whenever I try to help him. I don't believe he's doing that on purpose, but rather that he doesn't even acknowlegde his own feelings himself. He always had issues with showing any sign ""weakness"" and admiting his own mistakes. So, even if he's obviously upset, angry or hurt, he will absolutely deny it. Personally, I think that's his most serious issue right now, since it ruins any chance of improvement.

He is a very emotional, sometimes even upright irrational, person. For him, the world he sees through the lens of his own emotions is the only real one and he is either not able or not willing to try and understand the views and feelings of other people. 

Also, even though he defenitely has issues with his self-image and confidence, paradoxically he still is a very prideful person. On one hand, he's full of self-hate and self-pity and on the other hand  he likes to boast a lot and will fight anyone who is even only slightly cricitcizing him. This mix of pride and emotionality often leads to him feeling extremely hurt by and resentful  towards others, even when the only thing they did was disagreeing with him. 

On top of that, it also makes him inaccessible to any rational arguments, since he only listens to his own emotions. This one is so extreme, he doesn't even change his mind when confronted with facts, stone-cold evidence or when basically EVERYONE is disagreeing with him. There's absolute no approach  to make him rethink and eventually admit when he's wrong - neither being compassionate and understanding nor getting angry with him or proving him wrong on a rational level.

Naturally, at this point our relationship is starting to take its toll on me. I'm still commited to this friendship and I really don't want to give up on it, but I'm afraid that his behaviour is slowly destroying our bond of trust. As it is now, I'm always the one having to make compromises. When we fight, I'm the one who has to apologize. He seldom goes out of his way and tries to be considerate of MY views and emotions, he never tries to put himself in my shoes, even though I always try to understand HIM. He doesn't support me on an emotional level anymore, while I still do it for him nonetheless, and recently he even started blaming me and others for things that are actually his own responsibility.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to pierce through his stonewalling? How can I convice him to accept help and stop wallowing in self-pity for the remainder of his life, when he doesn't even listen to rational arguments? What can I do to stop our friendship from deteriorating before it's too late?",Rettichaufreddit,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jh9j8y/need_advice_how_can_i_help_my_depressed_best/,hi

It's been over three years since I've hung out with someone (besides at school).,"The title says it all. 

Now that I think about it, it's no wonder why I always complain and ask people if they want to play video games with me. I want some positive attention—I want someone to make me laugh and help me get through my school years. 

My best friend, let's call her Kacy, hasn't messaged me in almost three years, and I remember crying because she no longer wanted to hang out with me. It was pretty pathetic, to be honest, but it's hard to describe the loss I felt. I lost my only friend, the girl I played Minecraft for eight+ hours with on the weekend, and she also shared almost all of my interests. It was like we were made for each other.  

I always forgave her for lying and using me because I loved her. Not romantically, but as a sister. I felt happy whenever she messaged me and sad when we had to sleep because we had school in the morning. 

I have friends. I hang out with them at school, but that's where it stays. Once I leave that building, we don't talk until we're back in that building. Is that normal? Is it normal to not hang out with your friends?

I don't know, but my mom said it isn't. I think I'm touch starved, too. My mom and dad are not all touchy-feely; my dad less so than my mom so that I can go weeks without any physical contact. 

I'm baffled. (Thanks Grammarly, for that incredible new word choice—baffled!)

First attempt at this.,I am at an all time low. I was out of a job for several months struggling with anxiety and physical pains. I finally get a new job inspecting/cleaning car parts  thanks to a friend and I am unable to keep up. I am falling behind on my line. I constantly need help or need to ask how to do something again. mix this with the fact that due to my shift all of my social time with friends has gone away and I couldn't handle it anymore. I needed this job to stay a float since I have had no money to my name in almost six months and the health benefits could have helped my transition since I am a closeted trans woman. I quit the job today and I have fallen into suicidal depression because I just can't see myself finding a job that I can do that also provides the resources I need.

High school life and sadness,"Hey, just wanted to vent here about something that I’ve been struggling with for so long but no one seems to understand. I’m not exactly an antisocial person, I have friends but I live in a very rural area where I can’t walk or bike to friends houses and don’t have a license either so I can’t do much. I watch anime sometimes and some shows that depict the typical “high school life” walking to and from school and around a small town or a city or something with drama and whatever always seemed so appealing to me, and as a senior I feel like I missed out on so much and it really sucks. High school is supposed to be a time where people thing back on fondly, it’s the last time to be a kid right? I don’t know really but I just feel like shit watching those shows knowing I’ll never have a life like that or a romance like that or be able to do any of those things for the rest of my life, at least during high school. I know the stuff in those shows is fiction but it really makes me contemplate what I’ve done up until this point and makes me feel really inadequate, like I wanna go back and live somewhere else and do everything all over again.

Making being alone bearable for my girlfriend,"Hello reddit,

full disclosure: 

1. I'm not the affected person, I'm here to better understand my girlfriend in order to help her.
2. For privacy reasons, this is not my main account. I'm not in a position to decide which of our friends should know about the situation and my primary account is very well known unfortunately.

Back to topic. My girlfriend of two years has been diagnosed with depression many years ago. Without going into detail too much at this point I would like to help her with one of the most difficult times she has. Being alone.  
Due to our schedules there are times at which she has to be alone for a few hours or sometimes a few days. Due to our respective jobs this is unavoidable. 

Unfortunately, being alone is absolutely unbearable for her. It renders her completely numb up to a point at which she doesn't even have the energy to get up in the morning or leave her couch. If I am away for a few days she manages the first day, sometimes the second day but at the third everything falls apart and she calls in sick at work, doesn't respond to calls, is unable to take care of her pets as well as herself. At times it renders her completely immobile. Since at this point I am usually far away I want to help her in order to prevent or at least delay this.

Something I noticed is that she tends to watch movies when she cannot find the energy to get up from the couch but this has a caveat. Her entire situation worsens drastically or improves slightly, depending on the movie. This is why my first idea is to get her a selection of ""safe"" movies to watch that I know would take her mind of for a while and hopefully give her the chance to recover. Unfortunately I don't know how I could find acceptable movies. As of right now the two most effective are ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" as well as ""Zootopia"". She absolutely adores animals and spending time with them or even just watching them relaxes her a lot. Because of this, movies in which animals are abused or killed are an absolute taboo, as well as obviously everything that reminds her of her own situation. Could you recommend more movies that would fit into this category of ""feel good"" movies? Preferably with real actors and animals, Zootopia is so far the only animated movies she enjoyed. 

The only other thing I can think of that really helps her are real animals but her pets are not always in the mood to get pets and without the energy to get up, she wouldn't go outside.

I would really appreciate if you could recommend more movies I could get her for her library or if you could give my any other tips how to handle such a situation when I am physically out of reach. 

It is very difficult for me to fully grasp how she feels because in many aspects, I'm the exact opposite. Please keep that in mind when my descriptions of her situations seem vague. 

I'm trying to help her and be supportive but without understanding her situation that is very difficult. Thank you very much for your help.",foxInADistance,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhf2r8/making_being_alone_bearable_for_my_girlfriend/,hello reddit full disclosure 1 affected person better understand girlfriend order help 2 privacy reason main account position decide friend know situation primary account well known unfortunately back topic girlfriend two year ha diagnosed depression many year ago without going detail much point would like help one difficult time ha alone due schedule time ha alone hour sometimes day due respective job unavoidable unfortunately alone absolutely unbearable render completely numb point even energy get morning leave couch away day manages first day sometimes second day third everything fall apart call sick work respond call unable take care pet well time render completely immobile since point usually far away want help order prevent least delay something noticed tends watch movie cannot find energy get couch ha caveat entire situation worsens drastically improves slightly depending movie first idea get selection safe movie watch know would take mind hopefully give chance recover unfortunately know could find acceptable movie right two effective fantastic beast find well zootopia absolutely adores animal spending time even watching relaxes lot movie animal abused killed absolute taboo well obviously everything reminds situation could recommend movie would fit category feel good movie preferably real actor animal zootopia far animated movie enjoyed thing think really help real animal pet always mood get pet without energy get go outside would really appreciate could recommend movie could get library could give tip handle situation physically reach difficult fully grasp feel many aspect exact opposite please keep mind description situation seem vague trying help supportive without understanding situation difficult thank much help,making alone bearable girlfriend,fox distance,3011,45,fox distance hello reddit full disclosure 1 affected person better understand girlfriend order help 2 privacy reason main account position decide friend know situation primary account well known unfortunately back topic girlfriend two year ha diagnosed depression many year ago without going detail much point would like help one difficult time ha alone due schedule time ha alone hour sometimes day due respective job unavoidable unfortunately alone absolutely unbearable render completely numb point even energy get morning leave couch away day manages first day sometimes second day third everything fall apart call sick work respond call unable take care pet well time render completely immobile since point usually far away want help order prevent least delay something noticed tends watch movie cannot find energy get couch ha caveat entire situation worsens drastically improves slightly depending movie first idea get selection safe movie watch know would take mind hopefully give chance recover unfortunately know could find acceptable movie right two effective fantastic beast find well zootopia absolutely adores animal spending time even watching relaxes lot movie animal abused killed absolute taboo well obviously everything reminds situation could recommend movie would fit category feel good movie preferably real actor animal zootopia far animated movie enjoyed thing think really help real animal pet always mood get pet without energy get go outside would really appreciate could recommend movie could get library could give tip handle situation physically reach difficult fully grasp feel many aspect exact opposite please keep mind description situation seem vague trying help supportive without understanding situation difficult thank much help making alone bearable girlfriend

How do I support my partner during his depressive episodes ?,"My man is un-medicated.  He goes through cycles (approximately every 3 weeks) of a major breakdown where he’s down and totally out for anywhere from a couple days to a few weeks.  

In the past I didn’t know what was happening so I would give him his space.


Recently I’ve been showing up consistently on my own volition. Coming and cooking for him, helping him with household chores and errands, just hanging out and watching a movie/listening to records etc. I am in school and sometimes just come over and study in the other room for a couple hours. 

This is new for him. I didn’t realize that for a longtime he was covertly asking for this level of presence.  

Unfortunately now that it is here, I can’t help but feel like it’s not helpful to him.  I know he feels pressure to make love to me and take care of me in return. I have tried to assure him that I love him at his worst and his best, and expect nothing from him when he is this state. 


Should I give him space or keep showing up and loving him loudly?

Felt like parents (mom) sabotaged my life.,"I guess I just needed to get this off my chest.  I feel like my whole life my mom has always kind of attempted to sabotaged my life.  I was always a hard working (straight A) student in high school but my parents encouraged me to take the easier classes in school.  I was always a passionate swimmer but wasn't allowed to practice very competitively because my mom said I should be well rounded. So when I failed to make the swim team she called to complain to the coach and blamed him.  Anyways after working my but off in high school I got into my top college and wasn't allowed to go and was instead told to go to the university 10 minutes from our house.  I wanted to study diseases and go into biology but I was told I must go into engineering.  I have no passion for engineering and am finishing up my 5th year in May.  I feel as if I've wasted my college years just studying. I'm getting extremely depressed and never thought I would get to this point. But I don't have energy to maintain any of my friendships or respond to any text messages.  With engineering I used to wake up and study for all hours of the day but now I'm just extremely burnt out. Its hard to get out of bed but I am able to do it.  I was not really able to explore the things I was passionate about in college or grow in any way. I just feel like I've wasted my potential in life and that it wasn't even my choice to do so.  I told my mom that after I graduate I may just waiter for a while or work as a janitor and she was fine with this.  Does anyone feel like they've wasted so much time and don't know how to recover?

I Feel like I wasted the best time of my life (M25),"I've had a pretty tough childhood.

I had social anxiety and didn't had friends for the most of it.

My family wasn't there for me.

I never had a romantic moment, never had sex, never went on a date, never kissed any girl, never felt what is love.

I just look back at the time that passed and can't hold my tears.

I'll be 26 in July and I feel miserable.

I did made progress in my life. I look pretty decent, and overcame most of my social anxiety. But it just doesn't feel like I can be happy.

I don't have a group of friends around me.

But my biggest disappointment is that I will forever remember that I'm a loser. Even if tommorow I'll have sex, I'll always remember that it was at the age of 25.

When people look at me they won't realize that. I look good and speak with confidence.

There's always those questions about sex and love and I feel embrasssed. I feel like there was a highschool course about dating and pickup and I missed it.

I can't stop thinking about the fact that I'm close to 30 than to 18. I don't want that. I want to be a happy little kid, that doesn't think about life hardships. I wanna feel happiness, I want to feel relief.",Kauzzi,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jheduy/i_feel_like_i_wasted_the_best_time_of_my_life_m25/,pretty tough childhood social anxiety friend family never romantic moment never sex never went date never kissed girl never felt love look back time passed hold tear 26 july feel miserable made progress life look pretty decent overcame social anxiety feel like happy group friend around biggest disappointment forever remember loser even tommorow sex always remember wa age 25 people look realize look good speak confidence always question sex love feel embrasssed feel like wa highschool course dating pickup missed stop thinking fact close 30 18 want want happy little kid think life hardship wanna feel happiness want feel relief,feel like wasted best time life m25,kau zz,1162,51,kau zz pretty tough childhood social anxiety friend family never romantic moment never sex never went date never kissed girl never felt love look back time passed hold tear 26 july feel miserable made progress life look pretty decent overcame social anxiety feel like happy group friend around biggest disappointment forever remember loser even tommorow sex always remember wa age 25 people look realize look good speak confidence always question sex love feel embrasssed feel like wa highschool course dating pickup missed stop thinking fact close 30 18 want want happy little kid think life hardship wanna feel happiness want feel relief feel like wasted best time life m25
venting here because i can't tell that to anyone irl,"if someone can simply read this i will appreciate that

every day feels the same, it's not sadness anymore, just emptiness which is much much worse

i became too apathetic and resigned to even try to do anything to myself anymore or have active suicidal thoughts...

i also haven't managed to get myself to cry for the last year although i would want to everyday as i fail with almost everything (including simple things such as sleeping or eating)

for me life is just passively waiting for the day when being trapped in this half-alive state finally turns into being non-alive

can there be anything done with that as therapy failed?

as for the title... i have only a few people who i trust and they are occupied with more important things than talking with me about that and/or have even worse problems so i don't want to be a burden to them

I'm going through yet again another funk and I always forget how to get out of it. Any advice?,"- I feel depressed and anxious my breathing is so shallow my throat hurts and I feel like I'm gonna die,


- it's 5pm and I'm still in bed with ton of junk around me, this isn't me but I don't have the will to get out of bed,


- whatever I think of doing seems like a mountain, even ordering food from my phone, so i still didn't eat for the day,


- I'm not in therapy although I wish I was, but my last two therapists were unprofessional and I feel like they've traumatized me  and now I'm afraid to sign up for therapy although I need it desperately,



- I don't have any fresh food or vegetables to eat, I want to go outside for grocery shopping, to go for a run, for some fresh air but I'm scared, it's a mix of being scared to get contaminated by the virus (I have an underlying desease), mixed with social anxiety and just desperation and isolation,



- I have no one to talk to except one friend but I think I bothered her enough,



- this state may also be triggered by a job interview I have in 4 days, phd positions I wanna apply to but I feel too weak and lack self esteem to write a proper case for myself. 



- I also went and scrolled down my ex narcissistic boyfriend social profile, and just realised how his life has been going great, and he has been achieving all his goals while I'm struggling to get out of bed, 
 



It has been a roller coaster since I broke up with the narcissistic ex a year ago. All off a suden my self esteem self worth, self love plummeted and I welcomed depression and anxiety to my life. I genuinely wish I can just die, I avoid entertaining any suicidal thoughts as I don't know where my mind can take me. But I wish I can stop existing sometimes.

I’m having difficulty in finding an outlet for my negative emotions and expressing my positive ones.,"There have been countless of times wherein after I get upset, annoyed and/or etc. at something, it just ends up with me suppressing it. I’m not the type to scream out in anger or throwing things and whatnot. I don’t really have friends that I’m close or comfortable enough to talk about such things either. And whenever the source of negative emotion is a person who apologizes or makes up for it after, I also struggle t express my gratitude or happiness for what they’ve done. I have a hard time expressing my positive emotions in general. I have a fucking hard time being affectionate to my own cat in front of other people. I can be mad at myself for that but that wouldn’t solve anything. I’m a fucking mess. I don’t know what to do anymore.

How do I deal with depression?,"I've never been great at socializing. Today my close friends invited me for a weekend of partying and chilling out. I went there but freaked out even though I was going to be with my good buddies. I tried battling my issues with socializing but couldn't do it, made silly excuses and came back.

I'm now sitting up in my bed, feeling completely lonely. Don't think it's anyone else's fault, it's my own. But I feel more at peace with things right now, being all alone by myself, than I was with my friends. At the same time my future has been flashing in front of me, and it's terrifying to think I feel better suffering loneliness than with some company.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I am fucking terrified right now. I feel lonely. I feel scared about feeling better when lonely. I want to have friends in my life but I can't. I can't seem to find a way out of this.

I don't even know where to go from here. I've been dealing with depression ever since I was dumped 12 years ago (can't blame the girl, I was fucking stupid). I don't make friends easily, but now I am scared to be around the ones I do have. I just feel I don't belong at all.

I feel left out. Even at home.

A good friend helped me out back then, but being the absolute idiot that I am, we drifted apart. I don't know where to go, how to seek help, what to do.

Even music is killing me now. I can't watch movies or shows without feeling even worse. Found a stranger 12 years ago to pick me up, but I don't have her anymore.

"Therapist is moving, cant cope","My care coordinator (who has been pretty much doing a therapist's job with me for the last six months) is moving to another job. I'm devastated. I had just dropped out of uni after a suicide attempt due to abuse at uni, and the loss of my father and my gf, and was in a terrible place all summer, I've been so alone, in a big empty void for so long. Then we started to connect and i was really starting to work through stuff, and it finally felt like I had someone with me in all the darkness. Now he's being moved to another place and i have less than two weeks left with him. Since I found out, ive been unable to do my studying, just been crying in bed, unable to get up. 


I know this happens with therapy, youre supposed to have a relationship so that trust happens and you can be open so the therapy can work. But it's so painful when they leave. It happened with the uni counseller - when i dropped out, i felt like i was 'yearning' (for lack of a non weird word) for him for months. I know that in therapy you don't meet the real person, just their 'work' persona who has unconditional acceptance, but I dont know how to cope without that. I have been having major issues accepting my sexuality (I'm a lesbian), issues i still need to work through. He was a gay man so it was so easy to talk about these things that i usually cant even say out loud without crying or cringing. I don't know how i can progress without him. 


It feels like when you're a child and your best friend moves away. I feel so ridiculously sad, it's like another mini bereavement. 
I'd never been clingy or easily attached before i was bereaved last year. Now im starting to understand the attachment issues I have from childhood, and I don't know how I'll ever cope without a therapist. I feel like I need it more than air.

I'm also hiding a lot of things to my parents like bad. grades because that would drive them nuts.

When do you know it's time to give up?,"Here's my sad story out in the open. 

In Mid 20s. Have a very small friend circle, which is diminishing even more. Why? Because I have social anxiety. Always under the fear that people are silently judging me and hate having me around. Mind numbs down when have to interact more than 3 folks. Always been like this, so I'm the silent guy and people probably think of me as dumb.
At a wider circle, probably 6 people I could call as friends. Used to think I had a lot more (but people start showing their true colors sooner or later) Of six mentioned above, probably two or at max three who I believe really care about me, rest just hang around for the sake of it. Like always only one of these cared enough to wish me on my birthday. It's as if in every social connect, I have to put in more effort than the counterparty. Maybe I am that worthless!
Graduated with okayish acads, have decent qualifications. Yet somehow fate plays a cruel game on me and I'm stuck in a shitty role, at a pay lesser than 30% of what someone of my calibre would earn. Even pay doesn't matter, inspite of having requisite certifications I'm not able to get into a role I desire whereas people half my credentials are warming up there. Just because I don't have 'contacts'. Pains me on a daily basis.
Had a dynamic turn of events three years back (financial downturn, loss of a close family member, and much more). Life's been shit ever since then. Probably the time when my mental health started deteriorating. Haunts me down till date (thoughts of giving up swindle across my hind almost every other night)
No hobbies, since devoted most of my time for acads (which I truly repent now). Used to love programming once but now my depressed mind just wants to stay idle during the weekend.

Not remotely attractive and a body so slim that I could be the poster boy for a malnourished kid at Africa. So should not be a surprise when I say I never had a relationship/date (not even as much as a hug from someone from the opposite sex). Asked out a girl I had a crush on (for almost a year) this March and she refused. What hurt me more is she broke up all contact with me post it although I thought we were good friends. Have a lot of physical deficiencies and weaknesses too.

Sometimes I feel I'm really faking the depression given that there are people who have more serious problems than me (dysfunctional family, child abuse etc). Hence haven't been able to confront myself to go to a therapist yet. 

'It gets better' Well atleast that's not been my experience for the past few years. When I think that it cannot get any more worse, life's like 'Hold my beer here' and throws me into a quicksand, and I just keep on sinking even further.

What stops me from pulling the ledge?
I've got a wonderful family! My dad, mum and a younger sibling. They all care for me so much that I can't think of the consequences of me ceasing to exist would have on them. The past three years have been hard for all of us, and I don't understand how they cope up with it. They're the only thing that keeps me from entertaining the thought of calling it off. 
But I'm not sure how much long I can hold up. If not for these I would have just shut it down. But here I am stuck so that I don't hurt them.

Just venting 🌸,"I'm 24 tomorrow (and have deal with depression since 16) and feel like I'm far behind. It's not healthy to be critical of ourselves for where we 'should be' when it's up to us to decide that and much healthier to accept that we simply are where we are while reflecting on past achievements. I'm sure many reading this know how that isn't as easy or simple as it seems, far from it.

TLDR; I feel like I'm still here, wrapped in this depressing cloud, this haze- I cling on in hopes of living the life I want to yet it seems so difficult. I learnt to cope in this dark cacoon that saps my energy with help yet see no way out

I'm studying to build myself up in hopes I'll be able to get a job or at least a routine. That's proving quite difficult however. It's been a few months and still the insomnia persists despite help from my therapist. Often ot feels my efforts of self help and even external help fall in to this black void.

What has helped me is meditation. Sometimes it causes me to fall asleep and makes routine harder, other times it gives me clarity. I've tried many things. Recently quit coffee and have tried medications with no luck.

Days like today make it hard to cling on to hope. I want to, especially for my parents. I still live with them and often my depression screams 'leech' in to my mind. I try to remember I owe it to myself and those who haven't given up on me (unlike some of my therapists and past friends)  to keep going.

One thing that's on my mind is that I've accomplished a lot. I can eat regularly now, I can get out of bed, even if it takes a while, my mindset is much better and there are even things that I want to do... The main hurdle right now is that I'm not doing those things.

Do you know that feeling when you read a book and your mind blanks? Cooking, baking, guitar, streaming, studying etc. That wall of hazy emptiness appears.

It's hard to build routine when the activities that would tire me out seem impossible. When exercise hasn't helped despite it being one of the few things I'm able to stick to. That doesn't mean I'll give up. It'd be nice to have a silver lining though. Hopefully my next appointment and medication will be a step close, whatever the outcome. 

I'll end this by saying that I hope you all have a great day and halloween.

Depressed and anxious,"I am new to reddit — I’ve been browsing around for a while now, but I’ve lacked the courage to post anything. I can relate to a lot of what has been posted, and I now feel like it’s time that I share my story:

I grew up in a chaotic household (like I’m sure a lot of you have): my mother was mentally unstable given my father lacked a steady income and was constantly finding and experimenting with entrepreneurial projects that failed to provide our family with any steady source of income. My most vivid memories (when I can actually remember, which is difficult when you have MDD) are my parents fighting constantly about mortgage payments, infidelity on business trips, and lack of extended family support. My parents divorced when I was 12 — I I lived in multiple houses growing up with my mom, and my dad has been in and out of my life ever since, though he’s been more involved these past couple of years (I actually lived on his couch from 25 to 26).

However, fortunately, I was able to push through (or ignore)a lot of these family problems growing up, though I was still considered weird by a lot of people my age. I was an excellent high school student: I graduated with a 4.2 gpa and played two sports in which I was a captain for one them senior year. I went on to an elite private college on the east coast in which I played a varsity sport for 4 years. I had an amazing gf who I loved very much (we were together for 4 years in college, and one year after). I was confident and genuinely believed in myself: I didn’t have a fake belief in myself, but a deep love and care for myself. I graduated with a solid gpa as well as a couple of awards for both sports and academics.

After I graduated, my life spiraled out of control: I became deeply, deeply depressed and started to hate my self, a hatred so deep words cannot describe how I felt. I was stuck at a job that meant nothing to me, and spent my weekends indulging in alcohol and marijuana (my brain doesn’t react well to either of those substances). Each day I started to feel more and more “out of it”, emotionally numb, and dysphoric: I felt nothing, there was nothing to live for, and I stopped enjoying everything that used to bring me meaning and joy. I quit my job after 7 months, and I moved back home, leaving behind everything that I worked hard for: a job, friends that respected me, and a loving gf. 

After moving back, I was EXTREMELY heart broken after leaving my ex: I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t able to be the rock and support system for her anymore, I couldn’t understand why I felt so emotionally numb, and I couldn’t understand why there wasn’t any intimacy or passion in the sex or relationship anymore. I started to question my entire existence and identity, and I fell into the darkest depression a person could fall into: I literally questioned everything — I didn’t know my name, my gender, where I was born, my sexual orientation. Nothing felt real — I couldn’t tell real memories from fake memories. I had no sense of self which was slowly destroying me. 

Fast forward a year - I was living at home, unemployed and miserable. I ended up taking the GRE and applied to a graduate program at an Ivy League school. Got in, did that, but I still hated my self the whole time (depression, dysphoria, anxiety) it was just that I was able to hide it and distract myself in academics.

After getting my grad degree, I moved home, and I failed to keep in contact with everyone I met in school. Again, the cycle continued: depressed, dysphoric, unemployed, anxious, living at home, and lonely. I couldn’t figure out how to hold on to a job or even find one; I just wanted to go back to school again for the third time, take out more loans, and become further in debt. I stopped caring completely, about everything.

I started to watch porn, have sex with random girls to boost my self esteem (it never did) and drink heavily, and I also got into COCAINE, which completely destroyed me: I felt worthless and lost before, oh boy did cocaine just absolutely fuck me up. My delusions and dysphoria started to worsen: my life goal was to become a cocaine dealer in Mexico (started looking at plane tickets) or a lady boy in Thailand. My entire sex drive was in ruins: I had nothing solid to hold onto, again, a very fragile self image around who I was as human being with very intense dysphoria. For example, I would have repeated videos in my brain of being raped over and over again: I genuinely believed I was a victim of childhood rape, but there is no evidence of that. I went on a cocaine and alcohol binge one night, and the only thing I remember is the next morning being driven to the emergency room: I had gotten the shit beat out of me at the bar, been handcuffed  by the cops, driven home by them, and started threatening to kill myself as well as my entire family. At the emergency room, I had an insanely high blood alcohol content as well as cocaine in my system (even the day after). I talked to the social worker/psychologist there, and he determined that I was suicidal and delusional, so he put me in the schizophrenic unit of the psych ward for three days, but after the first day I was moved to the major depression and anxiety unit as they believed that was a better fit. 

I got out after 4 or 5 days, and I went to see a mental health professional voluntarily for the first time since I was a child: I saw a psychologist when I was young, but that was it. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic features, and I was prescribed Abilify and Lexapro. I had been taking both for about a year and a half; however, I went cold turkey on the Lexapro two or three weeks ago and tapered off the Abilify myself a month and a half ago: I just couldn’t stand the weight gain ( I probably gained 50 lbs) and it really didn’t make me feel at peace with myself, it was a bandaid, and I genuinely knew that from the bottom of my heart.

Moved back to the Ivy League town where I graduated from, and I was able to find a job doing consulting work (think about one of those jobs that only rich connected people get); but I quit after 8 months because I wanted to become a professional poker player. I moved to Las Vegas, got an apartment, and started playing at the casinos. Covid happened, I lost my money, and moved back home again. Again, cycle repeats itself. 

I recently found a job in another state doing bullshit office work: think Dilbert or Office Space. But, I have come to terms with it, and I’m doing my best to find joy in the little things. I have completely quit alcohol: it’s not even an option. I’m done with it, forever. Drugs and alcohol absolutely crush me. 

I still have intense bouts of crippling depression and anxiety attacks which I’ve come to realize are fueled by my inability to understand who I am or hold onto any sort of solid self image of myself at the deepest level: this prevents me from seeking out genuine relationships with other people, whether that be friends or a significant other. I am still questioning all aspects of my self: Am I straight or gay? Am I male or female? Where am I from? What is my name? Who are my family members? Memories don’t seem real, nothing seems real anymore. It’s wearing me down, and I can’t imagine that a person could go through so much pain and still exist. It’s a miracle.

I’m seeing a new psychiatrist, and I am hopeful he will help. I’ve been stable before, relatively content and at peace with myself; I am hoping to get back to that place again. I can’t give up.

Thanks for reading.

Take a break from friends because I’m annoying?,"I have two friends and they’re my only friends. Don’t have much of a family so they’re my shoulders to cry on between therapy sessions (which are every other month because it’s expensive).

Problem is I’ve been crying in their shoulders all year so far. In our group chat, there’s always something going wrong or something I need guidance for. And then the chat goes into a discord as they’re trying to be upbeat and supportive and I question their points or have some sort of rebuttal. It’s a mess.

I want to give them a break. I usually say I’m going to go quiet for a week and they’ve occasionally argued that I don’t need to do that but, idk. I always feel guilty. A chat between them would be so sweet and friendly and then I step in with questions about how to get my life together and how hard that is to do. 

Should I cut them some slack and take a break?

"27 - depressed, anxious, dysphoric","I am new to reddit — I’ve been browsing around for a while now, but I’ve lacked the courage to post anything. I can relate to a lot of what has been posted, and I now feel like it’s time that I share my story:

I grew up in a chaotic household (like I’m sure a lot of you have): my mother was relatively mentally unstable given my father lacked a steady income and was constantly finding and experimenting with entrepreneurial projects that failed to provide our family with any steady source of income. My most vivid memories (when I can actually remember, which is difficult when you have MDD) are my parents fighting constantly about mortgage payments, infidelity on business trips, and lack of extended family support. My parents divorced when I was 12 — I lived in multiple houses growing up with my mom, and my dad has been in and out of my life ever since, though he’s been more involved these past couple of years (I actually lived on his couch from ages 25 to 26).

However, fortunately, I was able to push through (or ignore)a lot of these family problems growing up, though I was still considered weird by a lot of people my age. I was an excellent high school student: I graduated with a 4.2 gpa and played two sports in which I was a captain for one them senior year. I went on to an elite private college on the east coast in which I played a varsity sport for 4 years. I had an amazing gf who I loved very much (we were together for 4 years in college, and one year after). I was confident and genuinely believed in myself: not a fake belief, but a deep love and care for myself. I graduated with a solid gpa as well as a couple of awards for both sports and academics.

After I graduated, my life spiraled out of control: I became deeply, deeply depressed and started to hate my self, a hatred so deep words cannot describe. I was stuck at a job that meant nothing to me, and spent my weekends indulging in alcohol and marijuana (my brain doesn’t react well to either of those substances). Each day I started to feel more and more “out of it”, emotionally numb, and dysphoric: I felt nothing, there was nothing to live for, and I stopped enjoying everything that used to bring me meaning and joy. I quit my job after 7 months, and I moved back home, leaving behind everything that I worked hard for: a job, friends that respected me, and a loving gf. 

After moving back, I was EXTREMELY heart broken after leaving my ex: I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t able to be the rock and support system for her anymore, I couldn’t understand why I felt so emotionally numb, and I couldn’t understand why there wasn’t any intimacy or passion in the sex or relationship anymore. I started to question my entire existence and identity, and I fell into the darkest depression a person could fall into: I literally questioned everything — I didn’t know my name, my gender, where I was born, my sexual orientation. Nothing felt real — I couldn’t tell real memories from fake memories. There was no sense of self which was slowly destroying me. 

Fast forward a year - I was living at home, unemployed and miserable. I ended up taking the GRE and applied to a graduate program at an Ivy League school. Got in, did that, but I still hated my self the whole time (depression, dysphoria, anxiety) it was just that I was able to hide it and distract myself in academics.

After getting my grad degree, I moved home, and I failed to keep in contact with everyone I met in school. Again, the cycle continued: depressed, dysphoric, unemployed, anxious, living at home, and lonely. I couldn’t figure out how to hold on to a job or even find one; I just wanted to go back to school again for the third time, take out more loans, and become further in debt. I stopped caring completely, about everything.

I started to watch porn, have sex with random girls to boost my self esteem (it never did) and drink heavily, and I also got into COCAINE, which completely destroyed me: I felt worthless and lost before, oh boy did cocaine just absolutely fuck me up. My delusions and dysphoria started to worsen: my life goal was to become a cocaine dealer in Mexico (started looking at plane tickets) or a lady boy in Thailand.

I'll be easy with myself today yet I'll still keep up.,"I‘ve had a very motivated week so far because of an ultimate my SO gave me. I've been very scared of the outcome if he decides to leave me. But I just feel so lazy today, and maybe scared of doing one project/task that's entirely overwhelming to me. I should probably also mention that I struggle with pretty severe ADHD even as an adult.

Just a rant about demotivation I guess,"I don’t know if I can even explain this properly, and apologies in advance if this post is all over the place but while I’m at work if something needs to get done I can just do it. Entire floor moves and display changes that take 6+ hours? No problem,I just plow through it. The issue comes when I’m back at home. My room is an absolute disaster, I never want to cook for myself, and I spend literally all of my time off either sleeping or watching a streaming service. I know my room needs to be cleaned, but I can’t. 

I almost feel like maybe it’s because realistically there’s no reason for me to clean my room or cook food? I can just order food basically any time, no one’s going to yell at me if my room isn’t done and the only person affected really is me. But at the same time it feels so gross whenever I’m in there and I wish it was clean if that makes sense? 

It makes me want to scream it’s so annoying and I just had to tell someone because it feels like whenever I tell people in my personal life they don’t get it at all and they’re just like “well just do whatever you do at work” but I DONT KNOW what I’m doing differently!!",MintyBeanBurrito,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhcvkd/just_a_rant_about_demotivation_i_guess/,know even explain properly apology advance post place work something need get done entire floor move display change take 6 hour problem plow issue come back home room absolute disaster never want cook spend literally time either sleeping watching streaming service know room need cleaned almost feel like maybe realistically reason clean room cook food order food basically time one going yell room done person affected really time feel gross whenever wish wa clean make sense make want scream annoying tell someone feel like whenever tell people personal life get like well whatever work dont know differently,rant demotivation guess,minty bean burrito,1143,38,minty bean burrito know even explain properly apology advance post place work something need get done entire floor move display change take 6 hour problem plow issue come back home room absolute disaster never want cook spend literally time either sleeping watching streaming service know room need cleaned almost feel like maybe realistically reason clean room cook food order food basically time one going yell room done person affected really time feel gross whenever wish wa clean make sense make want scream annoying tell someone feel like whenever tell people personal life get like well whatever work dont know differently rant demotivation guess

How to regain my appetite and energy ... the strong friend has been drained.,"TLDR: Are there any supplements that will help with my appetite and energy?

I feel so drained and im mentally, emotionally and physically hurting. My body physically hurts especially my chest and stomach and I don't have heart problems I know it's stress. I have no support and I have a teenager so I need my appetite and energy. 2019 - NOW has been hell and the hits keep coming. I feel broken but only in few pieces not shattered. I feel like one day I will say this experience has been like a Japanese Kintsugi project and I've recovered better than I was before. 

I've surrounded myself with energy vampires and they've finally drained me dry and I'm on my last Mario life. My toxic upbringing taught me to give support and except all the reasons why others can't give it. My OCD  and constant need to be good enough for everyone turned me into a fixer, emotional supporter, ms i got ur back, super mom, corporate climber and obsessive worrier.

I now know expecting support from friends and a romantic partner is a requirement and not an option but I'm too drained to go out and meet people. I'm not strong. My mental health is just as important as everyone elses. Just because I smile and try to fix it doesn't mean I can do it on my own. Yes I ask for support. No I don't get it. I need what I give to others, that I thought was ok to not receive because they weren't capable because I'm an empath. I'm not an empath! That belief is fucking toxic and I wish people would stop pushing that toxic trash on the ""strong friend"". I'm NOT STRONG, I JUST CARE! I WAS EXHAUSTED WHEN YOU ALL THOUGHT I WAS STRONG!

I was just released from a toxic roller coaster and I don't have the energy to date. I need to make more professional female friends but I'd actually have to leave the house for that. My daughter needs to get her license in 30 days and we have no support from her father's family so I have to get out of bed but she can be draining as well. 

Are there any supplements that will help with my appetite and energy? Bromelain helps with my appetite but makes me tired and gives me insane sleep paralysis and nightmares. 

Been on 12.5 mg of zoloft for 3 days now and increasing to 25mg tonight but it gives me a pounding headache and makes me numb and brings on mini panic attacks and crying fits at night when tapering off.

I've HAD ENOUGH,"my mother continuously triggers my mental health. It's clear as day that she has a favourite (my brother) and I can't stand it any longer. I just finished having a panic attack over an altercation I had with her. 
my brother just bought a house so he'll be moving out with his gf soon, but whenever he's around I get treated like the black sheep. I'm sick and tired of it, as if this year hasn't been difficult already, work being stressful and I have to deal with feeling mistreated in my own home. the only time shes genuinely interested in anything about me is when it's just me and her together. I've actually questioned her about it and she can never answer me, nor does she deny it. I'm saving up every penny I can get to be able to move out with my partner (we're both 23) and as soon as I'm able to, I'm out of here. 
I pay rent, help out with bills ect, but I'm barely at home. what's the point.

I need of love but not getting it,"For a long time, I have this feeling that I need someone who will hug me and be there for me, whom I trust completely. But I never got it. 23y old and not one was like in love with me. I get really depressed about it and I recently got diagnosed with somewhere in between of 'Medium depressive episode' to 'Medium depressive disorder.'

So about two weeks ago, I had to say goodbye to a friend. At the moment I realised he never was und never will be there for me because I am a hassle for him.

Just hours ago, I saw a good friend of mine with his new boyfriend and they were cute and so lovable.

And now, now I am spiraling down the coaster of ""I really must be unlovable. Sth is up with me that noone has like the slightest loving affection for me.""

I always thought of myself as a good guy. I am loving and cheerish; I want my loved one to do their best; I am here for them, when they're down. Yes, I am stubbern, have strong opinions and discussions with me are hard. I know I can hold a grudge. However, I know that not every argument is personal and that you move on at some point. That's part of being an adult.

But obviously I have a picture of myself that is a single lie. I am unlovable, unlikable.

I am sick of being alone and lonely. I tried taking initiative, opening myself to others, but noone is interested in me, so I loathe from waking up to going to bed every day. Why in the hell should I not go super autodestruction-mode right now?

I’m not better,"I’m 18 years old. A few years ago I realized I was depressed and I thought not was the worst thing that could ever happen to me. A lot of it was caused by my best friend who is now my ex girlfriend. She manipulated me and made me feel like I was worthless and constantly made fun of me and told me I acted like a 5 year old and that I needed to leave my family because they didn’t know what was best for me. She talked me into doing things I didn’t exactly want to do. I spent all my time outside of school in my bed either crying or talking to her on the phone. I tried to kill myself 7 times and nobody ever knew. I went to therapy a few times and I miraculously thought I was “better”. I didn’t feel sad anymore and I started to do things that I liked to do again. About a year passed where I thought that I was no longer depressed. Then a week ago I played an online game called Doki Doki Literature Club. One of the characters in the game, Sayori, is depressed. She describes her depression in depth, and I realized that it was exactly how I felt. The more I thought about it, I realized that while I didn’t feel depressed anymore, I wasn’t happy either. I feel like my emotions are gone. I am unable to cry no matter what happens or what I do. My face will feel like I’m crying and I will actually sob, but no tears come out. I just wail. I’m so frustrated. I’ve started to cut myself because that’s at least a feeling. I just want so bad to have my feelings again.  I feel like I’m not actually here. I wrote this to describe what I’m feeling. 

I feel like I am someone that I am not

I want to go home

I want my head back

I want my mind back

Please let me feel something

I feel nothing 

I am not happy

I am not sad

Where am I

I long for the days I was depressed 

I long for the days when I wished I was dead

At least I felt something

Something is better than nothing

At least I could cry

I wish I could cry

Please let me cry

Please let me feel something

I hope the cuts help

They need to be deeper

I need to hurt

I need to feel pain

At least I can make myself feel pain

I want to be in control

Let me back in

I want to be me again

Please

I want to want to die

„I Am Happy“,"Today was good. I was biking home from work, and as I was biking, I was thinking about my life and why I have been so bad at it. I have improved a lot, but I know there is still much more. 

But then after starting to worry again, I tried something. I said intentionally in my head: „I am happy.“ Now, I know what you’re thinking. Because I thought the same before trying. „Leave me alone with that positive affirmative thinking. I will only say that if I’m happy already anyway.“ But I realized that thinking that way never got me anywhere, so I finally submitted and tried to open up to the world so it could help me. 

And for a brief moment, I did feel happy. It actually worked. I felt the same feeling like I felt when I was a child. Curious, loving, in love with life and people. I said it again and again, just in my head. „I am happy.“ For a tiny moment, I felt like my old young self again. It was like I learned the word „happy“ again for the first time and what it means. Or like I met my happy self from a parallel universe saying: Finally we get to meet again! I’ve missed you all this time. Afterwards I was so elated that I looked more at the stuff in the grocery store and bought new things I never knew existed, instead of just buying the usual. 

I know that this may sound kind of lame. But maybe when you’ve run out of alternatives you will try it too? Who would this person be that’s you and happy?",Taylina,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhg2qs/i_am_happy/,today wa good wa biking home work wa biking wa thinking life bad improved lot know still much starting worry tried something said intentionally head happy know thinking thought trying leave alone positive affirmative thinking say happy already anyway realized thinking way never got anywhere finally submitted tried open world could help brief moment feel happy actually worked felt feeling like felt wa child curious loving love life people said head happy tiny moment felt like old young self wa like learned word happy first time mean like met happy self parallel universe saying finally get meet missed time afterwards wa elated looked stuff grocery store bought new thing never knew existed instead buying usual know may sound kind lame maybe run alternative try would person happy,happy,tay lina,1420,12,tay lina today wa good wa biking home work wa biking wa thinking life bad improved lot know still much starting worry tried something said intentionally head happy know thinking thought trying leave alone positive affirmative thinking say happy already anyway realized thinking way never got anywhere finally submitted tried open world could help brief moment feel happy actually worked felt feeling like felt wa child curious loving love life people said head happy tiny moment felt like old young self wa like learned word happy first time mean like met happy self parallel universe saying finally get meet missed time afterwards wa elated looked stuff grocery store bought new thing never knew existed instead buying usual know may sound kind lame maybe run alternative try would person happy happy
Sting inside tonight,"Never spoke to anyone online before. The last weeks been weird. I have become depressed and “Dependent” on a drug which is what my therapist said. But it’s ok she said we will sort it. Been feeling like it for about 6 weeks and lived a stress free (normal minimum wage 9-5 job) 2 kids and married. 29 I am, I don’t like this feeling. I have absolutely no idea why it has come on now but I feel like I am dying without dying. It’s hard to explain as I have never been down this road before but I’m so bored have so much to do and WANT to do but I can’t. I don’t like this feeling. I cut myself today nothing heavy no blood. Felt a bit weird. I hope their is isn’t many people in the world that feel like this. Wish it was normal again. How said that I get excited for my 1 hour therapy session lol. My daughters are so cool and daddy’s girls. But sometimes I can’t come racing home like i used to so I can see my 10 month old and pick her up high. I just can’t feel “happy” and it’s so insane I literally don’t know why. My wife’s supportive, she’s cool with it. Maybe it’s trauma from about 14+. Or maybe being an adult is just harder than I thought.  I don’t even really think I went through trauma as a kid. God nose why I hope, or someone. If anyone else feels like this just hold on out I guess. I like a walk if I can get myself to do it. Or pace around my house for 3 hours lol.

Being human is so strange,"We are literally born, with a consciousness
Where we dont even get the answer why, or how. We just have to figure it out ourselves. Whether its god, big bang or science. And we are not even asked if we want to live, or want to die. I try my best at trying to be optimistic, but damn life can bring you down. So much hate, and suffering. And i just cant seem to distract myself from it. And i dont know why. I just cant seem to change my mindset even though i really want to. Ive tried so much, to get over my depression. Like taking antidepressant. Or getting new hobbies, going out, do fitness, run, talk with friends, spending a lot of time with family. I just get this nagging feeling of despair, and dark thoughts. Because i think about how i should think, because the way im thinking is not helping, and now im thinking about thinking that im thinking. Ive tried to listen to robert sapolsky and sam harris, for some information on why i am here, and what i can do to suffer less. And ive spend so much time trying to figure out consciousness, and how the mind works. How a lot of it is genes, and we maybe dont have free will. But that meditation can help. But everytime i meditate i cant seem to stop ruminating. My brain just wants to overthink and bealive in stuff that isnt true. Damn, and there are so many loving and caring people around me, but it just dosent seem to help my depression.

friend says i dont try hard enough,"Friendship advice please

i’ve been depressed for 7-8 years now since i was very young. i’ve been clinically diagnosed with severe depression and i used to see a therapist. i used so self-harm and i tried to off myself a few times. right now i still feel like that and i picked up smoking for a bit, but i stopped as well since i didnt smoke enough to develop an addiction. i dont self-harm anymore and i haven’t tried to off myself in years now. i’ve been going through a tough time lately and i read the book “the subtle art of not giving a fuck”. in the book, the author talks about this bear that would go around telling people blunt but much needed advice. so i asked some very close friends that question since i wanted to know their honest perspective and insight. one friend talked about my mental health. she said that i need to look to the future and not the past. that she thought it was weak of me and that there are people going through so much more such as diseases and still trying. she said it made her angry and upset. and she told me i wasn’t trying and that when negative thoughts happens i should think positive thoughts to counteract it. i tried explaining to her that i was trying and that my first priority is to survive not to be happy yet and she told me this wasn’t good enough. she then said no matter what even if i keep telling her im trying my best, her answer would always be to try harder. she told me she was also going through a tough time due to her mom and when i kept talking about depression, self-harm and s***ide it made her start self-harming again too but one day she woke up and realized this isn’t the way. she said she forced herself to think positive thoughts and told me i need to do the same. honestly that talk just made me feel so much worse and i started reverting. i wanted to self harm again and i was sobbing and having a panic attack. i didnt tell her any of this because i dont want her to blame herself so i told her to talk another day. i ended up just drawing on myself as did not want to start doing my self destructive behaviour again. i dont know how to tell her she hurt me and honestly im wondering if she is right. i dont know if i want this friendship to continue as i am leaning towards no now but i dont know how to express it. sorry about mistakes and formatting i am on my phone

Lowest I’ve Been,"This year has been incredibly tough on me. I don’t see my family, my ex won’t let me see my dog. I got fired for something dumb, I’m running really low on funds to the point that I don’t know how to pay for my upcoming bills and on top of that my monthly tuition for school. Sadly the school I’m attending doesn’t accept fasfa but they do offer payment plans. But even then I don’t know how to pay for it at the moment. 


Thankfully a friend helped me get hired at a place she working at, but I don’t start until next week, so I won’t have a check for another 2-3 weeks.

My father has been sending me money to help me out but there’s only so much he can do. And my girlfriend helped me out too by helping get out of my overdraft fees on my bank account. But I feel shitty for her doing that.

She said it’s okay and to simply pay her back with a date or something when I can, but I hate that it came to her having to give me the money that she worked hard for.

Watching myself slipping away into depression,"I am someone who is considered successful by society in most senses. I have a good job and am very wealthy for someone in their mid-20's. I live frugally, but I have a nice house and car. I have no debt. But I'm completely depressed. I'm coming to realize that I've been in this state on-and-off for a while, maybe forever. It used to just be a social thing. I never developed the best social skills, and I was an outcast throughout middle school and high school. I was bullied a lot. I had no real friends in high school until my junior year; none in middle school. I fit in better in college, but I still chose to remove myself from the mainstream and spend more time alone. I started smoking weed in college the summer after my Freshman year, and I've been a daily smoker pretty much ever since. Now, years later, I am watching my high-functioning self slip away as I become more depressed. I can't focus on work anymore, or anything really (even TV shows, movies, or articles), and it's a daily struggle to find motivation even to do things I used to love (and still do I guess), like spending time outdoors. I moved to a new town about 6 months ago where I didn't know anyone, and haven't really made any friends; I get some support from my parents, but that's about it, and I am not very forthcoming with them. I feel guilty; I know they have plenty going on in their lives, and they can't help me from thousands of miles away, so I don't ask for too much help, though they do know what's going on with me at a high level. I know I have to quit smoking, that can't possibly be helping my mood or motivation, but I'm afraid of what will happen from there; part of me thinks that once I quit, I'll just be forced to dealing with whatever underlying feelings had me depressed before I ever started smoking.

I know I'm not the only person who feels this way. But is there a path out? I really just want to feel normal again.",No_Acanthaceae_4619,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jhfoyp/watching_myself_slipping_away_into_depression/,someone considered successful society sens good job wealthy someone mid 20 live frugally nice house car debt completely depressed coming realize state maybe forever used social thing never developed best social skill wa outcast throughout middle school high school wa bullied lot real friend high school junior year none middle school fit better college still chose remove mainstream spend time alone started smoking weed college summer freshman year daily smoker pretty much ever since year later watching high functioning self slip away become depressed focus work anymore anything really even tv show movie article daily struggle find motivation even thing used love still guess like spending time outdoors moved new town 6 month ago know anyone really made friend get support parent forthcoming feel guilty know plenty going life help thousand mile away ask much help though know going high level know quit smoking possibly helping mood motivation afraid happen part think quit forced dealing whatever underlying feeling depressed ever started smoking know person feel way path really want feel normal,watching slipping away depression,acanthaceae 4619,1927,45,acanthaceae 4619 someone considered successful society sens good job wealthy someone mid 20 live frugally nice house car debt completely depressed coming realize state maybe forever used social thing never developed best social skill wa outcast throughout middle school high school wa bullied lot real friend high school junior year none middle school fit better college still chose remove mainstream spend time alone started smoking weed college summer freshman year daily smoker pretty much ever since year later watching high functioning self slip away become depressed focus work anymore anything really even tv show movie article daily struggle find motivation even thing used love still guess like spending time outdoors moved new town 6 month ago know anyone really made friend get support parent forthcoming feel guilty know plenty going life help thousand mile away ask much help though know going high level know quit smoking possibly helping mood motivation afraid happen part think quit forced dealing whatever underlying feeling depressed ever started smoking know person feel way path really want feel normal watching slipping away depression

I know it sounds stupid to try ending your life because of exams, but my parents have raised me to base my worth on grades and with my depression (and most likely undiagnosed ADHD) everything has been slipping from my grasp and I feel as though there's nothing worth living for anymore.

It gets better????,"I think for some people it probably does get better, and I’m genuinely happy for them. But I can’t help but feel like that’s a pretty ridiculous blanket statement that unfortunately doesn’t apply to everyone. I’m 26 now, in retrospect I’ve been depressed to some extent since at least age 13, and it just doesn’t get better. For some people depression isn’t going to just magically go away someday. For some of us therapy and medication just isn’t enough to suddenly make us fully functioning people. My life will forever be filled with insecurity and self doubt, that is the way my brain works and no drug I take or alternative thinking  pattern is going to change that. Sorry if that sounds too negative, but I’m the one who has been living this life for 26 years. I am the one who knows my brain and I know that it is the brain I am stuck with. I’ve tried to change countless times and it gets me nowhere. I always end up running into roadblocks and being paralyzed by anxiety and fear. I don’t know. I just think for some of us the depression and/or anxiety is too strong to totally conquer.

I got dream cuddles and it was really nice but now I'm sad again,"I've been having a really rough time recently trying to get over someone that doesn't seem to want to be a big part of my life anymore.

Last night I had this really long dream where I was spending time with this girl (random girl, not anyone from real life) that was staying with me and at one point she just laid down on me and hugged me really tight. And I remember very vividly that I put her arms around her and hugged her tighter and then she hugged me tighter. And we just laid that way for a bit and it was really really really nice. It felt so real and in that moment I felt happy and cared for.

And for some reason that is just sticking with me so hard right now. I need that right now - someone to hold. It was really nice at the time but now it's making my loneliness worse.

"Guy (37m) makes me (24f) feel horrible, is it my fault?"," Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I'll try to recount everything from my perspective, I would really appreciate some honest answers on this as I've been desperately trying to wrap my brain around it.

So I meet this man, and for the first month its a whirlwind of dating (lunches, dinners, sleepovers, hiking, etc.) and sex. Lots of really great sex. Everything is fine til the last few times we see each other.

List of incidents:

\-For context, we've seen each other at least 10 times prior to all of this. One time he snapped at me for hugging him one morning, saying I was needy like his dog and was stressing him out so much. This was without any warning, but of course I stepped back and respected that boundary.

\-He gave me chlamydia, and disappearing for a week until *I* asked how *he* was. When I confronted him about not checking up on me, he said he felt really embarrassed.

\-The second to last time we saw each other he immediately started saying my 'anxiety' was stressing him out and making him react in a very negative way. I felt super calm with him, so again, I was confused. He later apologized and said he was cranky and overtired. Then after this I saw him last night, we had great sex and conversation, and started opening up a bit more. We had a ton of banter which I guess made him reach a breaking point. We were on the couch holding hands and he suddenly gets up and starts raising his voice saying I'm stressing him out so much and he needs to take me home, and 'how many times he needs to bash \[my\] head in before I realize that enough is enough' (mind you he has NOT gotten physically violent with me). He proceeds to take me home with music blasting and at a very high speed. We get to my house and he apologizes for raising his voice while still raising it, and I apologize for joking with him so much and realized how much that could have upset him. As he usually does, he then belittled my interpersonal skills and said I have zero emotional intelligence and don't know how to interact with people or my limits and that I have 'so much to learn'. I bring up the times he's made me feel really low and he got even more upset saying I'm just doing tit for tat. Then he said he needed to go home and get a pain killer and how he can't imagine this would ever progress.

I think what worries me the most is that the times he blew up there was zero warning sign and zero communication beforehand, he just suddenly starts raising his voice and accusing me of having really bad energy and making him feel uncomfortable. Is this my fault? Or is this just a sick power dynamic? And am I right in feeling confused or do I just keep messing up?

She was talking to my aunt about me and then my aunt said “shh she might hear you”. My mom just said “no she won’t, she’s got her earphones in”. I started getting really upset and I just came up to my room and got under the covers and started crying. I’ve tried to do my best to help my mom out whenever I can. I get student loans because my parents are separated and I live with my mom and she doesn’t work so our income is low.

How do I explain my mum?,"Hello!
I got diagnosed with major depression and some other things almost two months ago after struggling for years and finally deciding to get professional help.

My mother knows about this and knows about my struggles. When I'm home (which I am most of the time because of corona and because of depression) I'm usually not smiling.
In the evenings I like to talk with some friends on Discord and play video games with them which makes me talk more and laugh a lot.

Today my mum asked me 'where my depression is because I'm laughing a lot when talking to friends '.
I told her already that the combination of talking to friends and video games makes me happier and it distracts me from thinking and feeling like shit because my friends talk a lot.
However she doesn't understand that doing other things like cleaning my room doesn't distract me because I'm alone and overthinking. I have the feeling that she expects me to laugh and smile while cleaning my room which won't happen because I feel really bad whenever I'm alone with my thoughts.

How do I explain to her that just because I'm depressed I'm also allowed or able to sometimes smile or laugh?

I can't enjoy anything anymore,"I (22f) don't know what to do. I will explain the situation, and I hope someone can sugest something that maybe can help. 

First of all, sorry for my english, it's not my main language. I've been dealing with depression for the most part of my life, because my life was shit (I won't get into deatails). But now I don't have a really bad life, I have food and a roof over my head, my mother and my cat love me, and I don't have to work, I go to college. I'm studying law (I hate it) but I don't know what else to study because I don't like anything and I don't want to do anything. I feel like I don't have a purpose. Anyway I want to finish studying and just go to work and that's it. I accept it.

The problem is that I can't enjoy anything. I stay almost everyday in bed, sometimes reading, sometimes just looking at the phone. I can't seem to find the energy to get up and do things, because I don't want to do anything. Sometimes I force myself to get up and whatch a movie or play some game, or hang out with friends, but I don't feel good doing it, I'm bored and sad and I just want the day to finish. When I'm out I just want to go home, but when I'm home I feel sad and bored and I just don't want to be here or anywere. I know life is not perfect, but I just want to at least do things that I like, enjoy mu free time, I don't know. I don't feel good doing anything. I've been having again suicide thoughts (I've been having them my whole life, they just come and dissapear and then come again even though my life is okay now). 

I'm going to a psychologist but it's not helping, I have taken anti depressants but they didn't helped either. I'm not taking any medication right now. I don't know what to do. I hate to be in bed all day losing time and doing nothing, but when I force myself to do something I still don't enjoy it and I feel sad and bad and bored and sometimes angry and want to hurt myself. Maybe it's because I don't have a purpose in life, but I don't know hos to hace that, I've been thinking a lot every day about something that would make me feel okay but I just can't find it.

"The Source of my constant depression: I have finally figured it out, but I have no idea what to do..","When i was younger, at the start of my 9th grade winter, I started getting into Call of Duty. I noticed my skill level was above others on the game so I continued playing the game, day in and day out. After volleyballl practice, I would come home turn on my xbox and tv just play all night. Just like my 9th grade self, I see myself doing this today.

Here’s my worry. I can’t recall a moment in my life before my ex that is struggled with my self identity. what should i do now? what have I become? Am I doing the right thing with my time? I was confident with my potential with school work and school. Al i worried about was my video games and home work. At the time when my ex and I broke up, I turned to video games as my support outlet to the pain i was going thru. Here’s the twist: in years of blaming myself for playing video games, blaming myself and the prior relationship that i had as the reason on why i have this addiction; I have came to realize this addiction, these actions (e.g. Drugs, Alcohol, sexual, etc.) all were derived before my ex came into my life. She sort was the blockage to that, My life was eventful with her, sort of giving me the bandage to my issue of find my self worth. 

So now I’m stuck..... what do I do with this information? You are now doing what you used to do before you met my ex..  I have a clear memory of the day she came over to my new apartment. I was playing fortnite as she was sitting there next to me and i told her “Yeah I’m getting into this new game everyone else is playing, It’s pretty cool” and from that day forward, I do not remember leaving my controller for an inch of excitement somewhere else. 

I don’t find joy in reading, writing, listening to music, playing music, working out.... all of this requires more work compared to what I can easily get by turning on my ps4.

Can I prove I'm alive?,"I think I'm dead. In hell in fact. How can I prove to myself if I'm alive or dead?

I (tried?) To kill myself a few months ago, and short of  a literal miracle that means I'm dead. I remember I was in my car. I heard the gun go off. Then all I heard was my ears ringing. I use reloaded ammo and the only way this is possible is I shot one that didn't have powder in it. I had to push the bullet out of the barrel because it got stuck.. 

But I think it worked. I think this life I'm living since then, is my personalized hell. My wife left me 2 and a half years ago. Since my (attempt?) our relationship has gotten better. To the point where I know 100% she cares and wants to be with me. She's just scared to make that step. She's right there, but no matter what I do, no matter what I say, she can't come back yet. Its like every time I think she's going to, something pulls her back. I haven't been able to land a job since that night too. Every time one comes up something else out of my control happens that I can't take it or they just don't hire me. Everyone in my life except my wife only use me for what I have or what I can do for them. My own family doesn't care about me. My dad actually tried to fight me and told me I could get out of his house and he doesn't care if I'm under a bridge, just because me and my sister got into an argument.


But looking at my life as a hole, all the things happening to me, are what I would believe my hell would look like. 

And now I can't stop thinking about it. What if I was successful. What if I am in hell and this is everything I deserve. I don't deserve my wife. I don't deserve a family that cares about me.

"It's just, so, hard.","First off, I'm a long time lurker. I seek a lot of comfort in people sharing the exact same thoughts and emotions as me, as my friends and family don't understand what I'm going through at all. I don't really care if people see this post or not, it's just a way for me to get things off my chest. I try to talk to my friends about my depression, but none of them understand (and I can't blame them for that). 

TLDR: Life is in fucking shambles, don't have the effort to do anything, i've lost everything. What do you do to stay on top of your life?

I've been battling with depression for years, but I was able to function with it. I maintained a social life, maintained a good physique and healthy diet, received good grades and was able to do things. When COVID hit this year, and I was forced to be in lock down, in an apartment by myself, my demons got the best of me. It's been downhill ever since. I've lost all my muscle, I've gotten fat, I've dropped out of university, I've lost friends, I can't function. It's just so overwhelmingly hard to do anything. I'm often in bed all day, with the only thing getting me out of bed being video games, but I don't even find them that fun anymore, so I go back to bed and repeat the vicious cycle. 

I talk to a psychologist and psychiatrist, but they are so busy that appointments are often once a month or two, which is not even the bare minimum I require. On top of that, they're stupidly expensive and I can't work. I'm on the maximum dose for duloxetine and it's not working at all, I've tried about 2 other drugs and they didn't work at all. My life is quickly crumbling, often leaving me every night thinking of suicide. I know I will never act on it, because I can never let my friends and family experience that pain. My only hope of me getting better is the small hope of discovering a drug that will work for me, but who knows how long that will be. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the rare people who are still here reading this. Thank you. I seek for your advice, how can I get on top of the small things that will better my life? Such as going to the gym, going for a walk, cooking my own food, etc. I know so many things that would better my life, and I just can't do it. I don't have the energy or motivation. So many fucking people tell me to JUST do it, but they don't realise how hard it is for me to do it. I want to be healthy, I want to at least regain my status of being able to function while depressed. Please help.

I am definitely getting better.,"For about 3 weeks now I have been getting better. Not that I have haven't got any bad days, but I can handle them like how I can only assume a normal person can handle them. Even that thing that I have been told ""get over it"" it is sometimes doable and it feels surreal. Once I start looking at mental health as a physical condition of the brain, I always searched ways to get my brain working better and I will share the 2 things that helped.

1. Most important thing is enough oxygen to the brain. I am not talking about 5 min yoga or running or meditation. I am talking breathing correctly the entire day and during sleep.
2. Diet. Many things can cause allergies, inflammation, and all sorts of issues that can be really bad for the brain. I am slowly transitioning to lowcarb/carnivore diet. Also the brain really needs high quality nutrients, only found in meat.

I always hated yoga and exercise since I it made me feel good for a moment but then I was depressed as usual after awhile. I didn't realise that the breathing part was the key, and I needed to do it all day. Same with diet, when I eat what's good for me my lungs feel so much better and I breathe correctly. I am smoking still but I feel that I can quit, for the first time I have a bit of that thing confidence.

It took me about 1 week to start to think more clearly, and now at week 3 I am starting to work on some psychological problems with ease as I can make connection in my brain that I couldn't do before, and fix old connection that make no sense and are there because my brain was not functioning right.

There are imposters among myself,"(REPOST BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE SOMEONE TO READ MY STORY I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY)


There are imposters among myself

(Before you begin to read, the title was to sorta of hook you in and get some sort of laugh)

For the past 2-3ish months it has been nothing but hell for me, and the only thing I do to escape is play video games, so I got online and I was waiting for an invitation to a party filled with people who I consider friends. I waited and waited so then I said screw it I’ll join manually. I don’t usually do that because I don’t like joining parties out of nowhere because I’m afraid of them not wanting me in there. I say “hi” and got no response like usually. Then the night went on as usual. They start talking and if I talk or put my two cents in about something my brother tells me to shut up and his friends and my friends gang up on me and I get insulted about stuff I did in the past (i did nothing bad to clarify, just mistakes) then I go mute for the rest of the night until someone acknowledges me then I say “hi” then it repeats.

Now a rather more specific situation that happened 4 days ago.

I was playing Minecraft and I was acting upset about everything and about what was going to happen to me probably. (I’m also a pessimist) my friend asks me “hey what’s wrong” and then I proceed to tell what has been going on. I say “hey you still here?” To check if they are still listening. *no response* I say “hello?” *still no response* I assumed she left to go do something without telling me that she had to go do something (which no one I know does that and I mean NO ONE) ,so I assumed that she didn’t care. 

I tried to talk to another friend, but they had stuff going on too so when that happens I bury my thoughts and feelings until the issue is resolved. I was expecting for him talk to me about it because we have done it before, but I still have no clue what is going on.

That friend had helped me in the past by telling me what my friends said behind my back and from what he told me that he was crying because he felt bad for me. I didn’t want to know what they were saying because I just wanted to play video games.

To rap up the rest of it because it is 2:46 AM for me 

My friend’s blame me for stuff I didn’t do, they insult me, they don’t talk to me on Snapchat; no one responds, I’ll join to talk to them, but they try to piss me off and get a chuckle out of it.

Anyways i feel like im a jester to them, I feel like they want to push me away, and to me they’re the only friends I have and if I don’t have them with me I’ll just be lonely like I’am 95% of the day. I don’t go outside I’m doing online school because I had a choice, I don’t get invited to things, and I feel im the last person someone thinks of.

They’re all I have left to talk, relate, and share my feelings with.

They’re all I have left

I don’t know what to do anymore,"so I don’t know if anyone is going through the same thing and if you are I’d love to know how you are keeping it together during this pandemic. First of all I lost both my jobs in March due to pandemic I was on the verge of moving out and was looking forward to starting a new life. I’m in my mid 20s and my parents are struggling to keep the house. My mother was a childminder her job has been lost. My father has crippling anxiety the type where he can’t go to work without needing to come home after a hour. He hasn’t worked in 2 years.

To explain how bad my fathers anxiety is. He constantly has his phone on listening to podcasts everywhere he goes his phone is blaring he can’t put his electric cigarette down he has it in his hands 24 7 he can no longer watch tv as he thinks advertisements are annoying and it heightens his anxiety. He also can’t stay still constantly rummaging and dropping things and sniffing all the time as if he has ocd. He constantly rushes my mother and puts pressure on her to be ready when he expects it and fights with her if she doesn’t hurry up. He can’t handle family members being sick his own mother is sick but my mam does everything for her while he sits and listens to podcasts and sits in the car because he can’t handle seeing her like that. 

He won’t go to hospital appointments with his mother because he hates waiting and according to him makes his anxiety worse. There was a few times he left my mother in the car park out of spite while she was doing food shopping because she took too long and it drive him mad then I had to collect her I normally bring her instead of him because he hates waiting. When he gets into his moods he calls my mother all sorts of names like fat useless tells her to F off and it will go on for hours. He doesn’t go to the doctors the doctors won’t help him anymore because he refuses to help himself. Talking to him and trying to help him is like banging your head against a wall because he is so stubborn and doesn’t listen to nobody. My mother is very unhappy but she can’t do anything about it because she has no where to go. He sits around all day starting arguments with everyone my brother and I contribute over 400 euro to go to the mortgage which is well over a thousand but the house is in serious danger of being repossessed at this stage. 

I suggested that maybe the best thing to do would be to sell the house and he flipped out telling me to f to off and that he worked for the house and he will never leave it. He can’t afford his car or tax he is driving around with expired tax for months if he is stopped the car will be taken which means more money again. Im at a loss on what to do the rent In this country is insane and Without any job right now I don’t know what to do. When my job reopens again I was thinking of heading down the country to rent I know it’s far from my family friends and away from the norm but it’s the only way to be able to survive in this country.

New method to curb my depression:,"I am tired of the voices in my head and my inner monologue fucking with me. So I have decided to do the following in order to stop them:


1. Imma work so much and not stop until my body and my brain beg me to stop. Imma keep on studying until I have totally burnt myself out.



2. Make myself sleep deprived: this way, my brain won't have enough energy to keep up the hate on me.



3. I have already wished for god(I am an atheist so I don't reffer to any specific god) to kill me and neither send me to heaven not hell. Just trap me in the space between them so that I will torment and torchere myself for infinitely long time.

Not sure if this is how this sub usually works but I wrote this tonight and wanted to try share it and didn't know where else to put it.,"I can't even remember the last time I felt like I could trust someone enough to open up to them about how I feel. It definitely didn't help that I regretted it each time I ever did.

I was fourteen the first time I truly thought about killing myself. I can still remember looking over the edge of bridge. It wasn't high enough to do the job, but there was a rock. I thought if I dove onto the rock it'll surely knock me out. Then the river could do the rest. I mean, I wouldn't be the first person to drown in it.

It's still the first option I always think of when I consider doing it again. Jumping, not drowning. I don't think I'm brave enough to do it that way. I'd probably just pussy out and swim back to shore. But then, it's not like I was brave enough to do it by jumping either though.

Anyway, what was I talking about? Oh yea, telling someone about how I feel. Not as in telling them how I feel about them, although I'm not very good at that either. Just telling them how I feel about myself. How I feel like shit all of the time. So eventually, I don't know if it was that I finally felt as though I could trust someone enough to do it or I just that felt so lonely that I had to try.

So I had this friend. And she got it, she felt the same way all the time as well. And she told me. She told me how she felt shit, depressed, and how she wanted to kill herself and how she had already tried the year before. It didn't work, thankfully. I was the first person she told. Or at least that's what she told me. So what do you do when your best friend tell you she wants to die? Well I don't know what you would do but I can tell you what I did. I'd visit her at work on my days off. I'd go out with her anytime she did because she always ended the night in tears and I didn't want her to feel alone when that happened. And I started to message her each morning. I messaged her almost every single morning for over a year with a small comic in the hopes that it would cheer her up and maybe help her start her day off with a smile. I would call her during work if I got a message saying she was having a bad day and I would stay on the phone until she felt better. I even have messages from her saying that the only reason she's still alive is because of me. I didn't like those messages though, all I did was help. All I did was what I thought you were supposed to do when your friend tells you they need help.

So I had one week where I was feeling worse than usual. The worst thing about it was that there was no reason for it. I think that's one of the worst things about depression, it just comes back again and again even if you think you're finally getting passed it. The herpes of the brain. But anyway, I hadn't heard back from her in a few days, which wasn't altogether abnormal, sometimes life's hard enough and talking about it is even harder. But I was feeling extra shitty and I could've used someone to talk to so I tried to tell her I was  going through a hard time. After all, she had promised multiple times to be there if I ever needed help. But we've all heard that before, right?

So I told her I felt lonely. I told her that I felt so fucking alone and that I'm so god damn tired of feeling that way. And... nothing. That was the last message for almost a week. It sucked. Here I was thinking that if I had no one else surely, after everything else I would at least have her, that she would've at least messaged to see if I was okay or to try and make me feel not so completely alone. Anything would've been better than nothing.

After a few days it started to pass. Either that or I just got used to it again ad I went back to messaging her each morning with little comics or jokes. Calvin and Hobbes was always my go to but I'd always try to find to find different ones so it didn't get repetitive. And then I got a message back. It was a big one. It started off by apologising for taking so long to respond but that didn't matter. Like I said, sometimes she can take a while to message back. But then she started to explain why.

You see, not long before all this she was feeling suicidal again so I thought I needed to do something to change that. I sent her a bunch of messages telling her how she's loved and since I wasn't able to call her right then I sent her a video telling her how important she is and when these virus restrictions ease and she can finally fly home then I'm going to give her some time to catch up with her family and then I'm going to come up and we can finally catch up. Now I'll admit that I may have piled it on strong but can you blame me? I mean, she was talking about wanting to kill herself all over again. And when she told me she didn't respond for so long because when I told her that I felt alone she got scared that it meant that I liked her more than just as a friend. At first when she said that I felt disgusting. At first because everything I did backfired and I just ended up making her even more stressed when all I ever wanted to do was help make her feel good about herself.

And then I felt disgusting because after everything, after over a year of messages almost every morning, after hearing how she doesn't think she'd even still be alive if I hadn't helped her through it, after all the times she told me she'd always be there to return the favour if I ever needed it, the thought that I might see her as more than a friend was so bad that she suddenly forgot about it all. And I was left feeling utterly alone all over again.

And people wonder why I have a hard time talking about things, they wonder why I have low self confidence and why I always talk down about myself?

Maybe I'm just not used to things being any different.",usernameisstilltaken,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jh6x2z/not_sure_if_this_is_how_this_sub_usually_works/,even remember last

I feel like I am gaslighting myself and creating a system where I am compromising my work and what few relationships I have.,"Even in the action of typing it I feel at a loss. Maybe the stress of Covid caught up to me or my poor drinking habits. Maybe it is the work environment or my behavior at work. I dont have the strength to keep pushing for job apps. I'm in fantastic physical condition and keep at it, but it doesnt seem to be doing much for me. You know when you look at your contacts to hit up a friend and realize you have nobody left to hit up? Or when you go to a bar despite a fucking pandemic in the off chance to meet somebody new only to either drink yourself under the table listlessly refreshing reddit or meet that woman who thinks you are gay? I'm no longer even a Masters graduate working into something.. I'm a server with a useless degree trying to find a comfortable nest egg so I can afford my own tombstone. Natural kids are looking out of the question. I know 10x more about beer than any other coworker here besides the master brewer, but I'm still condescended to. I have zero autonomy at work because our boss is so riddled with insecurities about her glaring incompetency and I find iut that regional GM, the one ace in my sleeve to come to is equally obtuse.

I guess this is selfish but it really upsets me,"So like many of you, I'm stuck in life, I feel completely unloved, devoid of any semblance of hope, and frankly I'm just ready for the curtains to fall. Suicide is genuinely the only thing I feel will bring me reprieve. Simply put I wasn't meant for this world, and I want to go. Anger, resentment, depression, and despondency are the only things I feel with any consistency. 

The thing is, I can't help but be wracked with guilt when I consider and make preparations for my suicide. I am completely aware of the destruction this will do to others. Some I feel deserve it because of the destruction they've caused me to get to this point... like it's a fucked up way to get back at the world in some petty, unnoticeable way. People close to me in life have caused me far more trauma and pain than any enemy I've made. 

I just want to go. My life is my own and this is the decision I want to make. No one else's. I'm tired of people caring during crisis and ignoring you when you're trying to recover. I'm tired of being guilted for wanting to take this way out knowing what it does to others.

"""hobbies"" are just a temporary distraction from depression","I play a lot of basketball and skate a lot. Is Basketball fun? Is skateboarding fun? Is anything ever fun? No.
They just help distract me from work and my miserable life in general. 
It's like the ""happiness hormones"" that come into my head, just slightly numben the depression, while not being enough to make me happy even in the slightest.
I can't remember the last time I had fun, or was really happy. 
""You need to see a therapist!""
No I don't. What I need is not a therapist but some friends and a purpose in life. I can't force people to be friends with me, and I understand that nobody wants to be friends with me because I'm a piece of shit.
So what's left is a purpose in life. And isn't that just to have fun to be happy. And how do you get happy? By getting a purpose in life. Wow. It's like a snake biting it's own tail.

I'm lying to myself again,"Tl:dr sex is mediocre and I don't know why.

My parents went away for the weekend to visit my brother in college (I'm a junior for reference), i've never been caught doing anything irresponsible or illegal so they trusted me to stay by myself. I'm a lot more reckless and self destructive than they realize. I drive illegally (I only have my permit because of corona), fuck random girls every other week, and drink to the point where I'm concerned with myself. I don't complain to anyone about that tho, because its pointless and anyone who does isn't actually willing to change anything about themselves they're just taking out their frustration on their friends, distancing themselves from them. 

I'm bisexual, I think. I'm not out but I get turned on by both women and men. Now, I'm not even sure if I like men physically. I've had experiences with men, and it made me feel sick to my stomach, like disgusted. And I had the same experience last night, with my ex (girl). I've struggled with women to stay hard, I'm either really really horny and want to fuck the ever loving shit out of them, or completely numb head to toe. I can't put myself in the mood, and its fucked up a lot of hookups. Same has happened with guys, but less frequent. 

My ex is a virgin and I was one too when we dated so I was fine with taking it slow. She eventually told me she was molested as a kid, and I completely respected her wishes to not have sex until she was ready. We broke up before that could happen for other reasons, then reconnected a year later to be friends. She told me then she was ready and that I was the only person she was comfortable with. With my parents gone, I invited her to spend the night.

We had fun, went out to eat, watched tv, etc. There was a strong tension between us so I tried to break it by setting the mood and going for it. I wasn't horny, But I thought fuck it, maybe I'll get into it after we make out. I got into a semi after giving her head, had her blow me, then hard, I tried to stick it in but she was really closed off. Then instant flaccid. I could tell we both weren't into it, so we stopped. later in the night we took a shower together and tried again but it wouldn't go in. 

We went to bed after getting ice cream and in the morning I felt the same disgust.

Sex overall makes me feel disgusted with myself and I don't know why. I honestly feel better watching porn than I ever have with sex. Like the finish is better with sex but having hour long sex just feels mediocre at best.

I cannot find inspiration to live, i cannot find inspiration to do anything that made me happy before. I've started collage which interested me but then again i lost interest.

I've tried texting other girls but nothing i just don't find them interesting enough so i can keep texting them. I don't know what to do.

He was so strict, the kind that was only forged back in the 40’s. I loved that man. He was my example, my hero. Even when I did so much stupid shit as a teen and he reprimanded me, I still loved him. Even when yelled at me I still loved him. For fuck sake, my current career was inspired by him. I loved telling him about a patient I had or simply discussing medical things with him. That man gave me strength. When everyone said I was going to fail he was there. When nobody thought I was going to graduate high school he was there. He broke the whole graduation act to go hug me when I got my HS diploma, he was the only one there. When I graduated from college he was the first one to call me and to actually be happy for me. He might not have been the best of the best, nor said that he loved me all the time nor spoil me, but that man seriously care about me. And I like a complete idiot forgot that a couple days last year he was taken away from my life. All the love he gave me and I don’t even remember that date. How can I be so ungrateful. So selfish, so stupid. 

I miss him, I feel lonely and trapped without him.

I feel bored about reality,"I don't know if my friends are reading and think I'm crazy, but I have nowhere else to reveal what I've been hiding for so long.
I'm a very happy person, but over the past two years I've started to change a lot in my personality, I changed from a cheerful person who always smiles to someone who is always feeling sad. Actually, I still try to suppress it and do not want too many people to know. I go to school and laugh happily in the morning, when I come home at night I feel empty and lonely. It seems that my hobbies like photography and cooking are no longer interesting to me either. There were days when I just wanted to lie down and do nothing else..
I also can't control my words too well, sometimes it makes others uncomfortable or annoying. I have a close friend at school, she is very kind and we talk a lot and yeah I love her. I've always wanted to talk to her, simply because she's the only person I go to when I want to talk, but looks like she doesn't want to talk to me anymore.  We talked less in school, and she even turned off text message notifications for me. I think I upset her about something and I regret it, im so sorry.

I think I'll kill myself in January. Maybe the 12th.,"I've been depressed for years.  I have been trying to fix myself, to improve, but I'm pretty sure I don't have it in me to improve.  I have had every opportunity afforded to me.  I have no excuses for my mental shortcomings, or for my character flaws in general.  This is the most comfortable I've gotten with my own death before.

For a long time I was too afraid to end my life even though I wanted it ended.  But now I have found a method I think I can manage.  I don't want to put my family or friends through grief, but continuing to live as a failure, leaning on others, unable to exit my spiral, would just cause drawn out annoyance/pestering/burden/hardship on the people around me. Better to just rip the bandaid off.  Face the facts, own up to the eventuality and stop stalling. 

The planet is incredible, beautiful, a miracle.  It's almost unbelievable that life exists and that we're able to be conscious of the experience.  The fact that I struggle every day to find a purpose to get out of bed, to kick my butt into gear and work as hard as everyone else, to make the sacrifices and commitments it takes to support myself.  That shows I don't belong here.  I don't deserve this, I haven't earned it.

Three months ago I met someone.  We started seeing each other, we were mutually attracted, we get along well, we've been getting more and more connected.  And even though when I'm with them I just want to feel held, happy, and heard, instead I am constantly intruded with reminders that this person only likes me because I've been putting up all my good sides.  They don't know how much rot and stench is beneath the facade.  They don't know how utterly unable I am to be a stable, reliable, supportive partner.  It breaks my heart now when I'm with this person.  I have decided just to savor each moment I'm able to be with them as if it will be the last, because the last isn't far off.  I've already intentionally avoided letting things get more serious or committed because I know I ought to taper things off and explain I can't be who they want me to be.  I wouldn't keep stringing them along with false promises while I'm aware of the expiration date.

I am not in financial ruin, and that's basically the only thing keeping me from exiting sooner.  I am only taking from my savings, I know I'm not able to add to them.  But even though I know where I'm headed, so long as I am using up my own savings I feel like I can justifiably stick around.  So long as I have some money to pay rent and feed myself, I feel like I can be here a little longer.  Once I can't do that, there is no way I could live with myself relying completely on family/others for a roof over my head, food, etc.  That's just unacceptable.  I am so far past the point where those things are my responsibility.  So, after going through the holidays one last time, when it comes to january and there's yet again nothing to look forward to, I think that would be the time to go.  

My parents will be really devastated.  They put in so much of their lives, their energy, their resources to raising me.  only for me to end up a complete failure who can't produce valuable effort and bring in resources for myself or the family.  It's not fair to them at all.  My siblings will also probably be really sad, though not as much as my parents.  I think after a year or so they will be able to go about life more or less normally.  They are already in great financial standing, so there's no way it would push them over the edge of being able to live comfortably.  

I really have no idea if my friends will be hit with grief.  I don't have many.  Being so bad at caring about myself, I never made for a very good friend myself, so I don't blame them for not sticking around.  Why should they?  

None of my exes will be bothered much.  The one that accurately told me I needed help and should see a therapist already knows they were right.

I had a lot of great times in my life.  I have lots of memories I can selectively look back on and smile.  I got to see so many amazing sunsets and wide open wilderness areas.  I have listened to so many hours and hours of music.  It might be the thing I'll miss the most.  But my hearing is starting to go anyways and I won't be able to enjoy music so much as a living person either.  I've watched great movies, read great books, sat around lovely campfires, driven along stunning vista roads.  I've eaten delicious food, smelled the most wonderful flowers and perfumes.  I've done plenty.  I've been fortunate enough to do more in my life than many people will be able to in theirs.  I don't see why I should expect more.  I know plenty of people who were killed at an early age, well before they got from life what they deserved.  I've been given plenty.  It's time for me to stop taking up space.",5twelve,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jh706z/i_think_ill_kill_myself_in_january_maybe_the_12th/,depressed year trying fix improve pretty

All emotions are valid and allowed,"Contrary to popular perception, depression is not sadness- infact it is the normalcy of sadness and pain. It is a feeling that appears like numbness but in actuality is one resisting something that they think they need to hide.

Being the youngest family member, I was always told to respect elders and not show any emotion which in their eyes was 'inappropriate'. I was told that if I scored good marks I'll be a worthy enough human and will get respect. I quietly suffered abuse at the hands of my elder sister because I thought that is what good kids do and developed chronic depression as a result.

Here I want to tell you something you may have heard for the first time- ALL EMOTIONS ARE APPROPRIATE, VALID, PERFECT AND WORTHY OF EXPRESSION. THERE IS NO 'WRONG' FEELING. I used to be ashamed of the rage I felt towards my family because I thought that it's wrong to feel like that about your own blood. But today, I decided to be UNCONDITIONALLY LOVING TOWARDS MYSELF, THE WAY A MOTHER IS TOWARDS HER CHILD. I allowed each emotion, from rage, sadness, resentment and revenge (yes all the ugly ones)  to flow through me. 

As I did that, I felt a strong feeling of connection well up within me- for the first time I FELT LIKE I MATTERED. There was nothing to hide or be ashamed about, I was deserving of better treatment and the motherly side of me totally validated that opinion. I then calmed down and began seeing the world from a much lighter perspective.

Today, do yourself a favour and be kind to yourself. If you came on this planet, you are WORTHY BY DEFAULT. Sit down with a pen and a paper and be emotionally naked with yourself, allow each and every thought and emotion to flow unabashedly from pen to paper. As you allow each emotion to wash over you like water from a sea, offering no resistance whatsoever, you will find yourself heal and rise above that emotion.",Lifeiswaitingforyou,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jh6xw5/all_emotions_are_valid_and_allowed/,contrary popular perception depression sadness infact normalcy sadness pain feeling appears like numbness actuality one resisting something think need hide youngest family member wa always told respect elder show emotion eye wa inappropriate wa told scored good mark worthy enough human get respect quietly suffered abuse hand elder sister thought good kid developed chronic depression result want tell something may heard first time emotion appropriate valid perfect worthy expression wrong feeling used ashamed rage felt towards family thought wrong feel like blood today decided unconditionally loving towards way mother towards child allowed emotion rage sadness resentment revenge yes ugly one flow felt strong feeling connection well within first time felt like mattered wa nothing hide ashamed wa deserving better treatment motherly side totally validated opinion calmed began seeing world much lighter perspective today favour kind came planet worthy default sit pen paper emotionally naked allow every thought emotion flow unabashedly pen paper allow emotion wash like water sea offering resistance whatsoever find heal rise emotion,emotion valid allowed,life waiting,1883,34,life waiting contrary popular perception depression sadness infact normalcy sadness pain feeling appears like numbness actuality one resisting something think need hide youngest family member wa always told respect elder show emotion eye wa inappropriate wa told scored good mark worthy enough human get respect quietly suffered abuse hand elder sister thought good kid developed chronic depression result want tell something may heard first time emotion appropriate valid perfect worthy expression wrong feeling used ashamed rage felt towards family thought wrong feel like blood today decided unconditionally loving towards way mother towards child allowed emotion rage sadness resentment revenge yes ugly one flow felt strong feeling connection well within first time felt like mattered wa nothing hide ashamed wa deserving better treatment motherly side totally validated opinion calmed began seeing world much lighter perspective today favour kind came planet worthy default sit pen paper emotionally naked allow every thought emotion flow unabashedly pen paper allow emotion wash like water sea offering resistance whatsoever find heal rise emotion emotion valid allowed
I'm a horrible person,"My husband and I started out swinging. We met a couple in February. The husband and I fell in love. His wife is monogamous and tried poly for a little bit by dating my husband.

We were madly in love and kept trying to make things work but still wanted to keep working on us as well. I know it's wrong. I'm not asking for sympathy. In fact I want everyone to hate me.

I just want to curl up in bed and let myself die,"I lost a very good friend yesterday.

One of the rare people I could talk to about depression and anxiety (though I talked more about the latter). I tend to keep my feelings bottled up inside and just... ignore them, but with him I was actually trying to be more open about how I feel and that blew up in my face.

Because he's depressed himself, he told me I was bringing negativity and that he doesn't have the strength to handle it right now. Which, ok, I get it. But I also can't help but feel fucking betrayed.

Traumatised to that end where even saying im traumatised feels imposterish.,"Hi. First timer here. So basically I (19F) have been reading up on mental health a lot and realised that a lot of my childhood was spent in trauma and fear of my mother.  Till now i knew it was bad but i didnt give it much thought. Now I see myself being jealous of those people who were brought up without a beating. My mother used to throw tv remotes(the old heavy ones) at my head or one time in seventh class when i got 75/90 she took my head and banged it to a wall. There was no trust. She would provide well for me but i was emotionally scarred. To top it all my grandma was a bitch too. She used to constantly tell me that I'm never gonna amount to anything at all. I think all my present problems are emerging from the years I have spent crying and thinking i was alone with nobody to understand me. even as I'm writing this i can feel the need to erase it all because it doesn't matter, people have had it way worse. I currently am suffering from anxiety, depression and maybe adhd. My mother who took me to a psych is now denying that I have any mental problems and basically told me that I'm faking it. I love my mother and our relationship has improved a lot from then but even if she's way better now doesn't mean my previous memories will go away

From paradise to hell in 1 year,"Hey everyone, I’m just here to rant cuz I’m honestly so fed up with life rn. Just a little background about me, I’m a 20 year old male and I have no history of depression nor do my family. I was honestly living the best year of my life in my freshman year of college, and I admit I probs destroyed my body from eating very unhealthy. Fast forward to October in my sophomore year, that’s when shit started to go south. One day I woke up with a burning sensation in my chest and tightness and I had no clue what it was. I freaked out but I thot this was just random and that it would go away after a couple days. However, it never did so I went to the doctor the day after and I was diagnosed with acid reflux. Long story short, after I was diagnosed with that, the following week was the worst one in my life. I was puking every day and my chest felt like someone was stepping on it constantly and I couldn’t breathe properly. Anyways, fast forward to February, I started developing a bad anxiety disorder in response to my frequent worrying about my acid reflux. I began developing tension type headaches that occurred pretty frequently, but did not bother me too much. Fast forward again now to April when quarantine started, and that’s when all hell broke loose. My anxiety started reaching to extreme levels as my headaches began to get much worse. I even started getting migraines here and there and 24/7 dizziness and extreme neck tension as well. This was probs due to bad posture and just sitting in front of a computer all day long with no exercising. But anyways, I suffered immensely the entire summer and that was the first time in my life thet I was scared to live. I didn’t wanna die but I didn’t wanna live either if that makes sense. But anyways, I gradually began to start accepting all my
Stupid health issues and my anxiety started to get better a little, and then came crashing again in September. Now it’s October, a full year of suffering from acid reflux and half a year of bad anxiety, headaches, a fucked up neck that’s always tense 24/7, occasional migraines, dizziness ALL THE TIME, and yeah big time depression too cuz all I do is think about my health and quarantine is making things 10x worse.

"14 months on meds, in the process of lowering the dosage and i feel terrible again. Venting sesh incoming","mind you i never had complete trust in meds and that they would treat me etc... Merely manage my symptoms maybe. I'm down to 5mgs of Prazepam which is an antianxiety med but eh....

So the rundown. I feel empty and demotivated. Complete lack of passion for anything ever. Sometimes (in the morning) I think, this is going to be a better day. So I guess that's one significant change. I can get out of bed, I can do house chores in a feeble attempt to feel productive, but I'm not studying properly or like I should. I feel very frustrated, especially after a whole bunch of ugly feelings have reared their heads again (like loneliness, isolation, deflated sense of self-worth, lack of self esteem, regrets, regrets, regrets).

Gosh, so many damn regrets, and envy and self pity and self loathing. It's like I'm aware that I'm a toxic person, to myself and to others, but I'm also lonely and so starved for affection and human company BUT ALSO I'm paranoid and socially inept and I drive people away with my aloofness.

People.. I'm never going to amount to anything. I am an inept adult. I lack self discipline. I am an unhappy individual. And the worst of this is, that all of this self reflection is possibly a preliminary to a rebound bout of good old depression. I've spent the last 4 years in complete anguish. I made a laughable attempt to end my life and now, while I no longer have that suicidal drive, I don't want to exist. I fear death, but I hate existing. I'm not happy. I haven't been happy or done *anything* that satisfied me and made me proud of myself in a long time. I just... ugh.

inb4 consult your psychologist: I live in a third world country. My well renowned psychologist dismisses my complaints as simple ""and so"" and ""you should get over it"" so I learned to stifle my ""complaints"" pay him of the get go and wait for him to scribble the monthly prescription of the happy pills (which don't EVEN MAKE ME HAPPY ANYMORE).

"I made the tiniest, saddest little amount of progress. Can I brag about it anyway? (tw: suicide)","I just want to head this off by saying, yes: I was posting desperate stream of conscious rambles on r/SuicideWatch 3 days ago. I'm definitely not cured. I will probably do that again soon. I don't even feel good, I still fucking hate myself, I'm still on the verge of tears for no reason, I still didn't do a good job at my job today and I deserve to be fired, I still was an absentee friend and relative to everyone I love, my house is still a mess. But I'm trying so goddamn hard and I have nobody to brag about this to except here. I haven't told any of my friends or family even a little bit about how I am, they don't even know I'm depressed at all, probably lots of people assume I have anxiety because it's obvious but the depression I hide well. I haven't told my therapist how bad I am because I don't want to get 5150'd, I've been trying hard at therapy but acting like my feelings are only 65% of what they are. I probably am only able to express this kind of levity right now because I am high, a last hurrah of sorts before I take a break from weed for contraindication reasons. 

Something shifted for me today. I remember back a few months ago, when ""the shift"" from being passively suicidal to actively suicidal happened. It was a really scary moment for me. I'd been passively suicidal for years but the moment I realized it had actually become a hatching plan I intended to do soon rather than an abstract idea that I'll probably do one day, that moment slapped me in the face. I kind of just had that in reverse today?

I still hate myself. I still want to kill myself, I am still thinking about it a lot, I am still absolutely fucking miserable. I want nothing more than to not exist anymore. But something in my brain shifted back today and it once again feels like a thing I'll probably end up doing after a few more decades of suffering, not something I'm meticulously planning and researching for later this week. I don't feel an overwhelming urge to finish editing my suicide notes by a particular deadline right now.

I was so close you guys. I had been staying alive for months on the notion that my house was too messy and my affairs too out of order and it would be embarrassing to die and have my loved ones discover that I did not have my life as together as I seemed to. I understand how insane this sounds but it was a real thought process that kept me alive for months. I didn't want to disappoint them. Then a couple weeks ago, that part of me snapped too. That last defense mechanism broke, and I decided it didn't matter, the urgency I felt about needing to die outweighed the guilt for not being able to outlive my dad and the discomfort of knowing I couldn't clean up my life enough to shield my loved ones from the truth about me - that I'm mentally ill. Really that's the whole truth. I didn't do anything bad to anyone but myself, I just didn't want them to see how I've been living or the fucked up things I've been googling or the really stupid financial decisions I've been making. I wrote another note, this one I titled An Explanation. I wrote individual notes to everyone I've ever cared about, so there are a lot of them. This one was the longest one by far, and the hardest to follow, just pages and pages of me trying to explain why I feel the way I feel and trying to justify my decisions in the eyes of the people who would read it. In that note I tried to explain myself, and I explained away the messy house, the fact that I was lying and bullshitting at work and hadn't done half of what I've claimed to lately, the fact that I knew my friends would all come together and talk about me and find out that I literally haven't been talking to anyone or leaving my house -- they all thought I was busy with each other, or with work, or with other obligations. I was just busy with depression and lying to everyone, relying on the fact that my life is heavily compartmentalized so I can get away with making excuses. I didn't expect to be forgiven for any of this, I just wanted it to be explained, I hated thinking about people wasting their time wondering about me or trying to figure out what went wrong. 

And then I was ready. My things were as in order as they were going to be and I was ready. I still hesitated, but in more practical ways now, not out of fear. Did I feel bad for missing the holidays, could I try to make it til January? Maybe. Was I kind of curious to wait for the outcome of the election? Sure. Should I wait til after this heat wave, in case people don't find out for a few days, so my pet isn't stuck in my hot apartment? Yes. Would I be leaving my coworkers in a lurch if I did it this weekend rather than next? Fine, what's one more week of hell. But the point is that I had decided I was doing it soon. On bad days I drove to the bridge with only my ID, family contact information and instructions to find my notes, will, and key to my house, and an apology note to the coast guard for having to deal with my body all in a dry bag secured inside my clothes. One time I walked across and stood there gathering my thoughts for a few moments until a person came along and I worried he would talk to me so I kept moving. Other times I didn't even make it there because I was crying so hard I couldn't see where I was driving, and I didn't want to hurt anyone but myself so I would pull over. Many of my suicide attempt attempts in the last few weeks have ended sobbing in random parking lots. 

I just needed to work up a little more nerve to overcome that guilt but I couldn't seem to do that. I got so scared by the idea of someone seeing me on the bridge or a cop pulling me over for driving badly on my way there and getting 5150'd before I could do it. The thought of my friends and family finding out that I'm a disaster before I'm too dead to care about it is my worst nightmare. 

I started having more crying spells, I spend hours sobbing every single day. Every morning I wake up at 6am and sob for 3 hours before I can even think about getting out of bed and starting work. I frequently have to hold back tears in mundane conversations with people because my default state became crying.

I decided if I was going to be a little bitch about killing myself in a timely manner I should at least get this shit under control, so I made an appointment with a psychiatrist to try some pills. In the week leading up to my appointment I noticed that I was thinking about some really dark shit when I was sobbing, stuff I never thought about or could put into words when I was in an even slightly happier place. So I started making whiny voice memos and notes on my phone whenever I felt like I had an idea. Most of them were garbage but some were really insightful and things I think I should explore in therapy. When I was in a slightly more stable state I picked out all the relevant information and cleaned it up, removed the suicide stuff and the particularly dramatic depressive things so she wouldn't be suspicious and emailed it to my therapist. I've been in therapy for months, and I truly feel like we're accomplishing *something* so I stick with it, but I'm not sure what exactly we are accomplishing because I've still wanted to kill myself this whole time. But something is happening in my brain for sure, just not enough. But the point is, I was *trying* this time, and I was trying while in an unstable, acutely suicidal spiral. This was progress. Making the appointment with the psych was progress. I told my therapist about the appointment and we talked about my email and she seemed to see those things as progress too, and she said she appreciated my email because it helped her understand me more and I should keep sending more emails if I think of more things. I felt encouraged, I don't know, that's cheesy but for once I was trying really hard to get better and it felt good to have that seen. That thing that shifted, shifted back. I still want to kill myself, I still imagine it, but I don't feel a pressing need for it to happen right now. I can even almost entertain the idea of waiting a few decades for my parents to die so they don't have to live through that, which is what my plan has been for my whole life up until a few months ago.

Then this morning I had the psych appointment. I was 65% honest with my doctor in the same way as with my therapist, told him how I was feeling, right up to the line that would keep him from being concerned about anything. He prescribed an antidepressant and I'm really excited to start taking it in the morning. 

I will probably never tell my friends or family how I feel, but I got closer today than I ever have. To one friend I just expressed that I've been ""in a rut"" lately, which is more than I've ever admitted to anyone, and knowing him he's going to check in on me at some point because I said that. To another friend, one who I know has mental health issues too so would be cool about it, I casually dropped that I was starting an antidepressant. I implied it was for moderate depression or anxiety or something nonthreatening and didn't even hint that it was anywhere this severe, but still, more than I've ever told anyone. I know these tiny baby disclosures are not impressive and so many people come clean to their families and confide in them and cry together, but I'm not that kind of person and this is the best I can do. 

I know I'm only feeling better temporarily because I feel better temporarily once or twice a week most weeks. And because I'm smoking weed right now. And I understand that being passively suicidal and filled with so much self-loathing that I'm literally overflowing and will have panic attacks and crying spells throughout the day to relieve the pressure is not most people's idea of ""feeling better."" 

But I feel like the fact that I made some real moves to fix my brain while I have this slight amount of energy and clarity is an achievement. And the fact that in such a dark moment I found the presence of mind to make myself notes to look back on later, I feel like that means something, I've never done anything like that before. I don't know, I don't have and probably will never have big gains to share, and the chances that I'm going to be distraught and posting suicidal rambles again in a few days are high, but I'm starting to feel like something might be changing for me.",Snoo2821,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jh4a8w/i_made_the_tiniest_saddest_little_amount_of/,want head saying yes wa posting

Psychosomatic symptoms,"Hello Everyone,
Has anyone here made experiences with psychosomatic symptoms? I have been feeling like shit for the last couple of weeks, it all started with me not being able to breath one afternoon. It just came out of the blue, obviously I was scared and went to the doctor immediately he made some tests and send me to the hospital to diagnose further.
After a 2 day visit they told me everything was normal and that I shouldn't worry, they also referred me to a psychosomatic specialist. I have an appointment at the end of November.
My question is, has anyone made experiences with something like this? I feel like something is wrong with my body and I just can not imagine that I would get symptoms this strong just from sth like stress. I'm also just feeling weird like for example when I play video games I perform significantly worse then before and it just drives me mad. Would really help to hear from someone, who felt similar and how they overcame it.

A Missing Puzzle Piece,"I feel that this may come off as pathetic, but please understand that it took a long time and quite a bit of bravery to open up like this (I was taught from a very young age that showing any emotion, even anonymously, was a sign of weakness).

I'm 31 years of age and I was diagnosed with depression at age 15. I do not take medication regularly as I often do not have the motivation to see my therapist or psychologist to get my prescription renewed. I grew up poor and socially awkward and now I have broken free of those chains. I am by no means rich (lower class at best), but I feel that my life is great. I have a house, two cars, a wife, and a great support system. I just got a promotion at work and I'm working harder than I ever have. That having been said, I still often wonder if it would be better if I were to disappear. I often feel like the day to day life I'm living isn't mine. Almost as if the person I am is not me. I would liken my existence to being a side-character in my own life or like a bystander watching someone else live my life. I've willpower to spare and I've not given up thus far, but there is a weight I carry that I don't know how to describe with words. There is a palpable emptiness in me and every achievement I gain feels like a hollow victory. I'm missing crucial a piece of myself and I fill that space with work, social interaction, and personal missions of productive conquest but to no avail. Sometimes I feel like a void that consumes good things but constantly hungers for more. I fear that it will never be enough for me. I trudge through life unable to be proud of anything I have. Some days I will wake up, go to work, accomplish everything I set out to do, come home to my wife of 7 years (I am still madly in love with her), and have a beer before cuddling her until she falls asleep... however, once she does, I am back in the pit with nothing to distract from this all consuming void that is the missing piece of me. It feels pathetic. Would she still love me if she knew that I am constantly and consistently unhappy with everything we've built together? She knows I have depression, but would she understand that she is not enough to stop my mental illness? I don't think I deserve her and the same goes for my friends. I feel like a fraud. The person that they find so appealing is just a façade I've invented to insure that they are never worried about me. I act outwardly like a stalwart pillar of support and ray of sunshine for those around me and any weakness I show might make them lose confidence in the support that I show them. Sometimes I let a bit of my real self through and I feel ashamed for having burdened my friends with the weight of my problems. I yearn for oblivion, and yet I must always press forward. How I wish I could quit. I often hope I go to sleep and don't wake up. I've fantasized about and even planned my suicide on several occasions since I was 12, but I have not gone through with it. I am not sure whether it is because I am cowardly or because this empty piece won't let me die until I fill it with whatever it is that fits there. I'm so ashamed that I have so much that many have and would kill for, yet it isn't enough. It's almost as if my life is a long joke and I'm the punchline. I really just didn't know who to talk to about this (aside from my therapist... obviously). I guess I'm just tired of feeling alone in a crowded room and wondered if anyone else felt the same. Please feel free to tell me about your experiences like this if you have any as it would really help me feel like I'm a little less broken of a person by knowing that there is someone who feels similarly. I'm just going to leave this here as I have work and many other things to get done today, but I'll be back to see any responses later on tonight.

Kinda urgent,"I have posted this in other groups, but I thought I’d ask for advice here as well, bc I feel like y’all would maybe be able to relate on some level

Let me start out by saying, I (17M) have severe Paranoid Personality Disorder. There’s this guy I go to school with, Let’s call him A. A and I are sort of friends, like we’ll say hello when we walk past each other, but nothing much else. 

A is having a party tonight, and I just found out he invited my entire friend group, except me. Most of my friend group don’t like A at all, but they’re going anyway. A invited my best friend (who hates him) my girlfriend (who is good friends with him, so that’s understandable) and 5 of my other friends, each of whom don’t really know him. 

My paranoia is making me believe he’s singled me out. He told my girlfriend he was going to invite her friends so that she’ll have people to talk to, but he doesn’t invite me. My most of my friend group, including my girlfriend, don’t see the problem, and to be honest, that hurts. I know I sound like a bratty little kid, but I know I’m going to see stories on Snapchat of all the fun they’re having, and it’s going to negatively impact me, and I don’t know what to do.

This whole situation is obviously making me jealous. Being left out doesn’t feel great to anyone, but that, coupled with my paranoia, is going to make me feel even more jealous than usual.

The party is in like 15 minutes, and I know that seeing all my friends together having fun without me, at the party of someone they don’t even like, is going to hurt me mentally, and I don’t know what to do to stop thinking about it. In the past I have had to miss events my group has organised, and every time, I have cried seeing them having the time of their life (I’m a sensitive guy anyway, and the littlest things make me cry, so please forgive me lmao). 

I’ve already spoken to my best friend about the situation (I’m not going to mention it to my girlfriend, because she always thinks I’m being over dramatic with things like this) and he agreed that it’s a shitty thing to do to someone, and he’s offered to ask A what that’s all about, so we’ll see.

Anyway, to bring things to a close, does anyone have any advice on how I can stop feeling jealous in this situation? I would love to be able to just not look at Snapchat or Instagram, and avoid al the videos of the fun, but I’m going to inevitably open it in the morning, so I’ll see them anyway.

Vivid daydreams of my death,"It’s been a tiring few months. I juggle with my family fighting, my own depression and anxiety.

I remember I couldn’t go in public anymore, I hate people looking at me. My anxiety got so bad that I threw up thinking of people looking at me. I fucking hate myself so much.

All of this has made me start daydreaming vividly while I’m at work. I had a daydream that my family buried me and I was watching myself lower 6ft. It fucking hurt so bad because I was wanting to scream for help but it was 3rd person. I never want my family to bury me, why did my brain show me this.

Less than one week notice due to depression.,"(I already posted in r/jobs but I couldn't figure how to crosspost from there to here).

Hi.

My mental health is at an all time low right now, and the current job that I'm at now exasperates my depression, and has been for a while (I work at an assisted living facility).

I know two weeks notice is customary and the best things to do, but the thought of working another shift after my work week ends makes me panic and want to cry. I know myself enough that if I worked another shift I wouldn't be doing the best thing for myself and it would be unfair to the consumers I assist.

My question is, how do I get across to all my managers + schedulers that I'm leaving so suddenly not for the fun of it, but because my mental health and stability depends on it, while staying professional? And how do I get rid of that guilt that I feel leaving all the coworkers and managers and consumers that I love behind, as well as the guilt of knowing that they'll be scrambling to cover my shifts since we're pretty understaffed?

"I’ve always felt like if I wasn’t the best, I was nothing. And now I am nothing, but I don’t want to be anymore.","I always felt like, if I wasn’t the most successful, most talented and most driven person in the room, then my life wouldn’t matter. There was a point where I was on my way to success and I had greatness at my fingertips, but I let it all slip away when I got depressed. Then I thought, if I’m not going to be the best and most talented person in the room, I may as well be fucking dead. That’s how I’ve felt these past 5 years. Dead. I’m just this walking ghost now. However, something happened a few weeks ago. My family finally cut me off financially. After years of being a nobody because of how miserable I was at my failures. I always thought this was the last straw. This was the thing that would break me and push me over the edge. But instead, a strange thing happened instead. My survival instincts kicked. And for the first time in my life, I not only wanted to live, but I wanted to do something to be better. I’m starting to feel inspired to get my life in order again. Losing everything has freed me.

I don't know how to talk anymore,"I used to be able to articulate why I was upset or how I felt in general but I don't think I know how anymore.

I just turned 20 a few days ago. It was a shitty birthday and I've learned to hate birthdays. It's something about feeling entitled to happiness for just one day and not obtaining it. This was my upbringing. I grew up in an abusive household and I always thought (back when I believed in God) that God would stop the abuse for one day a year, if I prayed hard enough. It never did.

Today my friend insisted on having a ""party"" of some sort for my birthday. I said okay because I thought it would make her happy. She brought her ex girlfriend over and my boyfriend was at work. They flirted the whole way through and eventually I just smoked some pot, stopped interacting, and started debugging some Assembly code. Eventually they took the cue that they should leave.

I guess I want to talk to someone about feeling shitty. About trauma. About all the shit in life. But looking through my contacts there's no one. And even if there were, what the hell would I say? ""Sorry for wasting your time, but I'm sad""? Or should I say, ""I'm sad"" but without the apology, or should I say that I just want to rant? People are busy. I'm good at keeping my shit together. It's not like any of my feelings change any outcomes in life.

My SO used to be a good person to talk to about this shit. As are all new relationships that I've ever had. I think that men think I'm pretty so they put up with more baggage near the start. As time goes on, they listen less and less. Not like they lose interest in me persay - my SO just moved 500 miles to be with me - but just that my sadness and my feelings aren't worth discussing. That we should just cuddle, have sex, and joke around.

I don't know how to talk. Part of me wants to cheat on my SO just to be listened to by a stranger. Another part of me realises that I can't afford to fuck up the little good that I have in my life. And part of me thinks that I should just ignore being sad and get over myself because I have life a lot better than a lot of people.",zrozumiesz,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jh0zz8/i_dont_know_how_to_talk_anymore/,used able articulate wa upset felt general think know anymore turned 20 day ago wa shitty birthday learned hate birthday something feeling entitled happiness one day obtaining wa upbringing grew abusive household always thought back believed god god would stop abuse one day year prayed hard enough never today friend insisted party sort birthday said okay thought would make happy brought ex girlfriend boyfriend wa work flirted whole way eventually smoked pot stopped interacting started debugging assembly code eventually took cue leave guess want talk someone feeling shitty trauma shit life looking contact one even hell would say sorry wasting time sad say sad without apology say want rant people busy good keeping shit together like feeling change outcome life used good person talk shit new relationship ever think men think pretty put baggage near start time go listen le le like lose interest persay moved 500 mile sadness feeling worth discussing cuddle sex joke around know talk part want cheat listened stranger another part realises afford fuck little good life part think ignore sad get life lot better lot people,know talk anymore,z ro zu mies z,2107,32,z ro zu mies z used able articulate wa upset felt general think know anymore turned 20 day ago wa shitty birthday learned hate birthday something feeling entitled happiness one day obtaining wa upbringing grew abusive household always thought back believed god god would stop abuse one day year prayed hard enough never today friend insisted party sort birthday said okay thought would make happy brought ex girlfriend boyfriend wa work flirted whole way eventually smoked pot stopped interacting started debugging assembly code eventually took cue leave guess want talk someone feeling shitty trauma shit life looking contact one even hell would say sorry wasting time sad say sad without apology say want rant people busy good keeping shit together like feeling change outcome life used good person talk shit new relationship ever think men think pretty put baggage near start time go listen le le like lose interest persay moved 500 mile sadness feeling worth discussing cuddle sex joke around know talk part want cheat listened stranger another part realises afford fuck little good life part think ignore sad get life lot better lot people know talk anymore

"Do you know this situation when the dreams you had at night were so vivid and beautiful and basically what you want the most in life, so that you wake up super melancholic?","I don’t know if i am alone with this, but it sucks. 
I’ve always have been an intense dreamer, with my dreams usually being based within the bounds of reality. By that i mean I always dream of interactions with real people or dream of past memories. All my dreams basically could or really have happened at some point in my life. 


Now, I have been dealing with manic depression for the better half of the last decade, but nowadays due to therapy and changes i’ve made to myself and life i am not only content with my depression, but relatively happy in life. I work a fulfilling job and finally enjoy a social life again too. I am more energetic than ever and can enjoy the little time again. Basically i feel stable. 

But some days man, fuck. Just like today. I’m still not over a breakup kind of, and tonight’s dreams completely destroyed me. Like, i am happy with my life right now and super proud of my progress, but if i could choose it still would be different just because she’s not here right now. I miss her. And dreaming of her tonight and us being together just fucks me up. 

Doesn’t help that i really dream intensely.  When i dream it feels like i am there, at times to a point where waking up feels like the real dream. It’s like a punch to my gut

Prozac working but frustrating side effect...,"I'm taking fluoxetine / Prozac and have been on it about 4 months, after switching from setraline that I was on for around the same period of time.

For the most part it works. Before I found no happiness or enjoyment in things and slept very little. Now I sleep a bit better, am less anxious (though still get some bad days) and found I'm more confident about myself and oddly even more willing to take risks.

What is a 'mental institution' actually like?,"Based UK here,25M - have tried the NHS Steps2wellbeing therapy scheme, tried 2 sorts of anti-depressants, tried talking to my friends etc. but ofc they have their own lives and cannot be there for me 24/7.as much as they do care.

I regularly have bad 'dreams' and thoughts - I feel my memory is fading (I put something down and then instantly lose it for the next 10mins), I've gained weight over the lockdown with no gym, covid took my job and my landlord wants me out because he's had to sell the house despite me in it (so moving back to parents for a while and arguably my mother is the worst for my mental health). So uprooting what life I had made here despite 3 yrs of no 'progress' in my life (3yrs of being single - no relationship which in turn hurts your confidence and wellbeing) etc etc etc. I've lost almost all pleasure in doing things, and I wonder if I should check in to one because nothing else seems to work. 

But then again, being recorded as having been to these institutions means certain consequences - I volunteer with the ACF, and tbh I enjoy it more than I don't (kids always have a way of making me laugh) but would this mean I would be prohibited from attending? Also, I'm considering possibly trying for a military-sponsored course which seems like a fascinating opportunity but would this negate any possibility of getting a job with them? I view myself as having a duty to the cadets so there is no threat of me to them - indeed my big complaint about my 'single life' is the lack of purpose - feeling like a robot (get up - eat - work - eat - sleep - repeat).

Does anyone have any tips for hiding your depression? I am DESPERATE. Anything would do.,"
It's difficult for me to act all happy and energetic now a days, and I can feel that I'm becoming a burden. I'm not sure if my parents and older sister knows or maybe they do but they just don't care at all.

I was quite adept at hiding this little demon before, but now I can't help but feel more sluggish and heavy all the time. I WANT to sleep all the time. And I'm sometimes a little irritated. I try so so so fucking hard to hide it just like before but it's just so difficult now. Can someone help me please. I don't want to be a burden. I know it's not healthy, yes. I just need to bottle em up and hide them properly and I'll be okay. I don't need anymore help when it comes to overcoming my depression. It has been with me for almost 11 years now (and I was quite okay at hiding it...until now). I know it won't ever leave me. I just NEED to know how to hide it effectively.

I Can't Hold a Job :(,"Anyone else? I go through a cycle of starting a job, struggling, leaving and then when I find a new job the cycle repeats. I feel so useless. There is a clear pattern here as my last few jobs were like this. They were all retail gigs and dealing with people is just so difficult for me. I have struggled with my last few jobs and this new one is no different. It just makes me feel like I'm not even a human being or worth anything if I can't even perform at a basic 9-5 job given my age. I've struggled with my depression and anxiety for so long, it makes facing work so unbelievably difficult. I just feel like I have no value as a person.

Feeling like I'm Relapsing.,"Hey everyone, I had a strong first depression about 3 or 4 years ago, it took me around 9 months to get out of depression (did took some meds, was gradually lowering the dosage until now).

I basically had for the most part my sh*t together but since covid started, I started to stay at home mostly, in my room playing videogames and wasting times.

Since about 3 days ago, I started to have stronger thoughts related to guilt from the past, I just wanted to ask for some advice, now that I feel like I am better prepared, and more confident in the fact that all of this ""mental gymnastics"" to make us feel really low is not productive at all, I believe I may have a way out from this next depression in the making sooner than later.

1. I already have a psychiatrist (will try to contact him as soon as I can).

2. Will try to sleep earlier and wake earlier.

3. For the moment I am doubling my dosage. (It was very small the beging with, but I will not take a chance).

Any more tips are welcomed.

Thanks and I hope all the best for all of you in these difficult situations.",StablePopsicle,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jh3v8g/feeling_like_im_relapsing/,hey everyone strong first depression 3 4 year ago took around 9 month get depression took med wa gradually lowering dosage basically part sh together since covid started started stay home mostly room playing videogames wasting time since 3 day ago started stronger thought related guilt past wanted ask advice feel like better prepared confident fact mental gymnastics make u feel really low productive believe may way next depression making sooner later 1 already psychiatrist try contact soon 2 try sleep earlier wake earlier 3 moment doubling dosage wa small beging take chance tip welcomed thanks hope best difficult situation,feeling like relapsing,stable popsicle,1077,27,stable popsicle hey everyone strong first depression 3 4 year ago took around 9 month get depression took med wa gradually lowering dosage basically part sh together since covid started started stay home mostly room playing videogames wasting time since 3 day ago started stronger thought related guilt past wanted ask advice feel like better prepared confident fact mental gymnastics make u feel really low productive believe may way next depression making sooner later 1 already psychiatrist try contact soon 2 try sleep earlier wake earlier 3 moment doubling dosage wa small beging take chance tip welcomed thanks hope best difficult situation feeling like relapsing
I've Completely Lost the Will to Fight,"I'm an education major who decided on this path a long time ago because I legitimately wanted to help students who struggle with school the way I did. In particular I've wanted to work with less fortunate students from lower income communities. I finally started my student teaching last semester and things were going great (or so I thought). Covid hit and things got cut short but we managed and so I went into this semester hopeful things would work out. Well they didn't and today things came to a head with me finding out the teacher I've been working with has been lying to my face telling me she's very happy with my work all while telling my supervisor the complete opposite. On top of that I've been called a liar when trying to refute the claims and even being told I ""must have deleted"" an email I never received.

I'm no stranger to tough times and depression and anxiety. In fact I only just stopped attending counseling about a year ago after an ordeal that nearly had me commit myself. However, no matter how bad it got there was always that small flame or voice or whatever deep down that told me ""keep going for the kids"". After today though that voice is gone. I don't care about helping students anymore. I don't want to keep being a punching bag just to save a couple kids who struggle. I have family and friends in education who have been telling me all day about times they put their careers on the line to help students and how it almost broke them but they kept going because they wanted to help those kids and I just don't get it anymore.

They tell me I'll face adversity in any profession, and they're right, but at least in another profession if make more money. Why should I keep going in a profession where I'm not respected, treated like dirty, and paid peanuts when I can't even bring myself to care?

Idk I'm just so broken. I've felt depression that kept me from being able to get out of bed, I've had crippling anxiety that caused me to be hospitalized, but I've never felt the sort of hate and lack of hope I feel now. I've been moved to a new school with a new cooperating teacher but I honestly don't even care. The thought of continuing to become a teacher fills me with nothing but disgust in all the wasted years and dollars I put into this degree. Honestly if not for that money and being so close I'd just drop it now and move on to something else.

College was a mistake and I hate myself for listening to those that encouraged me to go, but most of all I hate myself for ever thinking that this path was worth it. I should've listened to my friends who told me to go with the money rather than wanting to make a difference.

I've been in tears all day but now all that's left is hate and a desire to curl up and die. The fire that kept me fighting through a panic attack that left me hospitalized and brought me back from a 2.4 gpa to a 3.2 has been extinguished and I hate myself for it.",tataunka813,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jh22vo/ive_completely_lost_the_will_to_fight/,education major decided path long time ago legitimately wanted help student struggle school way particular wanted work le fortunate student lower income community finally started student teaching last semester thing going great thought covid hit thing got cut short managed went semester hopeful thing would work well today thing came head finding teacher working ha lying face telling happy work telling supervisor complete opposite top called liar trying refute claim even told must deleted email never received stranger tough time depression anxiety fact stopped attending counseling year ago ordeal nearly commit however matter bad got wa always small flame voice whatever deep told keep going kid today though voice gone care helping student anymore want keep punching bag save couple kid struggle family friend education telling day time put career line help student almost broke kept going wanted help kid get anymore tell face adversity profession right least another profession make money keep going profession respected treated like dirty paid peanut even bring care idk broken felt depression kept able get bed crippling anxiety caused hospitalized never felt sort hate lack hope feel moved new school new cooperating teacher honestly even care thought continuing become teacher fill nothing disgust wasted year dollar put degree honestly money close drop move something else college wa mistake hate listening encouraged go hate ever thinking path wa worth listened friend told go money rather wanting make difference tear day left hate desire curl die fire kept fighting panic attack left hospitalized brought back 2 4 gpa 3 2 ha extinguished hate,completely lost fight,tata un ka 813,2933,38,tata un ka 813 education major decided path long time ago legitimately wanted help student struggle school way particular wanted work le fortunate student lower income community finally started student teaching last semester thing going great thought covid hit thing got cut short managed went semester hopeful thing would work well today thing came head finding teacher working ha lying face telling happy work telling supervisor complete opposite top called liar trying refute claim even told must deleted email never received stranger tough time depression anxiety fact stopped attending counseling year ago ordeal nearly commit however matter bad got wa always small flame voice whatever deep told keep going kid today though voice gone care helping student anymore want keep punching bag save couple kid struggle family friend education telling day time put career line help student almost broke kept going wanted help kid get anymore tell face adversity profession right least another profession make money keep going profession respected treated like dirty paid peanut even bring care idk broken felt depression kept able get bed crippling anxiety caused hospitalized never felt sort hate lack hope feel moved new school new cooperating teacher honestly even care thought continuing become teacher fill nothing disgust wasted year dollar put degree honestly money close drop move something else college wa mistake hate listening encouraged go hate ever thinking path wa worth listened friend told go money rather wanting make difference tear day left hate desire curl die fire kept fighting panic attack left hospitalized brought back 2 4 gpa 3 2 ha extinguished hate completely lost fight

Why is everything going wrong when I'm trying my best?,"I don't know what depression really is and I really don't know if what is going on with me really even compares to the tragedies that are happening to everyone else here. What I do know is that I'm desperate for advice and I have no friends or family to talk to. I was always a good kid in school and even graduated with high honors but I had a problem with drugs. I smoked almost daily including in school and I used to make excuses saying that it was for fun or because I was bored and there was nothing better to do. After some psychedelic experiences I realized that in reality it was because I've always been scared to show people who I really am. My senior year I tried changing my style to express myself the way I wanted to but that wasn't enough. The last months of school on top of smoking I was abusing melatonin and nyquil because sleep became my escape. During quarantine it finally hit me that what I needed to change wasn't myself physically, what I needed was to stop hiding behind drugs. My ""best friend"" was an addict that I wasn't even close to; our only relationship was drugs. My other friends weren't actual friends either, we hung out all the time but never went into deep conversations and didn't even share the same interests like we did in middle school. I was determined to not let that stop me so I decided that I was going to become a better sober self. I quit the drugs. I picked up running, reading, and playing guitar. I started eating better. I got into a good school under mechanical engineering. I got scholarships. I got my drivers license. Everything was going great but then something hit me. Everything started feeling forced and I was feeling burnout. I thought that it could've been not having anyone to talk to so I started trying to make new friends from my new school and things were good but then messaging back became exhausting. I kept hurting myself when running and today I twisted my ankle so bad that I don't think I'm going to be able to run for a while. School isn't super hard but it does feel exhausting. When I started school I was on top of everything and I have once again become a procrastinator. I wish I could cry but I feel like I'm too scared to show my emotions to myself. Why do I feel this way? What can I do to numb that pain away when good hobbies aren't doing it?

An open letter to my therapist,"Dear A,

We met almost a year ago now. I remember searching for therapists online and then coming across your profile. You seemed open minded. Things weren’t working out with my previous therapist. I desperately needed help. My emotions were consuming me. I couldn’t go through this alone. I’m so glad I made the decision to reach out to you. This past year has not been an easy road. I often feel like a difficult client because I never seem to get better. You never make me feel like one though. Ive wanted to give up so many times in the last year. I try to convince myself the therapy isn’t working or I am a lost cause. But I keep coming back. At the end of each appointment you always have me schedule another one for the next week and I keep coming back. I always wait and expect you to say maybe I should look elsewhere, but that never happens. You stick with me. You’ve helped me realize that I see the world through a black and white lens. My brain has a tendency to view things as all good or all bad. I struggle to see the gray area. This affects almost every area of my life. Even in therapy it makes it hard. You never shame me. You’ve helped me realize I put a lot of shame on myself. You remind me that I deserve to be happy and to be treated well by others. These may seem like small things, but I truly didn’t feel I was worthy of love and respect. A year ago I would have had no courage to set boundaries because I was afraid of upsetting people. You made me realize that I didn’t deserve to be sent away to boarding schools as a child. I always thought I was inherently bad and kind of just messed up by nature. You remind me over and over again that I am not broken. I look forward every week to talking with you. You give me a time to get things off my chest. Sometimes your advice doesn’t click right away but will later on. It’s been a year and I’m not in remission by any means, but I know so much more about myself. I am beginning to notice my mind’s habit of going down the rabbit hole. You are there for me week after week. You sit the whole hour and listen to me even when a lot of the time I’m not doing well. You didn’t have to be a therapist. You could have picked some other job where people aren’t laying their burdens all over you everyday. I am so thankful for you. Because of you, I didn’t have to go through all of this alone this past year. You inspired me to try mindfulness. When I can get myself to practice, I feel a little better and more clear minded for a bit. Same with journaling. I’m still at the beginning of my healing journey. I’m learning it’s not an easy fix and you remind me that is okay. It is okay to have good and bad weeks. It is okay to sit with my emotions. I don’t need to live in shame.

Do things ever go back to normal?,"Does depression ever really go away? Will the thought that things would be better if I was dead ever stop coming to me? Will I ever be able to just stop crying at the slightest song lyric or news headline or movie line. I feel like I can be doing so good and suddenly the thought comes out of nowhere that if I killed myself I wouldn’t ever have to suffer again. As much as I truly want to be happy again I feel like I’m stuck in this sadness and that I want to be sad, like it’s where I should be.

No one will understand me ever and I am done trying.,"My ongoing battle with depression for the past 9 years(started when I was 14 till today and maybe till my last breath :)).I have gone to doctors ,taken therapy ,talked to family members and some friends (now I have none - I stopped communication since pandemic since people are increasing my depression by talking about deaths, Unemployment,suicides blah blah.)

I can't sleep at night, I walk around my house.Even Songs and good food which used to be my guilty pleasure once , No more excite me.My whole family sleeps while I am awake alone and crying.I wake up later than all my family members in afternoon and no one is bothered anymore to wake me up at morning with others.

People around me criticize me for everything because they have full confidence that I will ruin everything because I am Depressed.Because I cry often when I am insulted they believe that I am doing a drama to get their attention or want something.I am neither complimented nor thanked for anything that I do for others so I am just with myself as no one can hurt or insult me anymore.Even when I ask them to talk to me when I have panic attacks they just say ""hmmm"" and look into their phones busy reading their feeds or doze off when I try to coversate.They don't even take me outside and ask me to go alone( And I can't go alone because I have social anxiety .Hence I am inside my home since 6 months of lockdown and pandemic.)

Friends rather than wishing me good always ask ""is everything fine with you?"" ,""Are u ok?"" And what irks me most is when they say..""What has happened now! "", ""what's making you sad now?!"".

People try to prove me that depression is some sort of luxury that only lazy or weak hearted people resort to when they want to escape life ,which is not true.I want to do things but my mind and body doesn't support and even if I try I am being scolded like hell.

Hence I am done with people because no one understands me and I hate my life.",I_admire_simplicity,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jh5qr1/no_one_will_understand_me_ever_and_i_am_done/,ongoing battle depression past 9 year started wa 14 till today maybe till last breath gone doctor taken therapy talked family member friend none stopped communication since pandemic since people increasing depression talking death unemployment suicide blah blah sleep night walk around house even song good food used guilty pleasure excite whole family sleep awake alone cry wake later family member afternoon one bothered anymore wake morning others people around criticize everything full confidence ruin everything depressed cry often insulted believe drama get attention want something neither complimented thanked anything others one hurt insult anymore even ask talk panic attack say hmmm look phone busy reading feed doze try coversate even take outside ask go alone go alone social anxiety hence inside home since 6 month lockdown pandemic friend rather wishing good always ask everything fine u ok irks say ha happened making sad people try prove depression sort luxury lazy weak hearted people resort want escape life true want thing mind body support even try scolded like hell hence done people one understands hate life,one understand ever done trying,admire simplicity,1942,52,admire simplicity ongoing battle depression past 9 year started wa 14 till today maybe till last breath gone doctor taken therapy talked family member friend none stopped communication since pandemic since people increasing depression talking death unemployment suicide blah blah sleep night walk around house even song good food used guilty pleasure excite whole family sleep awake alone cry wake later family member afternoon one bothered anymore wake morning others people around criticize everything full confidence ruin everything depressed cry often insulted believe drama get attention want something neither complimented thanked anything others one hurt insult anymore even ask talk panic attack say hmmm look phone busy reading feed doze try coversate even take outside ask go alone go alone social anxiety hence inside home since 6 month lockdown pandemic friend rather wishing good always ask everything fine u ok irks say ha happened making sad people try prove depression sort luxury lazy weak hearted people resort want escape life true want thing mind body support even try scolded like hell hence done people one understands hate life one understand ever done trying
I have nothing left,"
I am not suicidal, I know this life is too much of a privilege and it would be a disservice to those living and dying, by ways out of their control, to prematurely take my own life. It would inadvertently affect others in a way I know I could not do, not to mention the thought of doing something like that is scary. 

However, I definitely don’t care if I have any time left on this planet. I really don’t enjoy anything, and I feel like I hurt those around me more than I help them. I think I may defect to a mountainside and live out my days on a garden and some ingenuity. At least from this perspective I see less pain. Not for myself but for the world around me. Leaving the rest of the living so that they must not carry the burden of myself on their shoulders any longer. 

Resilience is of priority, as with all things in life, but I have given myself too much credit, and have been too far from critical of my own actions or reasonable about my impact on my loved ones. With recent situations bringing to light the flaws of my character in a way I’ve never more clearly understood, it seems the scars may run too deep to ever recover in a meaningful way. 

Somewhere in the future I see a little light, far away from myself and many lives removed, forever brightening as I fade into the lessening shadows.

Am I just fighting a losing battle?,"Kinda new here and I hope you'll bare with me.

I've known this friend for just under 3 years now and I know she has depression, anxiety and CPTSD.

Unfortunately, I myself been in a pretty fortunate position where before a short 2 years career depression, I'm pretty normal.

I've tried to read and understand about depression but I believe her depression is rather unique.. it's less a 'positional depression' and rather, a 'environmental/society' depression.. what I mean by that is this -

She feels the people in the world could be better but they choose not to.  She hates how the world is going with this selflessness but is depression cause she needs to partake in this mockery of existence.

Here the issue thought 
- I've tried to understand but I can't and I know providing solutions is slowly driving us apart
- she's now met someone (b) whom, I believe, due to her (b) own history, is more sensitive towards what she's going thru and I can see the friendship getting stronger and stronger and the 3 years we've been together is now basically, disappearing before my eyes.
- when I visit, we normally go driving to get food and we'll chat and she'll sit close to me.  Lately, she's pretty up pressed up against the door and seriously, if I open the door, she'll fall out.

I know this sounds like a relationship question but the reason I'm asking in here..

People who are depressed, friends that you've known for 3 years.. do you find them easily replaced if they are unable to understand your situation and someone else come along who can?.

There's other dynamic that I won't go into details but just curious..

What do you say to those that are in this 'world' depression and should I just moved off?",ReleaseBasic,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jh5kad/am_i_just_fighting_a_losing_battle/,kinda new hope bare known friend 3 year know ha depression anxiety cptsd unfortunately pretty fortunate position short 2 year career depression pretty normal tried read understand depression believe depression rather unique le positional depression rather environmental society depression mean feel people world could better choose hate world going selflessness depression cause need partake mockery existence issue thought tried understand know providing solution slowly driving u apart met someone b believe due b history sensitive towards going thru see friendship getting stronger stronger 3 year together basically disappearing eye visit normally go driving get food chat sit close lately pretty pressed door seriously open door fall know sound like relationship question reason asking people depressed friend known 3 year find easily replaced unable understand situation someone else come along dynamic go detail curious say world depression moved,fighting losing battle,release basic,1716,35,release basic kinda new hope bare known friend 3 year know ha depression anxiety cptsd unfortunately pretty fortunate position short 2 year career depression pretty normal tried read understand depression believe depression rather unique le positional depression rather environmental society depression mean feel people world could better choose hate world going selflessness depression cause need partake mockery existence issue thought tried understand know providing solution slowly driving u apart met someone b believe due b history sensitive towards going thru see friendship getting stronger stronger 3 year together basically disappearing eye visit normally go driving get food chat sit close lately pretty pressed door seriously open door fall know sound like relationship question reason asking people depressed friend known 3 year find easily replaced unable understand situation someone else come along dynamic go detail curious say world depression moved fighting losing battle

Big episode yesterday. I woke up full of hope for a good day. I had some basic self-care plans. I couldn’t.

I was in front of my PC for the entire day. I forgot to eat. I forgot to drink. I forgot to wash. I didn’t talk to anyone. I just couldn’t.

Today will be better. I have to go to work again.

That’s the funny thing, no matter how down I am, I can always make it to work.

I’m lost,"So I’ve been struggling a lot lately, although I know many people, especially in recent months, have suffered much much worse than me. I’m in high school, and I’ve recently moved (although only 20 minutes away). Since lockdown started in the spring, I literally haven’t heard from any of my friends. At first I thought, you know, everyone’s having a hard time, I’m not going to judge them or take it personally. Then on their social media they post first zoom or FaceTime chats, then in person activities they’re doing together. And I’m not in on any of it. Fair enough, I hadn’t really reached out. I reach out, like “hey! How’ve you been? It’s been awhile since we talked!!” And they’d answer blandly and leave me on read eventually. I do this a couple times before realizing they really don’t want to talk to me. So literally, since March, zero friends have reached out to me. I don’t think I have friends anymore. I thought they were my good friends, but now I’m not so sure. I hadn’t lived there too long, but I’ve moved way too many times in my life. At my new school, understandably, no one really wants to reach out. It makes sense. We’re hybrid, distanced, wearing masks, and they haven’t seen their friends in months. It makes sense they aren’t going to want to talk to the new kid. I’ve tried a couple times to talk to people, but often it results in a visible distaste for socializing with me. I hope it isn’t all in my head. I’ve moved countless times all my life, and I’ve never had any problems putting myself out there and making friends...I understand it but I don’t. It makes me feel like I’ve changed, or that no one really likes me. I literally have no one to talk to, and I feel a crippling loneliness. I’m on edge all the time, feeling depressed, and am almost always on the verge of tears. and therapy is not an answer for a multitude of reasons. I’ve always been a good student, but my motivation is completely down the drain, and I feel like I have nothing to look forward to. Most of my extracurriculars, including me being in leadership roles and captains of teams were lost when I moved schools. I would have to restart, but I’m already a junior. I was a 4.0 student and competitive for top schools... it’s what I have been working on for years as one of my life goals and it’s all slipping away so fast. The things that made me me, such as being funny, motivated &amp; smart, have gone down the drain. I feel like I’m not the same person anymore. I don’t know what to do.

There are imposters among myself,"(Before you begin to read, the title was to sorta of hook you in and get some sort of laugh)

For the past 2-3ish months it has been nothing but hell for me, and the only thing I do to escape is play video games, so I got online and I was waiting for an invitation to a party filled with people who I consider friends. I waited and waited so then I said screw it I’ll join manually. I don’t usually do that because I don’t like joining parties out of nowhere because I’m afraid of them not wanting me in there. I say “hi” and got no response like usually. Then the night went on as usual. They start talking and if I talk or put my two cents in about something my brother tells me to shut up and his friends and my friends gang up on me and I get insulted about stuff I did in the past (i did nothing bad to clarify, just mistakes) then I go mute for the rest of the night until someone acknowledges me then I say “hi” then it repeats.

Now a rather more specific situation that happened 4 days ago.

I was playing Minecraft and I was acting upset about everything and about what was going to happen to me probably. (I’m also a pessimist) my friend asks me “hey what’s wrong” and then I proceed to tell what has been going on. I say “hey you still here?” To check if they are still listening. *no response* I say “hello?” *still no response* I assumed she left to go do something without telling me that she had to go do something (which no one I know does that and I mean NO ONE) ,so I assumed that she didn’t care. 

I tried to talk to another friend, but they had stuff going on too so when that happens I bury my thoughts and feelings until the issue is resolved. I was expecting for him talk to me about it because we have done it before, but I still have no clue what is going on.

That friend had helped me in the past by telling me what my friends said behind my back and from what he told me that he was crying because he felt bad for me. I didn’t want to know what they were saying because I just wanted to play video games.

To rap up the rest of it because it is 2:46 AM for me 

My friend’s blame me for stuff I didn’t do, they insult me, they don’t talk to me on Snapchat; no one responds, I’ll join to talk to them, but they try to piss me off and get a chuckle out of it.

Anyways i feel like im a jester to them, I feel like they want to push me away, and to me they’re the only friends I have and if I don’t have them with me I’ll just be lonely like I’am 95% of the day. I don’t go outside I’m doing online school because I had a choice, I don’t get invited to things, and I feel im the last person someone thinks of.

They’re all I have left to talk, relate, and share my feelings with.

They’re all I have left

I have lost interest in everything and I don't know how much longer I can keep pretending everything is ok. Because I know it's not.,"I've lost interest in my hobbies, activities I once enjoyed, people I used to talk to and hang out with. I am realizing more and more that people are not really who you think they are. That all interactions are based upon some sort of special condition. There is no more unconditional love in this world. People are really fake and you can see it on their face and hear it in their voice. I am a grocery store worker, union job, in it for a long time. I've held many jobs over the years but working this job through Covid has been a nightmarish rollercoaster ride from the beginning. The worst. When you work for such jobs as this the management in these places sucks. Grocery stores attract the sort of ""misfits"" in life and often times straight up sociopaths and creeps. Let's just say I have not been well taken care of or respected through this by my employer, who is a very well respected name in the industry around here. Quite the opposite in fact they treat us like sh\*t even more so. I used to live together with my longtime girl friend who was the love of my life. Now I live alone, for the past 5-6 months I am alone pretty much all the time. She was the sunshine in my life. We did everything together. We went to bed together and woke up together everyday for 6 years.  we helped each other, we looked out for each other, we loved each other. I did her laundry every week, I got up at 5AM to make her coffee in the morning before she left for work when my shift did not start until 12 in the afternoon I would get up with her because I didn't want her to go out to her car alone in the dark and I wanted to help her with time on making the coffee. I did whatever I could to try to make her comfy and feel loved.  She was the reason why I kept going everyday, and plans for our future. well her and to take care of the damn dog. And that's really all I had at the end of the day. Sure I had hobbies and stuff, but none of that really matters to me. She was my family at this point in my life. Now I just have a dying dog at home who I am going to have to put to sleep soon due to old age. Her ex-boyfriend killed himself a few months ago from Vicodin and drinking bottles of liquor everyday because he was a coward and couldn't handle life anymore apparently and he decided he would just slowly drink himself to death and pop pills until he died at a young age. He still had his family here! I don't understand people like that! His mother, his father, brother, sister. It's a sad story really. But I don't understand, he took his family for granted. I wish I had my mother and father here by me still, gosh what I would do just to be able to sit with them one more time, just once.. This asshole had them all the time and was like oh poor me my life sucks wa wa wa. People suck. So much fake ness everywhere. No real integrity anymore. People even discount their own flesh and blood now days over some BS. The news of this loser dying shocked my girlfriend so much that she now couldn't handle life anymore so our relationship fell apart during his extensive time in the hospital and all that ensued with her from there on (not coming home anymore etc.) She became a completely different person and no longer cared about seeing me, texting me or answering my calls, or our dog, or coming home at all. She had told me once in tears that she had realized that she loved him still after she found out he was dying, but then later recanted that statement and then said it was only because she realized that she isn't fit to be in a relationship because she needs to work on herself now and be alone. But in reality it was that she wasn't over him yet and she finally realized that. She just didn't have the maturity level or the guts to tell me that herself. That was a major blow for me. That really took me down into the depths of depression. That coupled with our word being completely flipped upside down and shutdown due to covid was enough to put me into a state of numbing depression. I trusted her more than anyone in this world out of all the people I have ever known I was certain I could trust her. I was so sure. Boy was I wrong. This man was an overweight alcoholic thief (lost his job because he stole product regularly and finally got caught) that punched her in the face on more than one occasion yet she still wanted to run to his aide and she left me hanging. Thats why she left him when they were together. He beat her up in a drunken stupor. He was a real POS. I was 100% supportive of her doing whatever she wanted when we first found out about him being sick - sure go be with his family, help them, grieve , whatever you need  babe as long as you need I said. And she would be like ok thank you im sorry I love you ill be home. later... But eventually it turned into her falling out of love with me because she realized that she wasn't over him. And losing him was such a loss in her world that she realized her relationship with me was fake and just to fill in a void. 6 years! Who the fuck does that! We have so many memories together I know her entire family very well. My mother was killed by a large alcoholic abusive man. He beat her so bad he broke her cheek bone , re arranged her face and broke her back. She died years later from complications from her injuries and he spent 7 years in prison, got out, and is now still living, that piece of human shit. And that's life for ya. Mother fuckers. SO, THAT was another huge blow for me. To lose the love of my life to that. talk about ironic. Life has a funny way of showing you that you don't mean anything and your feelings don't mean anything and at the end of the day it's all on you, and only you. There is no one else that is really there for you. At the end of the day we are alone. And most will die alone.  I hope my day comes sooner than later. My dog is at the end of his life, after he goes I want to quit everything. I can't do this anymore. Especially with the holidays approaching. Yeah fuck this shit.

Alright,"I'm not even gonna format and structure this. I just need to rant. My mom hates all sources of fun, My dad thinks I'm a failure, my sister is so rude and my brother is a mix of them all. I've learned over the years that I can do absolutely nothing to make them proud, cuz they would just tell me to don better to catch up to my siblings. I used to think that school was my sanctuary. My getaway to my home life that I couldn't tell anyone about. I used to have friends who i though actually cared for me, and when i opened up to them, they provided support. They did, they really did. This made school shine brighter to me.  I am currently a 9th grader and this all peaches and cream in grade 7, but then came grade 8. My two shining stars (lets call them 1 and 2) were as bright as ever and honestly, i thought it was perfect. until November. I have no idea to this day as to why she did what she did. My guess is that she got jealous, because me and 1 were starting to get really close. 2 did everything she could to drive a wedge between the two of us... and it worked. I remember how toxic it was and how hard it was to even talk to 1, she just wouldn't let go. 1 even said that 2 dropped the problem. Eventually, 1 gave into 2 lies and split off from me. I was devastated. If you don't know, here in Canada we have a rodeo system in which you stay with your class, but switch rooms. I remember being constantly glared at, and verbally abused, and i could do nothing about it because they hid it all. Eventually, I started to move away from those two and went to two of my best friends. I told them about the problem and one of them was supportive and the other one was sus. of me (Lets call them 3 and 4) 3 (the nice one said that I could have depression, so i relayed it onto 4. Then he started asking me about anti depressants and if i had any and all of that junk. Most of the time I didn't want to talk about it because first off, we are in the middle of class and second, I didn't have depression. So then he called me a liar. A fake. A phony and then blocked me. This was literally the day right before school got canceled due to covid. I was devastated. I don't know how many people he told that I was ""overreacting"" and that I ""lied"" about having depression. I wanted to die. Plus, now i had no safe space. I share a room with my brother because our house is small. And my brother, he's the worst person ever. I had to train my pre friends to act a certain way around him because he's a snitch and will do anything, ANYTHING from lying to flat stealing, get you in trouble. He also has a big problem with privacy and he's older than me. He also loves to argue because he always wins by cutting people off your hitting them. Obviously, my parents didn't care because if i were to tell them they would tell BOTH of us that they were sick of our fighting and we needed to man up.   

&amp;#x200B;

He read all of my text messages. To my friends, about my life, projects, type of friends, this entire problem, my thoughts about him everything. To the bone. So now he's got a 1 up on me and I have to do everything he says. I'm stuck in a house with him too. Everyone always fighting (90% its my mom or brother) and I have no friends because they were either part of this thing, fake or drifted.

&amp;#x200B;

I really want you to hear this last part. I don't think I have depression because that's a big thing. But could I? I think I need help. Since my mom hates fun, I can't play with my friends and barely get time to text them. I need help. Anyone, please.

"Hello, i failed my suicide attempt","So to make story short, i took all my pills 10pcs or highly dangerous drugs, that you cant buy on pharmacy without level 3 license from your doctor kinda a stuff, at first. Im only thinking i takking the pills, i was fighting with my demons (that's what i called my manifested depression)...
And he clearly won, i was really shaking like im having a epilepsy,
Opening the tube and put it on my hands... That makes me more anxious, destructive, like i a sec i chucked it on my mouth, i shallowed all ten pcs, i panicked i cried, I don't know what to do...
And suddenly my demons told me that its fine everything will be fine.

Im not panicking, but still crying, then my brother heard my crying
Asking what's wrong, i hug my brother, and to him that i love him
And i cried out loud.
      I don't have a courage to tell to my brother that i done it, I'm finally free,...

      So my fucking stupid mind says goodbye to my friend, 
And then one of my friend drove really fast, to my house and took me to hospital,

Right now im on observation,.. most of the medicine are dissolved.
And i can't feel my legs....





The saddest part is... Im still alive,
Seeing people suffering because of my own demise

And im thinking to do it again. But making sure i will die even painful


So i can stop this nonsense thinking of mine, and the suffering from my closest people...

I hope I'll die over the next few months.,"I'm at a point where I want to die but don't want to kill myself. The reason why I don't want to do it myself is twofold: first, it'd hurt my family. Second, I might fail and permanently injure myself. I want someone or something else to kill me.

Looking at the current events, however, I think I might get a chance to die in the near future. Though my age makes me unlikely to die from COVID, I think a second American civil war is becoming increasingly likely given the current political situation in the US. It'll not only give me a chance to die, but I'll get to do so while serving my country. I just hope I'll be killed as painlessly as possible with as few other people dying as possible and that I won't go to hell.

I want to kill myself (metaphorically),"I don’t want to be here but I’m too scared of actually doing anything. I sometimes find myself day dreaming about running way to a beautiful place and I never looking back. I want to kill the person who I am. I want to start over. I want to just disappear before I can disappoint my parents. If I go missing they’d be sad for a while but they’d eventually forget about me. I feel that’s better than being a disappointment, I had so much potential but I don’t think I can do it anymore. I’m scared. I had such a bright future but I lost all my ambitions and dreams. It’s so weird how hopeful I used to be, I miss that old person I was. I don’t feel at home in my own home anymore. It just feels cold, my parents never really gave me love or attention but recently it’s been feeling colder. Everyday feels the same, I feel like I died and this is hell. Wake up, eat, school, get sad, get mad, sleep. I want to die or disappear but there’s something holding me back, not my parents or brother but my two younger cousins.

I feel pathetic for this,"Its important you guys know the backstory 1st. In middle school I met this girl. We soon became very close and became best friends and at one point we considered each other brother and sister. I had family issues at the time and was suicidal but she was there for me through most of it we would red each other back and fourth. She was there for me when I started cutting myself she was there for my on my 1st suicide attempt and I loved her more then anything on earth I would carry her stuff for her and comfort her when she went through a break up or was upset. I made a promise not to kill myself and to live for her sake as I cared about her so much I saw her as more then enough reason to live I loved her as if she was my sister.

Then high school came around and that's when it all fell apart. She started getting really agitated with me for no reason would just ignore me when she was around certain people and would try her best to avoid me. I would try to talk to her but she would just snap at me whenever I tried to talk to her about it. Finally after 3 months of putting up with the BS I just went off yelling at her the confrontation ended with me storming off that's all it was nothing more just yelling.

The rest of the school year was just pure hell as she had told everyone I was mentally abusing her and that I had her by the throat against the lockers. Because of this I was bullied both verbally and physically one time I was cornered in the boys bathroom and was beaten against the stall by one of her friends. I would constantly be insulted and made to feel guilty about shit I didn't even do to her. At one point she lied saying I tried to sexually assault her and the police got involved but they dropped the charges when they found out she was lying of course no punishment was given to her. 

It got to the point were I had to stay in class talking with the teachers who were the only ones who knew what was really going on after class and wait for everyone to pass in the hall as I was so scared of being beaten up or confronted. My now ex girlfriend broke up with me because she believed te girl over me. I had to switch schools the next year because I just couldn't deal with it any more I even attempted to overdoes on sleeping pills because of her.

But the torture continued as afterwards I was so traumatized by the incident that I developed PTSD over the situation if her name was even mentioned it would feel like my stomach would sink to the ground. I would also have panic attacks and mental breakdowns whenever I saw her again as even tho I changed school we still lived in the same general area. One time I was confronted by her boyfriend and he punched me in the face causing me to fall to the ground in the parking lot of the grocery store this was a year after the incident at that point. My own mother even said I couldn't be mad at her as since she was a girl in her own words ""I don't care what she did to you shes a women"" I wish I was joking. 2 years later and ive ran into her in public a few more times each time causes my PTSD and anxiety to act up causing me to go into a full blown panic attack. 2 years later and I'm still suffering from PTSD anxiety and severe depression from the incident. I recently downloaded discord but I signed into a old account and found the DMs my ex broke up with me with. This was enough to send me into a anxiety so bad I felt like I was gonna pass out me being an idiot reread all of them from start to end. 

Its left me with no friends no one to turn too my self esteem is practically nonexistent and the one person I loved more then anyone else on earth fucked me over in one of the worst ways possible and honestly I just don't see the point in life anyone I feel like my life is a waste like no ones ever gonna love me and I'm such a little bitch that just reading old DM messages is enough to set my anxiety and PTSD off I want her out of my life and out of my mind and I feel like deaths the only way to accomplish this I need someone to love someone who cares I don't know what else to

Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening
BY ROBERT FROST

Whose woods these are I think I know.   
His house is in the village though;   
He will not see me stopping here   
To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

My little horse must think it queer   
To stop without a farmhouse near   
Between the woods and frozen lake   
The darkest evening of the year.   

He gives his harness bells a shake   
To ask if there is some mistake.   
The only other sound’s the sweep   
Of easy wind and downy flake.   

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
But I have promises to keep,   
And miles to go before I sleep,

I never got much attention back ever he became the one my parents baby he has gotten in so much trouble far more then I ever did yet he is still the one they tell me I need to be more like. He’s done so many things on his own that have made me grow to hate him in more then a way siblings should yet they want me to model after him.

This is happening since 8 years,"2011. We met during college time. Those wild, carefree days when everything was a possibility and my heart was unbroken still. 

She was the prettiest girl I'd ever seen. And once we started talking, I found out that she was fun to spend time with too. Intelligent and sexy. But she had a boyfriend. And I knew my limits and kept my distance. 

They broke up. She and I got close. We had our moments of lust, love and general fun. We dated. We broke up thrice over a period of 10 months of being together. Multiple fights, tears, restless nights, fervent prayers. Most of the times from my side more than hers. Jealous friends surrounded us all the time, her ex boyfriend butted in throughout to ruin things for us and well, she herself wasn't very helpful because of her second guessing her emotions or falling for other guys in my class. 

We broke up for the last time and I thought we'd get back again. College was over, there was no scope of meeting her again. So this breakup was easy for her. And well, we haven't met or spoken to each other since. This was just a brief overview of the turbulent relationship.

Now, the issue -

I was deeply, madly, truly in love with her. Heads over heels, suicidally, self destructively in love with her. I'd go crazy when she's around and crazier when she's not. I gave it all my heart and soul. She was the love of my life, mother of my kids, my lobster. And every few days she made me feel like a nobody. While eventually, I did feel like a nobody. When she didn't return. 

I kept all her memories with me. Her cards, gifts, letters. I have her pics and texts on cloud. There's a blog with articles about my memories of her. I've had several relationships after her but I guess I still love her. Deep down I want her back. 

I am able to hold my conscious self back and I distract myself with every other thought in the day time. But no matter what I do, there comes a time, one night in a period of 6 months, where she creeps up on me in my dreams. I am sleeping, innocently, having been a good boy in the day and waiting for the new day to come, while she visits me in my sleep. And well, it's messed up. 

I remember exactly how she looks like, even after 8 years and not having seen her since. I remember her long, flowy hair, her dark eyes, the three dots near her left eye, her thick eyebrows, her smile, her perfect teeth. I remember her voice and how she sounds. And the dream no longer feels like a dream. It feels so damn real. 

We have fun in the dream. The dreams are pleasant, sweet and she's always smiling in it. She's always mine in that dream. And when I wake up, usually I'm jolted back to reality, I get a shock of my life realising that it was just a dream. And now I'm back to reality. A reality without her. Where I've not heard from her since 8 years.

Why do the dreams seem so real? Why is she still stuck in my head? Why do I like these dreams and wait for them to happen? Why can't I conjure her in my dreams at will and enter a lucid dreaming state? Why can't I conjure her in my real life?

She has taught me how to stay apart from someone you love, how to walk away from a perfectly healthy relationship, how to hate someone. She has taught me to live alone. The heartbreak gave way to art, I write better now. And yet, she visits me at night, challenges my grasp on reality and puts my love to test. 

I have proven that I love you. It's your turn to come back and say that 8 years was just a phase. And now you're back again.",scorpioron,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jh1agl/this_is_happening_since_8_years/,2011 met college time wild carefree day everything wa possibility heart wa unbroken still wa prettiest girl ever seen started talking found wa fun spend time intelligent sexy boyfriend knew limit kept distance broke got close moment lust love general fun dated broke thrice period 10 month together multiple fight tear restless night fervent prayer time side jealous friend surrounded u time ex boyfriend butted throughout ruin thing u well helpful second guessing emotion falling guy class broke last time thought get back college wa wa scope meeting breakup wa easy well met spoken since wa brief overview turbulent relationship issue wa deeply madly truly love head heel suicidally self destructively love go crazy around crazier gave heart soul wa love life mother kid lobster every day made feel like nobody eventually feel like nobody return kept memory card gift letter pic text cloud blog article memory several relationship guess still love deep want back able hold conscious self back distract every thought day time matter come time one night period 6 month creep dream sleeping innocently good boy day waiting new day come visit sleep well messed remember exactly look like even 8 year seen since remember long flowy hair dark eye three dot near left eye thick eyebrow smile perfect teeth remember voice sound dream longer feel like dream feel damn real fun dream dream pleasant sweet always smiling always mine dream wake usually jolted back reality get shock life realising wa dream back reality reality without heard since 8 year dream seem real still stuck head like dream wait happen conjure dream enter lucid dreaming state conjure real life ha taught stay apart someone love walk away perfectly healthy relationship hate someone ha taught live alone heartbreak gave way art write better yet visit night challenge grasp reality put love test proven love turn come back say 8 year wa phase back,happening since 8 year,scorpio ron,3506,31,scorpio ron 2011 met college time wild carefree day everything wa possibility heart wa unbroken still wa prettiest girl ever seen started talking found wa fun spend time intelligent sexy boyfriend knew limit kept distance broke got close moment lust love general fun dated broke thrice period 10 month together multiple fight tear restless night fervent prayer time side jealous friend surrounded u time ex boyfriend butted throughout ruin thing u well helpful second guessing emotion falling guy class broke last time thought get back college wa wa scope meeting breakup wa easy well met spoken since wa brief overview turbulent relationship issue wa deeply madly truly love head heel suicidally self destructively love go crazy around crazier gave heart soul wa love life mother kid lobster every day made feel like nobody eventually feel like nobody return kept memory card gift letter pic text cloud blog article memory several relationship guess still love deep want back able hold conscious self back distract every thought day time matter come time one night period 6 month creep dream sleeping innocently good boy day waiting new day come visit sleep well messed remember exactly look like even 8 year seen since remember long flowy hair dark eye three dot near left eye thick eyebrow smile perfect teeth remember voice sound dream longer feel like dream feel damn real fun dream dream pleasant sweet always smiling always mine dream wake usually jolted back reality get shock life realising wa dream back reality reality without heard since 8 year dream seem real still stuck head like dream wait happen conjure dream enter lucid dreaming state conjure real life ha taught stay apart someone love walk away perfectly healthy relationship hate someone ha taught live alone heartbreak gave way art write better yet visit night challenge grasp reality put love test proven love turn come back say 8 year wa phase back happening since 8 year

Trying to keep my head above water,"As of this year 2020 has been a really hard year. I'm (32m) going through a divorce, I thought everything was going well. However when we were around her family they would always make very subtle hints towards divorce. They poison dripped our marriage. Come to find out after being together for 8 years, she would tell her parents everything about me and all the vulnerable things that happened to myself during my childhood. I lost all trust for her after that, I tried so hard to get past that but I couldn't, I kept telling her things that I'd want to do together with just her and I and then her father would be talking about it. So I just couldn't do anything alone with her, her parents always had to be around. They are super codependent on my stbxw and she is a very passive person who loves to please people. I ended up being forced out of our house and was homeless for awhile, found a place. Her parents are living with her now. Should have never wasted my life with that person. She would never stand up for me or our marriage against her family. It's just really bothering me because we we're compatible until her toxic family fucked up everything. Anyways I'm definitely depressed, I'm broken, she blames me for everything. I literally hate myself, I just lost my job to make this year much better than it already is, of course Im looking for another job considering I don't want to be homeless again. Am I suicidal? No more than any other human in my situation. I talk to people who don't know me out in the world that don't know anything about me like nothing is wrong, happy and smiling but in reality I'm just trying to figure out how stay alive.

Rant: my depression/low self esteem has penetrated even my fantasies,"For better or worse, I often daydream/fantasize (not in a sexual way) about relationships to soothe myself at night/relax for sleep.

But lately my low self esteem has permeated those fantasies as well. I no longer can put my mind in that place because romance and succeeding at relationships seems so impossible with who I am. I wont even let myself go there in my daydreams.

"I'm tired of being a failure, but I'm even more tired of trying to fix it","I'm just really tired.

I'm tired of drifting in and out of university, rarely ever being able to pass classes. But I have to keep trying because I'll be in an extra $15k debt (grants turn to debts when you drop out) with nothing to show for it. I'm on what will probably be my last chance with student loans right now, and I'm blowing it.

I'm blowing it because that's just what I do now. University was easy for a while, but then I started to struggle to cope with my gender. I've started sorting that out, but now I struggle to cope with having struggled to cope for so long. I've failed/withdrawn from so many classes.

I've tried not being in school. I've worked minimum-wage jobs because that's all I'm good for. I got fired from one and quit the other one to go back to school. I was actually pretty good at that second job but I hated it so much. I don't know what it's like to enjoy working.

I should feel lucky that I have a partner that I live with, and friends who seem to like me well enough. But I'm tired of trying to be a better person for them. I'm failing at that, so badly. It doesn't affect my friends much right now since we're all isolated from each other anyway, but it's messing my partner up. We both live with her boyfriend (poly stuff) since we couldn't afford living on our own, and I can't seem to make it work. I seem to have developed a bit of an anxiety/aversion to men, and I don't like leaving my room. Not to mention that I don't want to leave my room because I can't handle all the germs that I can't account for outside of it. My germaphobia was always a problem, but it's starting to become unmanagable. My wrists are cracked from dousing them in alcohol all the time (soap's not enough any more).

I'm trying to eat healthily, but I haven't left the house in over a week. I don't go outside. I barely move, really. I just don't have the energy to do anything any more. I need to get my overdue assignments done, and I'm running out of time. But I just can't fucking focus. I just can't do it. And when I try to, I get scared of screwing up my assignment. I get scared of being too stupid to figure out my animation programming coding or I'm scared of not being woke enough to write a reflection on gender in Indigenous culture. I'm sure it'd be fine if I just tried but I can't and I hate it.

I can't even waste time properly. I want to play video games, but I keep telling myself I'm going to get work done, so I just surf the Internet. I want to learn about Italian cooking, but I can't focus on the video I watch, and I know that if I tried cooking anything right now I'd start panicking and give up.

A couple of months ago, I was finding reading gay romance comics and shit was making me feel better, and it was helping me feel invested in being a good partner. Watching architecture videos gave me motivation to do better in life so that maybe some day I'll be able to do better than minimum-wage work for a company I actively despise. But it's not helping any more. Nothing's making me feel better and the suicidal thoughts are coming back. They're not all I can think about, but they're coming.

I tried shaving my legs tonight and it was almost nice... But I just feel too shitty otherwise for it to make a difference. I've been eating edibles for the past day or so trying to see if I can just feel anything, but they're not even affecting me. Which is strange, 'cause I'm usually extremely sensitive to weed. I don't know; maybe they're no good. But let's be honest, weed wouldn't help either... And I don't even feel like drinking, which is really unusual for me.

My sleep schedule is so fucked right now lol. I keep trying to reset it but because I'm not going outside my circadian rhythm is so confused. I woke up at 7 PM last night and will probably stay up to about 5PM. Which might temporarily help but it'll just go out of phase again.

I don't know sorry about the incoherent post. I don't even really have a point here I just feel generally shitty and I'm just so tired of it. I'm tired of being scared of everything, and I'm tired of having such fleeting moments of feeling good. I'm tired of finding everything gross. I'm tired of being too scared of germs to clean anything, leading to a messy house. I want a clean house. I want to do my schoolwork. I want to set up my electronic drums and keyboard and clean my trumpet and flute and find my bodhran beater and actually fucking learn to use a DAW and record some music but I just don't have the energy and feel like I'll be embarrassed of whatever I make anyway. Fuck I'd be fine to just play some damn video games but I can't even bring myself to do that. I'm just fucking done.

Advice to fill the time waiting for a therapist?,"Hey all, new poster here so please let me know if I'm following wrong protocol/breaking any rules. 

I was diagnosed (on my birthday of all days) with both anxiety disorder and depression. I have been struggling for multiple months after my loved one left me (amongst a variety of other reasons also). I sought out help only after I had a bad moment where I couldn't bring myself to eat a meal for 11 days. It was awful and I vow to never return to being that bad or worse. I am on Citalopram and have been for just coming on a month but I'm still not noticing any changes in my mood. Recently (the last few days) have been particularly rough and I've been feeling even worse than when I was prescribed the antideppressants. I told this to my doc and she basically ignored me. I've been struggling with both getting to sleep and getting good rest due to my anxiety too so this isn't helping. 

I recently referred myself to a mental health services organization to see a therapist (free on UK healthcare thank god) but I have been given a 5 week waiting time before my initial appointment. 

I'm looking for any general advice or ways to keep myself busy and keep in a healthy mindset and keep motivated in the time leading up to my appointment.

I just can’t stop feeling depressed,"I recently moved from one school to another, i left all my friends there, while I was still going to school in my home town, I’d have those thought about “what if they all secretly hate me?” But I never thought it would be true.
Now that I live somewhere else and go to a different school, none of them have contacted me, I feel forgotten about and discarded. I’ve asked a few of them how it’s been, and then we have the typical talk of, “what’s it like there?” “Well back here it’s blah blah blah” and then after that, no contact with them again, not even a “hey” or “how’s it going?”.
Not to mention, this whole virus stuff makes it harder to make any friends, and I’m very anti-social, I don’t know how to talk to people, and talking to people is scary.
On top of that, my online friends have started to just drift away, we play and talk less, like they’re avoiding me.
My family isn’t good either, so I can’t even rely on them for support.
I feel so drained all the time, just seeing a decent family connection in a tv show makes me cry and want to just sleep and never wake up.
I guess I’m just rambling, nobody probably cares, I mean, it seems like everyone leaves me anyway, so there must be something wrong with me.

Having trouble getting over regret,"Hi guys. I had a mental breakdown in July 2019 that hasn't subsided.

I've never really gone to a brick and mortal school before. I've either homeschooled or online schooled for pretty much my entire life. because of this, I was and still am super sheltered

Anyway, in 2019, I kinda became aware that the world was bigger than my bedroom. I became aware that other people had friends and got to explore different interests and clubs and stuff. Now, as I plan to go to college after covid-19 subsides, I can't help but feel like I missed out.

Like, I'm still 13 socially if that makes any sense. I'm terrified of anyone remotely my own age, I have no idea of to do social interaction.

What I'm trying to say is, I'm afraid I missed out, I'm afraid college won't ever be able to make up for that, and I worry that I'm ""broken"" if that makes any sense.",hellotounderground,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jh3mpy/having_trouble_getting_over_regret/,hi guy mental breakdown july 2019 subsided never really gone brick mortal school either homeschooled online schooled pretty much entire life wa still super sheltered anyway 2019 kinda became aware world wa bigger bedroom became aware people friend got explore different interest club stuff plan go college covid 19 subsides help feel like missed like still 13 socially make sense terrified anyone remotely age idea social interaction trying say afraid missed afraid college ever able make worry broken make sense,trouble getting regret,hello underground,852,34,hello underground hi guy mental breakdown july 2019 subsided never really gone brick mortal school either homeschooled online schooled pretty much entire life wa still super sheltered anyway 2019 kinda became aware world wa bigger bedroom became aware people friend got explore different interest club stuff plan go college covid 19 subsides help feel like missed like still 13 socially make sense terrified anyone remotely age idea social interaction trying say afraid missed afraid college ever able make worry broken make sense trouble getting regret

I’m such a miserable person and it’s nobody’s fault but mine,"I just realized recently how miserable I am.

It’s just how I am. It’s like I don’t know how to be happy.

I wish for things I don’t have but also don’t take the initiative to make them happen because I’m afraid I’ll fail or be judged.

How stupid is that? If I want something out of life (as long as it’s not putting other people in danger of course) why shouldn’t I just go for it?

I wish I’d stop holding myself back and just be brave. Who cares how people perceive me? People will judge me anyways.

I wish I could stop overthinking and just LIVE.

I’m looking back at my life and regretting all the things I didn’t do.

I wanna have the life that I’ve dreamed of. Thinking of it won’t allow me to relax.

I'm alone,"Im sorry if this is too long....

I've never saw a problem with being alone before. I was raised to solve problems on my own(I didnt have a choice really). 

Now, it is hard to ask for help in life. I love my family, but we are very distant, we never sat around the table and asked each other about our day. We hardly see each other some weeks, but this part is normal. 

What I'm trying to get at is ....idk how to ask for help. I was never tought how to or if its even okay and lately I feel like there isn't reason to life and usually i get pass this feeling or simply i ignore it but I can't anymore.  I just realized how lonely I am. Like there is no reason for me to even be here. Even if I can get rid of this feeling, for what? I have no one. Being social was something I never got good i was never tought how to  so my circle is very small and I could never ask for help. 

I just feel so alone and I just dont have anyone to share life with.  I used to see a therapist they diagnosed me with MDD and BPD. But i felt like I couldn't even ask her for help, she was great, its just i felt like I had to do it on my own.

I know i did this to myself and probably still doing it to myself.

Realization,"I've just come out of a ""whirlwind"" relationship with a narcissist. I've realized that I've been depressed for the entirety of the relationship, from the very first time she discarded me. I let her come back because she was pregnant with my child. Now I'm here alone, while she falls for someone else. While this hurts, the true thing that is killing me is that I never recovered from the first discard. I never forgave her. I've been angry and depressed for 3 years. 

I wanted her to leave, badly. I knew she was holding me back from my future. So now that she's left, I'm broken. But I'm realizing it was because she was distracting me from my very broken heart that never healed. She discarded me for other men 2 more times. This has no reflection on who I am, as I know I'm a good man with many talents and a great heart. I'm a great father. I have a great job. But I can't help but feel like I'm none of the things I worked so hard to become. 

She was merely a distraction. It doesn't matter who she is, she could be anyone. I let her come back to distract myself from the hell inside. I'm mad I let someone do that to me so many times. I feel embarrassed and ashamed, like it betrayed who I truly am.

What do I do?,"Heya. Y'all can call me (23 male) DJ. :3 I'm.... Feeling quite bad to be perfectly honest. I don't know if this is a legit thing to be upset about or if I'm just overthinking things, but here's the stitch. I'm really starting to feel left out of the group of friends I have. It's happened to me before and since I wasn't very emotional of a person back then, I didn't really care. Now however, one specific person has given me reason to be more expressive and emotional, and that's my current girlfriend (20 female). She actually makes me care and life, where as before it was just.... There. We used to hang out a lot; we would call while I'm at work (I work at a place where I can be on the phone while I work), I would text her while she's at work, etc. This went the same for her roommate who she's best friends with, and I'm good friends with as well. We're all good friends... But an introduction to another person in our friend group made it a bit worse for me. Now, don't get me wrong. This dude is awesome! He's super happy all the time, very supportive of everyone, and makes people laugh. I have NOTHING against him in the slightest. It's just... Well, all they do is hang with him now. Like literally always. And that would again be fine if not for one thing. It's only with him. They don't invite me to hang anymore; I just sorta find out when I find them in a discord call (As a side note, he and I live on the east side of the US and they live in Canada). There are never messages in out little server inviting us all to hang in call with each other. They just dm him and ask him to hang with them. This has gone on for some time, but only today did it really hurt. They added a new channel to the server; 'game night', and all three of them were in it. I didn't know about it at all, but found out upon opening the server to play a little game on a bot. I don't like intruding on people, but I wanted in on this little game, so I joined in. Immediately my gf said ""You can't join!"" It didn't sound angry at all, made sense (I'm at work, so I technically can't PLAY any games with them, but I can still chat/listen to them) and I feel like her discord cut out something important cuz she stopped abruptly and she was silent for a bit, but it did hurt to hear. Still, I held onto the hope that she didn't mean that and got cut off. So I waited til my break, figuring that she would invite me to hang with them then since they all know for sure when I go on break, Aaaaaaaaand... Nothing. Now, I could have just joined back again now that I'm on break, but my mind just won't let me. I'm just thinking that if they wanted me to join, they would have invited me to when my break started. They're still in the call now, and I'm 23 minutes into me break. Am I overthinking things?

Think I might be depressed,Hi I’m an 18 year old guy. Parents have been divorced since i was young and they always lived on opposite sides of the country so I’ve always had to deal with that shit. People always try to get me to go to church but I just don’t believe in any of that BS. I played sports in high school which was fine but i wasn’t like a stand out athlete or anything. I have 4 close friends but only 2 of them aren’t always busy and smoking weed or drinking beer is our hobby. I’m attending college and have a job. Everything seems cool with me but I just always feel empty. I smoke or drink only occasionally now because I realized it just makes me feel good for a little while then I just feel like shit again. Even after stopping I still always feel that way. The more I think about it the worse it gets. I’ve imagined myself having all the money in the world and I still wouldn’t be fulfilled.

I became a burden so I never tell anything anymore.,"I made a 4th account just so she doesn't know. I've never really told anyone things about me, no one even knows I actually get sad, but she did. It was a friend I had, yet she's older than me and on a different continent. She doesn't know me, yet knows almost all my secrets, she helped me through times, yet unintentionally have caused a few.

Over time I stopped telling her things, I noticed it affected her to. It reached a point I just wouldn't even tell her about things like my own selfharm or suicide attempts, not a message stating that I did it or anything, just vanishing from her and everything. Eventually I became a burden to her, and she admitted later that it became too much to have to deal with my problems. So I've kept everything to myself again, she thinks I'm doing fine, but that's only because I simply can't tell her anything anymore.

I'm slowly killing myself and I can't stop,"In January, I was fairly optimistic about my year. My main objective was losing weight. I've been obese all my life, I thought it was time to seriously tackle this issue. I've chosen a physical activity I like, swimming, to increase my chances of overcoming my sedentariness. It took me two months to deal with the fact that people at the pool would see my body in  speedos, but I finally started doing it in March. Then corona hit and the pools were closed.

I was more active and losing weight by March. In June, I had gained almost 25 pounds and was feeling ill. I went to the doctor, did some blood tests, and I was now diabetic. Doctor said it could be reversed if I applied myself in lifestyle changes besides medication. At first, I did. I lost some 10 pounds.

For the past few weeks, though, I lost my will to fight the disease. I regained all the weight. I'm eating stuff I was not supposed to. In truth, I want to kill myself and I know I'm doing it slowly but surely by eating junk and sugar. Every time I binge on candy, I know I'm doing it to make my obesity and my diabetes worse. I'm just waiting for the heart attack or the stroke, which may be near. I really want to die.

Something inside me still makes me take the diabetes meds every day. I don't know why, but it's like I'm trying to pace the rate at which I'm dying. But I have less and less hope every day. I feel like stopping all my treatments, therapy and psychiatrist included. I feel alone, I'm pushing people away — I had a big fight with some friends recently —, and I want to die. I don't have a job, my existence is a burden I impose on everyone I have ever met.

I wish I could lose a lot of weight before dying, though. It'd make it easier to carry my body, cremation would require less materials. Even in death I'll be a nuisance.",ropeserif,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jgsr8w/im_slowly_killing_myself_and_i_cant_stop/,january wa fairly optimistic year main objective wa losing weight obese life thought wa time seriously tackle issue chosen physical activity like swimming increase chance overcoming sedentariness took two month deal fact people pool would see body speedos finally started march corona hit pool closed wa active losing weight march june gained almost 25 pound wa feeling ill went doctor blood test wa diabetic doctor said could reversed applied lifestyle change besides medication first lost 10 pound past week though lost fight disease regained weight eating stuff wa supposed truth want kill know slowly surely eating junk sugar every time binge candy know make obesity diabetes worse waiting heart attack stroke may near really want die something inside still make take diabetes med every day know like trying pace rate dying le le hope every day feel like stopping treatment therapy psychiatrist included feel alone pushing people away big fight friend recently want die job existence burden impose everyone ever met wish could lose lot weight dying though make easier carry body cremation would require le material even death nuisance,slowly killing stop,rope serif,1816,42,rope serif january wa fairly optimistic year main objective wa losing weight obese life thought wa time seriously tackle issue chosen physical activity like swimming increase chance overcoming sedentariness took two month deal fact people pool would see body speedos finally started march corona hit pool closed wa active losing weight march june gained almost 25 pound wa feeling ill went doctor blood test wa diabetic doctor said could reversed applied lifestyle change besides medication first lost 10 pound past week though lost fight disease regained weight eating stuff wa supposed truth want kill know slowly surely eating junk sugar every time binge candy know make obesity diabetes worse waiting heart attack stroke may near really want die something inside still make take diabetes med every day know like trying pace rate dying le le hope every day feel like stopping treatment therapy psychiatrist included feel alone pushing people away big fight friend recently want die job existence burden impose everyone ever met wish could lose lot weight dying though make easier carry body cremation would require le material even death nuisance slowly killing stop
How do you cope with overwhelming thoughts of mortality/inevitable death?,"Disclaimer, I do not mean this in a suicidal way. But rather, just knowing there’s an end to all of this and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. It doesn’t hit me all the time, but occasionally I’ll be scrolling through Reddit or Instagram and see some pressing question relating to death or dying, or see a post of memory of a loved one. And it hits me hard and feels unbearable. I tend to dwell on it for hours once it happens (like currently). It causes the deepest pit in my stomach and fills my head with chaos and helplessness. And I’m tired of constantly struggling with this, yet it keeps coming back. How do you cope with this?

Head Pressure and SAD/Manic Symptoms,"Hello all. Starting last Saturday and maybe even before that, when I started feeling the seasons change I noticed some bouts of irrational thoughts, depression, and anxiety start to creep in. Ever since then I have been very up and down.. Going 12 hours or so feeling pretty good, and then getting hit with waves of depression and anxiety that last for 6-8 hours or so.. Throughout the summer I was feeling great and driving all over town listening to music and singing and sharing videos with my friends, etc.. 

It seems to be accompanied by this bizarre head pressure that I thought was sinus pressure, but it feels like more than that.. It seems to be directly on top of my head..

Last winter I came off of Suboxone and had SEVERE depression and panic attacks.. so severe I went to the emergency room like 5 or 6 times.. I ended up going to treatment on April 4th, and I was feeling pretty good for all of the 5 months I was in treatment and had amazing time connecting with the other men there, and stuff.

Does this sound like SAD or Manic Depression? How can it be that I would go 5 months feeling pretty solid, working out with my buddies, laughing, joking, etc.. and now this? Does anybody know what the head pressure could be? I'm feeling really scared and hopeless that I could feel the way I felt when I came off suboxone last winter..",fatstrat123,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jgztzh/head_pressure_and_sadmanic_symptoms/,hello starting last saturday maybe even started feeling season change noticed bout irrational thought depression anxiety start creep ever since going 12 hour feeling pretty good getting hit wave depression anxiety last 6 8 hour throughout summer wa feeling great driving town listening music singing sharing video friend etc seems accompanied bizarre head pressure thought wa sinus pressure feel like seems directly top head last winter came suboxone severe depression panic attack severe went emergency room like 5 6 time ended going treatment april 4th wa feeling pretty good 5 month wa treatment amazing time connecting men stuff doe sound like sad manic depression would go 5 month feeling pretty solid working buddy laughing joking etc doe anybody know head pressure could feeling really scared hopeless could feel way felt came suboxone last winter,head pressure sad manic symptom,fat strat 123,1348,36,fat strat 123 hello starting last saturday maybe even started feeling season change noticed bout irrational thought depression anxiety start creep ever since going 12 hour feeling pretty good getting hit wave depression anxiety last 6 8 hour throughout summer wa feeling great driving town listening music singing sharing video friend etc seems accompanied bizarre head pressure thought wa sinus pressure feel like seems directly top head last winter came suboxone severe depression panic attack severe went emergency room like 5 6 time ended going treatment april 4th wa feeling pretty good 5 month wa treatment amazing time connecting men stuff doe sound like sad manic depression would go 5 month feeling pretty solid working buddy laughing joking etc doe anybody know head pressure could feeling really scared hopeless could feel way felt came suboxone last winter head pressure sad manic symptom

I’m married to someone who is depressed and I need help understanding it.,"My husband left a toxic workplace because it was bringing his depression back. He’s rebuilding himself and organizing the house for the purpose of re-entering a new job with confidence. I’m 100% supportive of this. Our finances are stable and I would rather him put his mental health first. 

But let’s get to it. I’m self motivated and have no problem finding things to do. 

He feels lonely because I’m not home and works well when he has company. Since I’m the only one working, I can’t be home except later in the afternoon. As a result, he doesn’t feel motivated to do anything when he’s by himself. 

That’s what I’m struggling to understand. I know it isn’t laziness. I just don’t fully understand why he doesn’t feel motivated to work around the house more. Some days he does, some days he doesn’t. I’m also trying to figure out what I can do to help motivate him even if I’m not there. 


We also got into a bit of a spat this morning. We keep things civil, no cussing or name calling. I admitted my mistake (leaving the grill uncovered and forgetting about the storm) and called him out on some behavior I didn’t like. Dishes not being done when he said they were, being laughed at over not covering the grill at 5:30 in the morning. 

 He apologized and then shut down. Doesn’t want to talk to me or interact. Just wants to be left alone and I have no idea how long this is going to last. Longest was two days. I know this isn’t about me, but I feel like I should admit that it was really hard being without my best friend for two days. I took it really hard and spent those days crying and doing my best to keep it together at work. 

When your depression hits, why do you feel a complete lack of motivation? Do you feel tired? When you’re alone, does it get worse? 

I’m afraid this is going to last longer and I have no one to turn to. It’s become more frequent because my parents and his parents keep pointing out that he doesn’t have a job yet, amp other reasons.

Lost my job this spring and now I'm feeling worse than ever,"I've been depressed  my entire adult life, and been struggling with social anxiety for as long as I can remember. Cant say that I've really achieved anything noteworthy during my lifetime(27 year old male). I did finish my bachelor's degree about two years ago, which at least gave some sort of joy and hope for the future. By doing that I proved to myself that I am capabable of seeing something through, instead of just dropping out and etching my education down as yet another in a long list of failures.

I landed my first job last October. It was actually the first job I had ever applied for, and it was in a field that suited my profile. However, it also involved ALOT of contact with small children and parents. The first of which I'm not a huge fan of. The place I worked was also located far away from my hometown. Which meant I had to get up at about 5 AM every morning to take a one and a half hour train ride, while also having to change trains in another city. The whole thing was a struggle. But I did what I could and went to work every morning. Only calling in sick two or three times due to being physically ill, not because of my mental health.

Anyway, about six months pass and  I'm called in to my bosses office. She told me that they weren't planning on extending my employment there(I had a six month probation period) . In a way I wasn't that surprised. I had underperformed. Partially because working so closely with children isn't really my cup of tea. And that sadly shone through in my work. So I do take the blame for that. But I'm also bitter over the fact that I got no real introduction during my time there. I was sort of left to my own devices. Having to figure out a lot of things by myself, or having my supervisor only pointing out stuff i was doing wrong, without having explained what I was supposed to be doing in the first place. So yeah, the lack of guidance didn't help.

As much I hated the job itself, or at least parts of it,  I do miss some of my colleagues.  It was actually a nice working environment. And I do feel I did do some good things while I was there, though my supervisor never gave me credit for it.

Six months have passed since then and I'm more depressed than I'v been in a looong time. My sleeping schedule is totally off. I mostly just lay in bed all day. Letting the memories from my former workplace fill my head 24/7. Imagining what could have been if I had done a better job. Either that or  just ruminating over the fact that I'm an incompetent slob that will never amount to anything.",Mozzer93,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jh2xso/lost_my_job_this_spring_and_now_im_feeling_worse/,depressed entire adult life struggling social anxiety long remember cant say really achieved anything noteworthy lifetime 27 year old male finish bachelor degree two year ago least gave sort joy hope future proved capabable seeing something instead dropping etching education yet another long list failure landed first job last october wa actually first job ever applied wa field suited profile however also involved alot contact small child parent first huge fan place worked wa also located far away hometown meant get 5 every morning take one half hour train ride also change train another city whole thing wa struggle could went work every morning calling sick two three time due physically ill mental health anyway six month pas called boss office told planning extending employment six month probation period way surprised underperformed partially working closely child really cup tea sadly shone work take blame also bitter fact got real introduction time wa sort left device figure lot thing supervisor pointing stuff wa wrong without explained wa supposed first place yeah lack guidance help much hated job least part miss colleague wa actually nice working environment feel good thing wa though supervisor never gave credit six month passed since depressed v looong time sleeping schedule totally mostly lay bed day letting memory former workplace fill head 24 7 imagining could done better job either ruminating fact incompetent slob never amount anything,lost job spring feeling worse ever,ozz er 93,2556,59,ozz er 93 depressed entire adult life struggling social anxiety long remember cant say really achieved anything noteworthy lifetime 27 year old male finish bachelor degree two year ago least gave sort joy hope future proved capabable seeing something instead dropping etching education yet another long list failure landed first job last october wa actually first job ever applied wa field suited profile however also involved alot contact small child parent first huge fan place worked wa also located far away hometown meant get 5 every morning take one half hour train ride also change train another city whole thing wa struggle could went work every morning calling sick two three time due physically ill mental health anyway six month pas called boss office told planning extending employment six month probation period way surprised underperformed partially working closely child really cup tea sadly shone work take blame also bitter fact got real introduction time wa sort left device figure lot thing supervisor pointing stuff wa wrong without explained wa supposed first place yeah lack guidance help much hated job least part miss colleague wa actually nice working environment feel good thing wa though supervisor never gave credit six month passed since depressed v looong time sleeping schedule totally mostly lay bed day letting memory former workplace fill head 24 7 imagining could done better job either ruminating fact incompetent slob never amount anything lost job spring feeling worse ever
A guy I met in a PS4 game voicechat lobby ghosted me,"I met him a fortnite battle royale squads game, there was 4 of us randoms playing but only me and him had mics.
I said hi as soon as it started like I always do, he said hi back.
I dont usually talk much in the games to begin with, I only even have a mic because it makes me feel a little less alone to hear people talking.

He was oddly charming as soon as he started talking, like when we both got in the car and he started driving and there was a song playing on the radio, he started singing along lol and was like ""I'm the only one that likes this song?"" I was like ""I do"" 

It's weird he never asked for my age, but I have a very young sounding voice but I'm literally a 22 yearold girl, I sound like I'm 10.

At some point in the game I told him I was 22, because he told me he was 31, after he told me his age he then said ""lots of people lie about their age, but I'm not ashamed""

Many things happened during this night that I met him, including the fact that he asked for my cellphone number at some point during me and him playing.
He called me after too, and kept telling me that I was an ""amazing beautiful person""

Also at some point in the game I told him i was molested as a child, I don't want sympathy, but he kept insisting that I have ""trust issues"" in the game, he kept telling me his last name in the game *which I dont believe is true*
Then he would ask my first name and middle name and last name, but in parts.

God he was so charming

I felt really close to him, like he cared about me
After he pestered me about my ""trust issues""
He said he has a psychology bachelors, and then I said wow that's impressive""
He said that maybe me and him were meant to meet that night

The thing hurts me is that I google reverse traced his photo and it was fake, he asked for my photo of my face and I gave it to him.
Funny enough he didnt believe my actual photo was me,
I sent him 2 face photos.

I even said ""hey maybe we can snapchat so I can prove to you it's me by snapping my face?""
He didnt want too, I'm sure Its because he didn't want to show his real face to me.

The thing here it was never sexual, it was just so weird, it wasnt love either 

It felt like I knew him my whole life but I just ignored him because I didnt believe he was real

That night he spoke to me on the phone he kept telling me that I should live, and live for myself, and that I'm ""too nice of a person"" to let my rapist make me feel like shit, he said I can live and have the life I want if I try.
I never told him I was depressed, but maybe he just assumed.

He sounded like he was going to cry on the phone that night, he said ""you're not saying anything"" I said ""what do I even say?""
He was like ""say you'll be a strong person""

He deleted me off the game app and stopped texting me, I think he did a final goodbye, he said that he hopes I get what i want from life and that I'll eventually be happy

Why did he send a fake photo?
Why did he ghost me?
If he sent me a fake photo then what else did he say about himself was a lie?",anongirllost,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jh2xmt/a_guy_i_met_in_a_ps4_game_voicechat_lobby_ghosted/,met fortnite battle royale squad game wa 4 u randoms playing mics said hi soon started like always said hi back dont usually talk much game begin even mic make feel little le alone hear people talking wa oddly charming soon started talking like got car started driving wa song playing radio started singing along lol wa like one like song wa like weird never asked age young sounding voice literally 22 yearold girl sound like 10 point game told wa 22 told wa 31 told age said lot people lie age ashamed many thing happened night met including fact asked cellphone number point playing called kept telling wa amazing beautiful person also point game told wa molested child want sympathy kept insisting trust issue game kept telling last name game dont believe true would ask first name middle name last name part god wa charming felt really close like cared pestered trust issue said ha psychology bachelor said wow impressive said maybe meant meet night thing hurt google reverse traced photo wa fake asked photo face gave funny enough didnt believe actual photo wa sent 2 face photo even said hey maybe snapchat prove snapping face didnt want sure want show real face thing wa never sexual wa weird wasnt love either felt like knew whole life ignored didnt believe wa real night spoke phone kept telling live live nice person let rapist make feel like shit said live life want try never told wa depressed maybe assumed sounded like wa going cry phone night said saying anything said even say wa like say strong person deleted game app stopped texting think final goodbye said hope get want life eventually happy send fake photo ghost sent fake photo else say wa lie,guy met ps4 game voicechat lobby ghosted,girl lost,3029,52,girl lost met fortnite battle royale squad game wa 4 u randoms playing mics said hi soon started like always said hi back dont usually talk much game begin even mic make feel little le alone hear people talking wa oddly charming soon started talking like got car started driving wa song playing radio started singing along lol wa like one like song wa like weird never asked age young sounding voice literally 22 yearold girl sound like 10 point game told wa 22 told wa 31 told age said lot people lie age ashamed many thing happened night met including fact asked cellphone number point playing called kept telling wa amazing beautiful person also point game told wa molested child want sympathy kept insisting trust issue game kept telling last name game dont believe true would ask first name middle name last name part god wa charming felt really close like cared pestered trust issue said ha psychology bachelor said wow impressive said maybe meant meet night thing hurt google reverse traced photo wa fake asked photo face gave funny enough didnt believe actual photo wa sent 2 face photo even said hey maybe snapchat prove snapping face didnt want sure want show real face thing wa never sexual wa weird wasnt love either felt like knew whole life ignored didnt believe wa real night spoke phone kept telling live live nice person let rapist make feel like shit said live life want try never told wa depressed maybe assumed sounded like wa going cry phone night said saying anything said even say wa like say strong person deleted game app stopped texting think final goodbye said hope get want life eventually happy send fake photo ghost sent fake photo else say wa lie guy met ps4 game voicechat lobby ghosted
Feels like I can’t control anything (11th grade and personal life crisis),"I’m writing this because I feel so fucking hopeless tonight and I feel like my peak years of happiness is wasted away because of factors I could never control or are out of my control now. This life has fucked me in too many ways imaginable. 

I’m in marching band and tonight was senior night which means the people graduating this get to go out on the football field with their parents and shit at halftime. It’s extremely baffling to me that this will be happening to me in exactly one years time. I’m not ready for shit and haven’t been prepared for shit. I’ve been wanting myself to grow up and be the person I’ve wanted myself to be all my life, and ever since I graduated freshman year, I’ve just wanted to stop time and sit in it forever. It’s extremely struggling to watch time fly in front of me and see my peers getting old while I’m gonna be the most underprepared and underskilled 18 year old there could possibly be. I’m watching the people I’ve “observed” become seniors and graduating while I’m right there with them now and can’t even remind myself on basic hygiene tasks (though there’s not much point to that anyways, since I’m not dressing or cleaning myself for anyone anyways). 

And even when senior day comes and I’m forced to get out on the football field with my parents, shit, I don’t even want to do that. My parents haven’t done shit for me except remind me why I’m a lazy sack of shit and I never get a day of rest from their constant criticisms and constant reminders of why I’m not the son they hoped for. They rarely ever give me compliments and they NEVER get my morale up whatsoever. I just sit here in this fucking dirty cluttered house in my dirty cluttered room all day and wait for them to give me another criticism that I’ll never improve on and never prove to them that I improved anyways. 

Holy fuck, I feel so stuck in everything. The few friends I consider friends won’t ever message me and are busy talking to their own group chats and friends who have no idea that they exist, no one in my school gives a single fuck about me, and I have literal anuses for parents. I don’t want to be fucking 16. I wish I could be 5 or in elementary school or maybe just back in 8th grade again and actually be (slightly) outgoing and have the most innocent carefree view of the world again. But I don’t decide that and I’m not gonna be able to decide what’s gonna happen to me in the near future. I genuinely think I only have a year and a half left of my life and then I’ll just jump off the balcony of the second floor of school and pray I’ll crack my skull open and die of BFT. Nothing is ever gonna go my fucking way and there’s nothing I can do to change it. All the good luck in this world is reserved for everyone else except me and there’s nothing I can do about it. 

There’s so many other things I could talk about that’s wrong with my life but I’m sure I’m already hitting a text limit and I’ve already burdened you with massive walls of text so I’m gonna call this a post here and watch it get buried other everyone else here because thats the way it always goes in my life.

I feel like such an idiot,"Things have been really bad for me lately, in various ways, and I’ve posted about it a bit. 

I started feeling a bit better, and a little while ago I decided I would order one of those posters from Displate, especially since they had a couple of discounts going. 

So stupid me went through the whole ordering process and I didn’t notice wherever you were supposed to put in your discount codes. 

I don’t know if you can use more than one at a time, but there were two I could have used, and it looks like I could have saved at least £20. I also didn’t realise when I must have been at the final page where you confirm all your information, so I got worried about that too. 

The extra money is annoying, but it’s not a big deal. I just feel so stupid for messing it up. I didn’t even think to check where it would be shipping from and when I would receive it!

It’s a legitimate company, but I’m still annoyed at myself. I sent them a message using their website thing, and I also emailed them, and I might try contacting them on social media too. 

Their FAQ says you can’t apply discount codes ones you’ve placed the order, but that you can cancel the order, then re-order it with the codes applied. But it looks like you actually have to use that message thing to get somebody from their company to cancel the order, rather than just doing it yourself. 

The FAQ says you have 24 hours to cancel the order, but today is a Saturday and their website says their support team doesn’t work weekends. 

So I’m just... I feel so stupid. I feel like I can’t get anything right.

just sad here a story,"Hey, not 100% if it's ok to post this here, it doesn't seem to be against the rules, thanks to the community for providing this space.

I've been majorly depressed my whole life. I've had friends and been liked before and have always held down high-demanding employment, part of me is functional but, I've always felt broken. I've never had more than one or two close friends at a time and less than 5 my whole life, and I've lost all of them. Never let them see me for real.

I left the military after 4 years when I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. I am not sure how accurate that diagnosis was, I fought it at the time. I was forcibly committed twice. I never hurt anyone, I never did anything ""crazy"", but I admit I was no longer meeting my military duties and so they put me there. The worst was being lied to about it. Right up until they were walking me away from checkin and down the hall... Every single person told me I'd be fine I'd be coming home... It wasn't so bad. Military were segregated from gen pop and had stricter regiments of course but it was better. I have nightmares of it sometimes but I also miss it in some ways.

Anyway. Got out of the military. Switched career fields. Worked in a datacenter overnight for a bit, now I'm actually a developer for one of the biggest companies in the space. I worked so hard to get here. But. It doesn't mean to me now what it meant to me when I started down the path. I hate it sort of. But not because of the work just because it's not making me happy.

My wife left me almost 2 years ago. She was with someone else within a week. Divorce was finalized about half a year later. I don't blame her for leaving me, but she's hurt me a lot during the process and since. She used me for money and her sexual/emotional needs for a while and really fucked up my life. I only let her back in because how lonely and desperate I was for a friend and she knew that and. It's just hard to cope with that. I feel alienated from people most of the time. She was always different. She was my family. But she still used me that way and lied to me and took money I didn't have.

I have our two dogs now. They're 100% the reason I'm not dead. I owe them a family. I tell them Ohana every night because thats what we used to say I know its stupid. I want to die so much I can't describe it. I have equipment and plans and have done some testing to see what works. But I can't bring myself to abandon those dogs. I love them.

I cut myself every single day. Large deep cuts, my entire body is covered in scars head to toe. I use a serrated knife that has become my favorite because I like how it hurts and I it feels like the extra force needed to cut gives me a little more control with it. I've cut too deep on accident before and had some bad injuries. I don't want that when I cut I just want to help with how I feel.

Lately I think I've become addicted to downers. Clonazepam, Xanax, alcohol. Anything to not feel.

I usually work at least an 80 hour week at my job. Not that I have to. I just don't know what else I'd do with myself. Nothing feels good or happy.

My birth parents both had severe mental illnesses, my dad killed himself before I was born and I was born with a lot of drugs in my system. Spent a few years a while back tracking down my Mom, she didn't respond, didn't try again. Adoptive family has been fine, don't understand. My older sister molested me when I was younger and we've never talked about it. Told my wife in a vague way but eventually she started thinking I lied about being abused because I refused to admit who had done it.

I don't know what story I'm trying to tell. I just can't keep this inside. I don't have friends or anyone to talk to. If you want to talk back to me you can. If you want to be depressed at me I understand you can say sad things. I can't support any sort of contact but if I see someone say something I'll try and say something back.

I need help..,"so for the past 4 months I’ve been struggling with OCD. I had my first onset in July. Literally it came out of nowhere. I never dealt with OCD before in my life or really understood what it was until that point and right before that day my mental health was pretty great actually I was still anxious at times but I was nowhere near where I was years ago with my anxiety and so I thought my life was going smoothly for once. That is until OCD came to ruin my life. So I have the OCD that’s non stop intrusive thoughts- gross thoughts I don’t ever want to think about again pretty much 24/7. 

Lately it’s been okay actually way better than July. I’m eating, I’m doing some things I used to but as I am getting better I still feel somewhat depressed and I guess that’s why I’m here. I would say I feel 85% normal but I don’t have any motivation to do anything really. Even when my mood is good I just have 0 motivation to do anything remotely productive. I started slowly incorporating hobbies into my day but it’s nowhere near the level I was before OCD hit me. You see pre-OCD my life was nowhere near perfect in fact I’m 23, been unemployed since the beginning of the year, I can’t drive, and I live with my mom and my brother who is more mentally ill than me and my mom needs to take care of him 24/7. There’s a lot more to my living situation I’ll spare everyone the details it’s basically very chaotic.  But despite all this I was very capable of not only helping my mom where I could but I was mostly very positive and my mood was up most of the time. I was also studying for the GRE, I would work out, read, play my violin; I was so productive. But now even though I’m doing better with my OCD and have been going to therapy for the past 4 months I still don’t feel myself and I feel frustrated and depressed. It’s like I’m focusing on all the negatives in my life and all of a sudden I feel trapped. Not only trapped in my situation but in my own mind and body and I’m so tired of it I feel like honestly giving up.

Medication advice,"Hi I’ve posted on here couple times and wanted some input on medications. I have been on so many medications for depression, anxiety and bipolar. Last ones I was on was lamictal, lithium, ziprazidone, trazadone, dioxitine, and Xanax at low dose. They worked for bit but stopped working and got horrible side affects from the ziprazidone. I kept taking it but stopped working all together! The Xanax definitely helped me but it was low dose so after while i felt it needed to be increased, but doc didn’t want me to go any higher and didn’t want it to be on it no longer.

I moved and it was hour away to get to doctors and stupid me decided to just try to get off meds because I felt they didn’t work anyways and impossible to find another doc with my insurance. My ex told me that I was fine without meds anyways and that I was weak minded. I have to live with him for time being and we have a child together so I just toughened it out. It’s been 5 months and I’m struggling everyday! I’m depressed, social anxiety real bad, and now insomnia. I finally got a appointment with psychiatrist office, but they have nurse practitioners. Can’t find too many psychiatrists out here with my insurance. I got a primary doc to refill trazidone because I have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Took it last night really didn’t help much but better than nothing, at least until I see nurse practitioner Monday.

Feeling of emptiness in life.,"So I am 23 Male. I am well settled in my career.  I have a nice paying job.  
But i been feeling like all this is for nothing. I lost any interest in my life. Nothing exists me anymore.

This is my everyday schedule.

I wake in morning whole aparment empty. I get ready start working. All this time apartment have dead silence. It feel scary lonely sometime.  I finish my work. Then just spend my fking time somehow and sleep. I repeat this cycle from monday to friday.  
Then comes the hardest part weekends.   
Generally working people are looking forward to weekends to relax. Its depression hell for me.  


Weekends are like its Saturday 1 pm in noon. I am sitting in my chair looking at my computer and i feel like there is no meaning of doing anything. I am just counting every minute of weekend that somehow it passes. And then cycle repeat.   


Its going on like this for 3 months now i am not finding any purpose in life to continue doing this.  
Like i have worked my ass off to be where i am right now. So that i can feel this feeling of emptiness??????  


I know people have telling me find new hobbies, go out, read books etc. I know what to do to kill time.   
But the point in life is you dont have to find hobbies, you dont have to make plan and go out. It just happens. You dont have to do it to kill your loneliness. It should come naturally. I have lost interest from all the things.

I feel like I can only rely on myself and the notion of talking to others feels like a lie to me now.,"It’s now been 6 years I’ve been dealing with depression and around 2 or 3 since I’ve started posting on this sub. Having those years under my belt I’ve been able to learn what triggers my depression and why I do the things I do. I’ve also become smart enough to know what it is I need to do to be better and act like a normal person. 

It’s this knowledge that makes me feel like maybe talking to other people and getting it out just isn’t right for me. I constantly think about talking to someone only to have the conversation in my head first and pretty much be able to guess what they would say. I always know what this friend would say or what my parents would say or what a therapist would say. It shows how cookie cutter and shallow some people responses are. And even when I do talk, that’s it it’s just talk. No action, no magic cure of course not. 

So I feel like I just have to deal with depression on my own, since I’m the only one who knows me and I’m the only one who can change me. It feels shitty it really does. Because when you first start dealing with it people tell you sadness will pass but it doesn’t. You have to learn to live with depression. This is who you are and what you always will be. All I can do is go to the gym, hold a job, finish school, and pretend to be normal. I feel like those are my only options because that’s what’s been expected of me. And even then I can’t do that shit right. I’ve gained 20lbs, quit my job to “focus on school” (yeah right cause Zoom meetings and 4 page papers are sO hArD), and every time I open my mouth I just make an ass of myself to those around me. I like to think Depression turned me into this asocial pariah, but if I would to be objective I’ve probably always been like this. 

The negative thoughts never leave. They’re a part of me now and a part of how I will view the world forever. 

You can only talk to people so many times before you’ve heard it all. Why can’t these people show that kind of love when I don’t beg for it, why do I have to come out first and plead like a dog for someone to listen. This subreddit feels like the only place my thoughts have a right to be. It’s like they only care when called upon, to save face, to do what they think is right because that would be the appropriate response. It’s like everyone who isn’t depressed is a Sociopath with a mask on. It’s depressed people that are honest with emotions, that show them uncensored and unfiltered. 

And you know what it’s selfish of me to think that other people owe me some kind of love. They don’t, and no one should be obligated to love anybody. Nobody else gets their hand held through life and I’m no special case. 

This morning I tried getting a noose ready for only the second time in my life. Of course my dumbass decided to rent a bungalow and so I don’t exactly have many vaulted ceilings or tall garages to hang myself in. After that failure I just started a load of laundry, went upstairs and cried for a bit. 

My father wants me to get a CC permit but I think having the gun would be too tempting. And messy, that’s why I prefer a noose or something similar. 

Some people find comfort in understanding their depression, or knowing what they have to do. To me I feel cheated, like I was promised salvation at the end of this fight. But I think that was a lie I told myself, thinking that if I had enough faith in that idea of the depression having a solid end, that would make the struggle worth it. 

I don’t even know what normal people act like anymore. How do normal people think? What do you guys think, like I said you’re the only ones in this world who I think are honest with their emotions. I know my ideals sound maybe harsh and too nihilistic, but it’s how I feel. If I want to be honest with myself I need to say things that are harsh.

Over the Hill,"Every day that I am alive I become a worse version of myself. More lazy. More cruel. More cynical. There may be some good days here and there, every once a while, brief moments of bliss, but these are merely anomalous blips on what is, by now, a statistically irrefutable downward trajectory.

I was going to be a musician. I was going to be a novelist. I was going to meet the love of my life and escape to some charming, isolated mountain town, and start foundations, and write letters to the top minds of our generation and change things. Its easy to be fooled by your own foolish, romantic notions of who you are, or what life is, or how it should work, when you are still going uphill.

Now I look into a the mirror and see a pitful lump of flesh. A miserable, weak, broken bag of bones. A sad testament to sloth and selfishness, clinging to an undignified existence, barely able to scrape by the energy to fulfill even the most basic expectations of a functioning human being. 

It would be easy for me to blame the state of the world on turning me into the person I am. To skirt responsibility for the wreckage and dysfunction that I tend to leave in my path, to cast myself as a victim of fate, tormented by outside forces. But I am everything that is wrong with this world. I deserve more blame than many. I am not a victim to this sick experiment, I am a willing participant.

Is it depression or am I just making it seem worse than it is?,"In early August I started developing symptoms of depression for no reason whatsoever, I’ve always dealt with anxiety, and mid-late 2019 was a very particularly bad time with it. My depressive symptoms began with me just thinking that I would be better off out of this world, then I started about thinking about suicide itself and just kinda looking for ways I could accomplish it. It got very bad around late August, then in September it basically went away for about three weeks and I was once again pretty contempt with myself. Now, I feel as though my thoughts are coming back. I started looking through suicide methods again. I feel guilty using the word “depressed” here but it’s really the only way I can describe my feelings of just wanting to leave. Some things still make me happy, like spending time with friends, but when I’m just at home is when I really feel the feelings. Nothing anyone in my family is doing is causing them either.",L1qu1dHel1un,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jh0ypb/is_it_depression_or_am_i_just_making_it_seem/,early august started developing symptom depression reason whatsoever always dealt anxiety mid late 2019 wa particularly bad time depressive symptom began thinking would better world started thinking suicide kinda looking way could accomplish got bad around late august september basically went away three week wa pretty contempt feel though thought coming back started looking suicide method feel guilty using word depressed really way describe feeling wanting leave thing still make happy like spending time friend home really feel feeling nothing anyone family causing either,depression making seem worse,l 1 qu 1 hel 1 un,946,62,l 1 qu 1 hel 1 un early august started developing symptom depression reason whatsoever always dealt anxiety mid late 2019 wa particularly bad time depressive symptom began thinking would better world started thinking suicide kinda looking way could accomplish got bad around late august september basically went away three week wa pretty contempt feel though thought coming back started looking suicide method feel guilty using word depressed really way describe feeling wanting leave thing still make happy like spending time friend home really feel feeling nothing anyone family causing either depression making seem worse

My boyfriend got me worked up during a video game and now I’m having a panic attack,"I was playing Sea of Thieves, and I’m pretty new so right now I’m just trying to do some Hunters Call reputation things while getting used to the controls. Well basically I was hanging out on Mermaids Hideout with my little sloop hidden. I had collected a large amount of pig/chicken/pondies to turn in and increase my reputation. Then this galleon of pirate legends came to the island and sunk my ship. I hid in the water and managed to climb onto their ship while they were busy collecting my few things. I was looking around at their stuff and my boyfriend started paying attention and he said “Holy Crap, grab that and run” so I grabbed whatever it was (sorry I honestly didn’t stop to read the description but it was small and glowy, I think it was some sort of key) and got in the water. He said I could sell it at an outpost for a lot of money. He said I should hide it on the island so I did, then they killed me but didn’t see the key. 
Basically my boyfriend was freaking out. Telling me I need to get a rowboat and go get the key and hide it somewhere else or go to the outpost and all this other shit. It was really annoying and stressful, the pirate legends are running all over the island and I needed to stay hidden. I could hear my heartbeat loudly and I managed to hide at the top of the hill in a bush. My boyfriend was telling me to do all of these things and then he got upset and huffed and said “I’m just going to join your game.” So he did and then he continue to tell me what to do. Meanwhile every time the pirate legends killed us they would say “where’s the key??” Where’s the key?” And so we knew that they couldn’t find it. I would respawn and sail back to the island over and over, they’d kill me, sink my ship and repeat. Well my boyfriend went to go get a rowboat and then the key and saw that it was gone so they had to of found it. So he got all upset and quit the game and then they killed me and I respawned across the map and I decided to quit the game too because I had so much adrenaline in me I was panicking.

"I was an ambitous, strong student in high school. Now I'm not so sure I like the person I'm becoming in college.","I'm a first year engineering student. I'm currently in mechanical, I plan on switching into general engineering at the end of this year. I did FRC (robotics) all throughout high school, it was my whole world. I think although I enjoyed it, it was a crutch. It was a good thing for me to focus on to ignore stress. My grades were really good, there were higher scoring students, but I was still confident because I consider myself well rounded and good spirited. I loved learning and helping others. I've never been great at memorization and my high school was project based meaning we didn't have exams. I was really excited for college, eager to explore my interests and really pursue academia. I'm getting my ass kicked. I'm working so hard, the content is hard, lectures are large, and exams come fast. We're on a ten week term schedule with three sets of midterms. I am exhausted. I give myself time every day to relax, but it never feels like enough. I know that college is meant to be hard and I just have to get through it, but since I just started during a pandemic, I don't have my community yet. I've made friends, but I no longer have younger students looking up to me every day, I'm no longer tutoring, I don't get to talk to teachers every day who I have long term relationships with. None of the reminders of why I do what I love are there anymore. I'm in an academic purgatory. I don't want to sound whiny, and I'm resilient so I know I will get it together, but there's no compassion here. I'm losing my energy, my spirit, and my care. I want to get my footing. Someone telling me I'm doing enough is different than knowing myself that I'm doing enough. And knowing I'll get through it and get my energy back? That's just a hope until it happens.

I could write a book about why I’m depressed but I won’t. 

I’ve tried calling suicide hotline, but where I live it’s fucking terrible. They ask you if you need to be admitted and if you say no they say “you’re holding up the line for someone who might actually need help”.

All my friends moved away so I have no one to talk to or see. My ex won’t speak to me and she legitimately got mad at me for having these thoughts and told me to find someone else to talk to because she doesn’t want to talk to someone who doesn’t want to live.

I’m just laying in bed with a plan and thoughts, but I won’t do it no matter how much I want to. It’s kind of pathetic.

My insurance doesn’t have an inpatient facility in my area and they won’t let me go to one a few hours away because it’s not in the area of coverage. I would have to go to some bullshit crappy hospital where I live. that I will not do.

Both of my parents have depression although neither of them has done anything about it. They just go through life, fighting because they still want to be there for me and my younger brothers. I used to think that depression only had one face; sadness. So I thought that maybe I was cured but now I just feel apathetic about everything even the things that I used to love. I have fallen into a horrible cycle of low motivation and apathy that makes me miserable and I don't know how to get out of it.

Constant feeling of something being wrong please help,"I've suffered from depression/anxiety for a very long time. The last couple months I started declining in my mental health. I do everything in my power to be alone when it happens, and prefer it over being with anyone - which today is what lead me to cut off contact with my boyfriend. There's other personal reasons why it made me walk away, but most of it was due to a nagging bad feeling in my gut/stomach that has been hovering with me since January. It only ever seemed to be a major issue when I thought of my relationship or when my boyfriend was around. Some days I would get irritated quickly, even angry, and find myself in disgust at some things he did that bothered me a great deal (hygiene was a big one for me). Today has been the worst day in a long time, it just feels like the relationship was over for me and I didn't find myself attracted or wanting anything more out of it. Almost like something was pushing me towards this point, maybe I needed it? I feel cruel for even feeling this way, but my major problem is I STILL feel this nagging bad feeling in my gut.   


It feels similar to anxiety/panic but it doesn't set me off like a trigger, instead it lingers for a while and constantly comes and goes. I can't get rid of this feeling and I think I have something seriously wrong with my mentally. It's to the point where I can't stand the thought of any relationship, or people for that matter, and I'd do anything in my power to be alone. Relationships bore me, as does life itself. It's quite dull and I have no path I'm following, I have no idea what to do with myself or what's going on mentally. Considering seeing a doctor, but that would take a stupid amount of time to hit the correct diagnosis. I also get extreme depression some days where I just cry and feel hopeless about everything.

"Physically, and emotionally drained; Depression","Having suffered with clinical depression for some years, and with my mood considerably dropping these past few days, I just thought it would be nice to speak to people who understand, and to get some positive vibes flowing. 

I think the worst part about the depression hitting, is knowing not a great deal can solve it, other than being patient, and to constantly tell yourself that your mood will eventually pick back up again. Maintaining a positive thought process is not easy whilst going through it, as my mind certainly wants to be anything but positive. 

There's not many things I can put my mind too whilst feeling this way, however the 2 things which are possible, and always uplift me, even if its just a slight difference are:

Using music as a distraction, or forcing myself to go for a walk. The latter obviously being harder as being a recluse whilst being depressed go hand in hand for me.

How to deal with automatic depressive thoughts?,"Even when I'm doing anything that is not deserving of self-hatred, thoughts like ""I'm a disgusting failure. I'm a fucked up piece of shit. I screw up everything. I'm ugly, stupid, useless, and pathetic"", etc. just come to my head.

It's almost like it's like a mantra I do everyday unconsciously. I was thinking maybe it's that because I say it often, there's like a strong neural connection in my head - leading to these negative thoughts being reinforced again and again.

I don't know how to get rid of it. I try to say positive things, but I don't believe it. I know I'm worthless. It's not depression that makes me think so. I'm factually worthless, and the only way to increase my self-esteem is to start doing things - I'm in the process, so I'm not good enough yet. Anyways, those automatic depressive thoughts - it's not even about me thinking I did something wrong - I just get them so easily. I don't know how to get rid of them. It just makes me so negative.

I also constantly get reminded by normal things (like when someone talks about anything) how worthless I am. I can't help comparing myself with others - how ugly I am, how boring I am, how I haven't accomplished anything in comparison to them, etc. I don't know how to get rid of that. Working on improving myself will increase my self-esteem, but I can't help feeling bad on how I currently am. I end up ruminating on past bad experiences on how bad I am.

Advice needed,"Hello everyone,

I don't use Reddit that often but I feel like the people on this website are quite understanding and helpful. I've gotten myself into a mess during my first year of college. To provide a bit of context I've been struggling with Generalised Anxiety Disorder and Depression for the majority of my life. I took Lexapro and Zoloft for several years and after getting on those medications I slowly began feeling normal again. I wanted to stop the medication before my first year of college and so I did. During my last year of high school, I did great without the meds. I was happy and I was also excited to see what college brought about. I chose to go to the university in my hometown, a decision that I somewhat regret now. Anyways the first few weeks I was feeling great, I was participating in class, getting my work done. One morning I woke up and I felt unmotivated. This is a theme that constantly reoccurs in my life and it's one of the biggest things I hate about myself. The theme is that I always start something strong and I'm so motivated to do it. Then one day I wake up and every speck of motivation to do the task is gone. Anyways, I wake up this one morning and I feel unmotivated and tired. I proceed to email my professors that I did not feel good and since covid was going around I figured.. blah blah blah. So I do that and all my professors are super cool about it. I was planning on using this day to finish up all the work I had to do and I figured since I wasn't going to class I would be able to start working ahead. Inadvertently, I spend most of the day just laying around. I scold myself at the end of the day and try to force myself to do my schoolwork but it just isn't happening. I think ""oh well, I'll just do it tomorrow."" I ended up doing the same thing the next day and the next. Each day I woke up a sense of sadness and loneliness crept up inside me. And even though I beat myself up about it every waking second I STILL could not make myself do the work. So fast forward to the present time and it's now been over a month since I have gone to a single class in two of my courses. I skipped doing my work in all five classes for probably two weeks. Each day I wake up it takes all the strength I have just to get out of bed. I've never been one to talk or think about suicide and now suicidal thoughts are constantly in my head. I feel like a disappointment to my family and friends. I feel like such a loser. Also, I mentioned how I stayed in my hometown for college, well my academic advisor is my best friend's dad. So he basically gets to watch one of his son's best friends fail college.

I wish I didn’t have a birthday.,"I’m sure lots of us have this feeling. But i wanted to get it put of my head. I hate my birthday. The first reason is because it necessitates seeing my family. Who have spent so much time abusing me, or pretending that the abuse wasn’t there, or treating me like a diary. And acting like, when I distance myself from them, like I’m the bad guy.

Then there’s the pressure. To have fun. To not be sad, or disappointed, or stressed, so when you do feel those things it’s so much worse. And the truth is that it’ll be like every other day, and I wish I could be one of those people who can pretend otherwise.

What if nobody sends me a card? What if my partner’s present isn’t heartfelt? What if everything’s fine but I just don’t feel it?

And then there’s the fact that, even at just 25, as I get older I’m valued less and less by the people around me, and I’m surrounded by people who seem so much more together than me. More artistic, better read and more insightful.

just a huge jumble of random thoughts in no order.,"all people do is fight. fight about this fight about that fight about FUCKING EVERYTHING, people can never fucking agree on anything, they always find something even slightly bad and go “MUH THIS SIDE BAD” and it fucking hurts my brain so goddamn much, it’s politics that hurts my brain because no matter how hard you try to convince people to come together as a group they just don’t. they just fight and fight and fight.

i wish i still had that special person in my life. but of course i fucked it up big time. she never had any issues with me, i was just a pathetic mothefucker, but at the same time i don’t remember what happened between us, it was at the time i was diagnosed with schizophrenia (now i have been diagnosed with psychotic depression and a lot has changed) and i guess i just lost it. i just didn’t care anymore. i thought i had someone or something to fall back on when it was all over but i didn’t. i had just me and no one else. i don’t remember what i did afterwards. we did everything together. 

you know the NPC meme? i fell down that rabbit hole of thinking people were NPCs, i was acting all “redpilled” and “woke”, it was complete narcissism. it was an older friend who led me down that rabbit hole. they were about, 20 i think? they didn’t try to groom me or anything they just wanted to “open my eyes.” after a while i decided it was dumb. that was the end of that i guess.

2020 fucked me up,"I hate everything about this year.

I'm no longer interested in college, I'm 20years old.

My parents think my depression is just a selfish act of mines. They find excuses for it and blame it on me and also with the stupid phone excuses like a Karen.

I'm all alone
I have no close relatives nor irl friends that'll support me.

I really feel like dying this year.
And this year alone isn't the reason, I've been dealing with this bullshit for almost a decade now i can't control my depression I want to die.

It hurts more that my parents aren't supporting me they rather think I'm just selfish. I guess I'm not allowed to feel.

I’m facing a fork in the road and I don’t know what to do.,"A couple years ago my wife left me. In a city we had only lived in for 6 months. I didn’t know anyone really, except for my daughter and my ex (the reason for the move, we get a long really well, she got an opportunity that she couldn’t pass up but but she had to move, I like being a dad, I followed). 

I wasn’t sure I could make it on my  own. I fell into a very deep depression. Having my daughter near helped. 

Eventually I got a better job, I know I can make it on my own. I’ve become more comfortable with who I am and my life. I’ve learned to enjoy the solitude. I don’t really go out. I have two jobs, a very very few amount of friends. I live a quiet, dark life and I like it. 

I reconnected with an ex and started an LDR. We’re planning on getting married. We’re planning on me moving to Florida in February. 
She can’t move for other reasons I’m not getting into but they are unchangeable. 

I don’t know if I want to go. I like where I am. I hate Florida. I love her. I don’t know if I can or want to leave. 

I’m the only one that can make this decision and I’m going to fuck it up. I don’t want to hurt her. I can’t stand the thought of it. But I don’t want that change.

My first good day after being cheated on,"Last night was the first truly good evening i've had (and after a unproductive, guilt riddled day and work day where i woke up extremely late for work among other things) since finding out last month that my boyfriend of 3 months had been cheating on me daily with the same girl for our entire relationship. I did a couple things i enjoyed, did a workout, watched tv without feeling guilty, and dealt with/prepped a bunch of food in my fridge &amp; freezer (to use it up before it goes bad - i have a fucked up relationship with food) and cleaned my kitchen. I even washed my face and brushed my teeth before bed. Then this morning i woke up early, washed my face (NEVER happens in the am) and packed a good full lunch. This is just i guess to show that, even after weeks and weeks of being in a deep depressive episode that i couldn't honestly see the end of, those good days will come. Randomly, maybe. But they will come. I'm still working on dealing with being cheated on, and how that sent my body image and self confidence straight back to -100.

Making friends as easily as... losing them,"TL;DR *A feeling of catching 100 fish that escape just as quickly.*

I know my worth, and I know myself. I don't want to base my life based on shallow friendships, or just business/value-based connections.

&amp;#x200B;

And this 2nd year in university, I do make friends, close friends that accept me as I am! But... they leave. They get bored, lose interest, all for some reason I'll never really know.

&amp;#x200B;

I try and ask them, but it's always one of the below -

* *I don't know. You're someone I used to enjoy.*
* *Someone out there will like you.*
* *We just don't really connect.*
* *\[ ghosted \]*

&amp;#x200B;

Have you guys experienced this, too? Losing already-established connections, for some odd reason no one knows, or won't ever tell you? **I want to know so I can improve, yes.** ***But they... won't even tell me.***

I also appreciate the fact I can go to work and sell myself as being completely on top of things. I appreciate the fact that I can say I'm the man of my house. I appreciate the fact I can tell my friends and family everything is alright.

Dating someone with depression,"I met up with a girl and we talked about a lot of things including her depression.

I'm just going to toss this up as her being uninterested, but I'll give her some space and move on. Maybe she's afraid of hurting my feelings? But I'd rather know so I'm not wasting my time.

does anyone else get these? what causes it, how do I cope?

then it was gone. the past week left my memory, is just a blur of vague events. the desk became a piece of the background again, my phone a vague object in my hands.

Low Vitamin D levels. Foods to help?,"Long story short- I need more vitamin D than just supplements but the foods recommended by my Dr aren't an option.

Complete story-

Last year, my vitamin levels were in the ""insufficient"" range. I did nothing about this, and I dropped down to single digit ""deficient"" numbers. After taking daily 2000IU vitamin D, I rose up to the same number I was at last year. I want to get in the ""sufficient"" range because depression is hard enough as it is without accounting for low vitamin D levels.
My doctor recommended fish, milk, eggs, mushrooms, and then vitamin D fortified foods (Orange juice and bread). Issue is, I'm vegan and I despise mushrooms with all my being. Even if I weren't vegan, I don't like fish or milk in any capacity. And I don't currently eat eggs. I could if it were necessary, but I'd prefer not to. I don't eat many foods that use bread as those are generally breakfast foods and I skip breakfast since I have to be at work at the ass crack of dawn. Now, the only option I'm left with is Vitamin D fortified orange juice, which most likely won't be enough. 

Does anybody know of anything else I can do? I try to get in the sun when I can but Florida isn't very conducive to being outside in the daytime and I work 7am-7pm so I don't really see the sun on days I work.

How do I accept that I never achieved my dreams?,"I always wanted to be an airline pilot, or a private jet pilot. Since I was 14 years old, I really believed that was the career that was meant for me. I was so excited. I spent all my time studying and learning, I even bought myself a few flying lessons to see what it was like. 
I didn’t realise that not only did I have a family illness that would make it difficult for me to get a medical, but I was also below the minimum height for a pilot. I also didn’t have any money to study, but somehow I believed I could save hard and pay for it. 

I am now 24 years old almost, it’s 10 years later. I have found out that I am too short. I will struggle to get a medical certificate. And I still have no money towards learning to fly (I needed the pay rent on a house and pay for a car to get to and from work). 

So at this point in life I must come to terms with the fact that most airline pilots are qualified by 20 years old, and friends I grew up with the same age as me are now captains for airlines. I never made it. 

My heart hurts every day because I didn’t achieve my one goal in life. Nothing will ever come close to that feeling of flying myself. To become who I wanted to be, and now I feel empty because I really always believed I would make it.

"To My Therapist, the predator.","This is goodbye and thanks for nothing.

I cannot believe I've let myself be duped by you for so long. I've seen this pattern happen a hundred times, and every time I let myself get scammed because I have the hope, the dream, that this time, just for once in my life, I will finally meet a good human being, who truly cares, not some stepford-smiling ice-hearted calculator who runs on money. Parasites like you prey on people like me. That's what all this is all about in the end isn't it? Money. 

Every single repair man, therapist, dentist, doctor, every profession that performs a service for money, every last one of them has to justify their own existence. If I take my car to the shop and they fix the problem, that's it said and done. That is not a business, they did not create a return customer from me. 'Repair people' are not just incentivized, but morally obligated by their profession to break things. Sure they fix the leaky oil, but at the same time they loosen a few other bolts. A few weeks later and bam, repeat customer, your existence is justified. You get to keep living for another week, paying the price with the blood of others.

You really had me going there for a long while, but your own two-faced nature betrayed you. You were only ever in it for the money, the only time I could ever get the time of day from you is when I was paying you to give a shit. The instant money was not changing hands, the instant you were not justifying your own parasitic existence, I was no longer worth the time of day. Empty platitudes, then one-word replies, ultimately no reply at all, you were just unlucky that you pushed it too far and I realized that you'd only give me the time of day if I was paying you. Seen this pattern a hundred times, fall for it a hundred times again.

If there is such a thing as justice and such a place as hell, I hope to see you there. When I pen my suicide note I will be sure to indict you fully for your culpability in my death. You are the apex predator, the wolf who stalks the herd, waiting for the weak and sickly to grow tired, seizing the chance to pounce. No, that gives you too much credit, that implies you hunt, you put in effort. You are the wolf in sheep's clothing who sits and waits in the herd for the vulnerable to come to you of their own accord. Why lift a finger when you can simply dress in smiles and white lies and watch as the sheep line up for the slaughter? 

I hope you lose sleep at night but I know heartless psychopaths like you can read this without batting an eye. I know you feel nothing of the pain you've caused me but maybe you'll lose sleep over the thought that your prey has escaped you, and now is going to do every last thing in its power to bang the gong, let every single person know  what an insidious abuser you are, and maybe just maybe, it'll all be worth it if I'm heard for once in my life and I save the life of a single other person who would have otherwise crawled into your mousetrap willingly.",kindadepressed,22,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jgpbhr/to_my_therapist_the_predator/,goodbye thanks nothing cannot believe let duped long seen pattern happen hundred time every time let get scammed hope dream time life finally meet good human truly care stepford smiling ice hearted calculator run money parasite like prey people like end money every single repair man therapist dentist doctor every profession performs service money every last one ha justify existence take car shop fix problem said done business create return customer repair people incentivized morally obligated profession break thing sure fix leaky oil time loosen bolt week later bam repeat customer existence justified get keep living another week paying price blood others really going long two faced nature betrayed ever money time could ever get time day wa paying give shit instant money wa changing hand instant justifying parasitic existence wa longer worth time day empty platitude one word reply ultimately reply unlucky pushed far realized give time day wa paying seen pattern hundred time fall hundred time thing justice place hell hope see pen suicide note sure indict fully culpability death apex predator wolf stalk herd waiting weak sickly grow tired seizing chance pounce give much credit implies hunt put effort wolf sheep clothing sits wait herd vulnerable come accord lift finger simply dress smile white lie watch sheep line slaughter hope lose sleep night know heartless psychopath like read without batting eye know feel nothing pain caused maybe lose sleep thought prey ha escaped going every last thing power bang gong let every single person know insidious abuser maybe maybe worth heard life save life single person would otherwise crawled mousetrap willingly,therapist predator,kinda depressed,2997,30,kinda depressed goodbye thanks nothing cannot believe let duped long seen pattern happen hundred time every time let get scammed hope dream time life finally meet good human truly care stepford smiling ice hearted calculator run money parasite like prey people like end money every single repair man therapist dentist doctor every profession performs service money every last one ha justify existence take car shop fix problem said done business create return customer repair people incentivized morally obligated profession break thing sure fix leaky oil time loosen bolt week later bam repeat customer existence justified get keep living another week paying price blood others really going long two faced nature betrayed ever money time could ever get time day wa paying give shit instant money wa changing hand instant justifying parasitic existence wa longer worth time day empty platitude one word reply ultimately reply unlucky pushed far realized give time day wa paying seen pattern hundred time fall hundred time thing justice place hell hope see pen suicide note sure indict fully culpability death apex predator wolf stalk herd waiting weak sickly grow tired seizing chance pounce give much credit implies hunt put effort wolf sheep clothing sits wait herd vulnerable come accord lift finger simply dress smile white lie watch sheep line slaughter hope lose sleep night know heartless psychopath like read without batting eye know feel nothing pain caused maybe lose sleep thought prey ha escaped going every last thing power bang gong let every single person know insidious abuser maybe maybe worth heard life save life single person would otherwise crawled mousetrap willingly therapist predator

I don’t know what to do anymore,"I’ve been dealing with clinical depression for most of my life but recently it had been the worst it has ever been. I am a sophomore in college and there are so many things that have been building up and I don’t know what to do. I am in therapy but that can only help so much. 

Recently, my girl friend and I broke up and what hurts even more is that it was because of my depression and it was taking a toll on our relationship. We broke up so that we could both focus on ourselves because we can’t be in a happy relationship when we aren’t happy with ourselves. It makes sense and it wasn’t a bad break up at all, we still talk and support each other, but it has gotten to the point where I feel like talking to her has just made it harder for me to get focused on myself and I feel like I am holding her back as well. I really really don’t want to stop talking to her and I want to stay friends but I feel like my depression is building up more and more the more I talk to her. What should I do?

Also on top of that, really none of my friends besides one haven’t even asked if I was okay or even check in on me after the break up. Like i was clearly sad and torn up but none of them (except the one like i mentioned) asked if i was okay. That just made me feel like I wasn’t even noticed and that I’m all alone. 

I really don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so alone and I can’t even wake up in the morning without thinking that it’s not even worth waking up anymore. I have lost all motivation and I feel like everything wrong in my life is my fault. I don’t feel like myself anymore. I honestly don’t feel anything. I feel like a burden to everyone.

When therapie isn't available,"Where I live, almost all specialised therapy facilities have a waiting period that's at least 6 months long.

The last place I went I waited 2 years for and I just can't wait that long anymore. I currently don't have any form of therapy. I did just get some meds from my doctor that hopefully will make it a little bit better, but they won't work for at least 5 more weeks.

Does anyone have any tips or ideas to make this waiting period a little better? I already try to take a walk every day but I hate it.

struggles with basic needs,"hello. first time posting here, and i'm here to vent and ask if what i'm experiencing is common, or part of another issue entirely. i'm 18m, with one or two less than fortunate things going on that tend to get to me now and again. i've been diagnosed by my therapist and psychiatrist (severe depression and episodic depression respectively, i don't know if those are proper terms as neither quite like diagnosing).

i just really hope this doesn't get ignored. i don't blame people, however. this place has a lot of members, and a lot of people with issues similar to mine. i need to keep reminding myself of that, that i'm not alone, but it's hard to do when you're the only one experiencing exactly what's in your head. i wish i could let someone else in instead of doing the talking. i should stop rambling and get to the point. not sure if content warnings are necessary, but just in case, i'm going to be talking about the following: **eating and mentioned eating disorders.** if you're not comfortable with any of these, please don't feel obligated to read on. i just hope the words themselves don't have negative effects on anyone here. if they do, please tell me and i'll remove the post.

onto the actual issue. i've had depression for years now. i started going to a therapist back in middle school after breaking down over a 'd' in math class. since then, therapy has helped me incredibly with my anxiety (also diagnosed), but it feels like my depression is just getting worse. i think everyone's struggling at least a little with quarantine. in my case though, my high school graduation was not quite cancelled, but heavily altered to fit with all of this. the last few months of high school, i didn't see much of my friends, didn't do a single assignment, made off with Fs in all classes for the quarter but still graduated thanks to past work. summer came and went, and i was making plans to go to a local community college to take some basic classes before moving onto med school. plans were made, an appointment with the college counselor was scheduled, and i missed the appointment. i'd worked really hard up until that point, but when that happened, i stopped entirely. it simply wasn't worth it anymore. now it's october, and i've no plans to start classes in the spring semester. i keep telling myself i've got time, knowing full well that i'm not going to act on it alone. my parents are doing their best to help me, bless them both. my therapist and psychiatrist have also both recommended an iop, which i'm half-working on. i have a few numbers to call, things to set up, but again, it's not worth it. that's surely my depression speaking, but it just speaks so loud. i'm tired, and i'd rather do other things. not the things that i ought to get done, just... other things. i'm tired, and i'm bored.

the reason my psychiatrist recommended an iop was because my depression has essentially skyrocketed, but i've not told him about some other things going on, namely one thing. i'm simply not taking care of myself. this is the core of the post, really, a line that's been echoing in my head for the past twenty minutes: *even when i'm hungry, i'm not hungry.* it's not that i think of myself as fat, it's not that i think i don't deserve food (that's came and went), i'm very aware that i've been underweight all my life and i'm self-conscious about my lankiness. plus, i still eat. when my mom makes food, or my brother comes to visit and brings food, or my dad makes something, most of the time i'll eat plenty of what they made (i usually eat around one large-ish meal a day). but when i'm alone, i just don't. i don't see a point, because i don't feel hungry. well, i do feel hungry, but i don't feel like eating. i hate it when it gets all complicated, it's like i'm just spouting fluff at this point.

if i truly didn't care about eating, or about my health, i wouldn't be posting here. i'm posting here not only because i do care, but because i'm hungry. i'm hungry, but i'm still not hungry.

i don't know what i'm looking for out of posting here, i've just written an essay about my depression and decided to hit post without proofreading. i'm sorry if i've wasted anyone's time, i just want to know if this is something more serious than what i'm already dealing with. or maybe some motivation to eat. i don't want to worry my friends about this, but i keep 'slipping up.' quotes are there because half the time i'm doing it on purpose. maybe i want someone to know that i'm really, truly not all right. but none of my friends are all right either, and it's not like we can properly help each other.

i'm stopping myself from typing more. sorry for rambling, and thank you for reading this far. i'll sign this since my username is weird (and don't worry about that, genuinely).

Here’s a poem I wrote a couple of years ago about my depression titled ‘I Remember...’,"This is my first time showing it to anyone, so please don’t have super high expectations or anything, it’s pretty basic:

I remember the days where I felt like I had tons of energy,
Now I have nothing left to give.

I remember the dreams &amp; ambitions I had when I was younger,
Now there is no hope.

I remember when I had confidence &amp; belief in myself,
Now I’m too anxious to do anything.

I remember when I could experience the ups &amp; downs of life,
Now I just feel emotionally numb.

I remember when I was hard-working &amp; motivated,
Now I just feel lazy &amp; sluggish all the time.

I remember when I could live in the present,
Now I dwell on the past &amp; worry about the future.

The person I am now is not the man I was.,"I used to be someone different. Risk taker, achiever and dreamer. I graduated with good grade, was destined for greatness or so I believed. Failed businesses. Horrible job and I made the decision to quit because I didn't like it. My mistake I know it. Now I understand the pain of wasting your precious time and just watching your youth go away slowly. 
Nowadays I'm Staying awake till 5am. Sleeping until 12pm. Barely bathing and eating well. I'm just sulking on my bed, overthinking about my past mistakes and fearing my future. Crying and hitting myself at times. My only escape is that temporary dopamine hit from cumming. I just escape my reality with porn.
Recently I tried building myself again by exercising and trying for a new job. I had to go through 3 stages of an application just to get rejected at the very end. This job was the job.

Scared,"Ever since I was a baby I’ve been fucking terrified of pain, and it took until recently to figure out that people shouldn’t feel crippling amounts of pain when poked or lightly bumped. I don’t know what this could me for my long term but I don’t really plan on living much longer. This isn’t the reason for my depression but it has been one of the biggest reasons why I haven’t ended it yet. I just want to take my car and go as fast as it can, which isn’t all that fast, and slam into a wall or something. I’m just so scared that I might not die right away, and even more scared that I might live. I just want to give up, and my body to shit down peacefully in my sleep.

"I need help with a friend IMMEDIATELY ASAP, any advice would help PLEASE read","Someone I know is not doing well. Im very scared he/she is going to do something bad, and he/she refuses to get help from friends, family, anyone. Idk how to help because he/she keeps just shutting everyone off and being generally very rude to everyone, which makes all our friends besides me and a couple people not want to help. Im not sure if I can describe the situation because it is very complicated but I guess my question is how do I help someone who refuses to get help or open up? Do I do something drastic like call 911? Do I tell my parents? Our teachers? **Keep in mind we are both under 18** and his parents are not very “accepting” so to speak... Please help im very scared for him, and my friends and I do not know what to do and this is a ***VERY*** serious situation, please help me :(

edit: I would like to add more in case it helps. He feels no one cares about him, he is confused about sexuality and his parents are homophobes, he lives close to a bridge which deeply scares me. ***I*** feel like if I tell a teacher or parents, hes going to do something bad.

I’ve been wearing the same clothes for almost five days..,"I thought a few months ago that I was finally getting better and though life was starting to look up but now here I am. I’m not completely sure when I last showered, I’ve been wearing the same clothes for almost five days, my hair is super greasy, I’m starting to stink, I’ve barely been leaving the house, and I don’t want to do anything I used to enjoy. My therapist says it’s probably the lack of light because of the seasons changing and that it’ll get better but it feels like I’m never gonna get out of this rut. I’m working on being okay with my boyfriend going into the navy and it seems like I’ve made some progress but I’m probably just masking how I feel, like putting a single bandaid on a gaping wound. My grades in school suck and they’ve been rising as I work but I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up. I’m trying to make my close loved ones think that I’m at least somewhat okay, I don’t know if I want them to know how bad I really am, I don’t want to be a burden, I can’t &gt;!kill myself!&lt; because that would hurt the ones I love too badly, but how am I supposed to keep living like this, my body feels like stone all the time, and the lump in my throat and the sting in my eyes are close friend of mine now.

Alone,"Do you ever feel as if the pain you feel is not warranted? Feel like there is a shooting pain you can't pass? I read through these posts and see so many things that warrant true depression. It makes me feel like what I'm going through is so minimal.

The pandemic definitely started this feeling, I went from owning my own company and feeling like I had my life under control to feeling like I'm spiraling faster and faster downwards. I've found getting out of bed to be difficult, the want to eat is gone, I've reverted to HS days and listen to bands like brand new and just feel so isolated. 

I go for walks, Try working out but just feel so bleh. To add to the fact because of this time I met someone online that lived in Canada while I live in the US. Like any online friend that you grow a connection with it fizzled out and I just took it really hard. I don't know what the point of this post is but felt good to just write something for once. Hope others that feel like this find a way out of the hole!

Tired of being the one that cares,"I’m tired of being the friend who cares when nobody cares about me. Every time my friends have a problem, I’m there trying to help them. Any time they are depressed, I am right there. I do check ups on my friends and family because I worry about them. But hell, who worries about me? I have depression and anxiety. I rarely talk about it because I don’t want to burden others. I don’t want to burden others because when I brought up feeling down to friends and family, they would tell me they have it worse or it could be worse. 

I end up in the hospital and have to have surgery for one thing and a biopsy for another separate thing that could be benign or not. I text a friend that I thought would care and my sibling because I knew how some people just wouldn’t care, but I thought they would. I was scared and alone. 

My sibling didn’t really respond, but talked to me about the happy things going on in their life and told me “at least you aren’t pregnant like I am!’ When she knew that I’ve been trying to get pregnant for over four years, but I’m not fertile. 

My friend didn’t respond except with “that sucks” and talked about what was going on in her life. So there I was. Having nobody, crying in the hospital alone.

I don’t know what I am to people. I’m starting not to feel like a real person and it’s getting worse as time goes on. I feel like I’m a prop in the lives of others.

Feeling like it’s all my fault and I don’t even know how to title this,"I’ve been battle depression for 4 years now and I’m at the breaking point.
What’s really pushed me over the edge was something that happened a few months ago.
In the summer I made a friend online in a very special way.
In game chat they asked how everyone’s day has been and I said mine was bad and they offered to let me vent to them after the game.
This turned into a close friendship one I thought I would never have. She meant a lot to me and wanted to help me and be my friend. And then in September she ghosted next and blocked me out of nowhere. This has left me feeling betrayed and hurt like I never have before. On top of this I found out after she ghosted me I had feelings for her which only made me feel worse. I’ve let this eat at me and I feel like it’s all my fault despite what few friends and my therapist have all told me. I’ve been trying to move on but I just can’t. 
I’ve never had someone come into my life and for once make me feel loved and cared for.
And then that person who meant so much to me just as a friend left me, and I don’t even know why and it’s only made me worse.
I’m so hard on myself and after this I struggle to talk to people and be open because I’m afraid to scare people away. Not knowing why she left after everything we had been through and the promises made just makes me feel like it’s all my fault.
I’ve come here just for something positive or anything to help me.

Mental hospital to therapy to new school :/,"So while still in the mental hospital, over the phone (because in person family visits were changed to just over the phone at night because of COVID) my mom told me that I had a therapy appointment when I got out and that was the only way they would let me out is if I had an appointment soon after. I’ve switched between so many therapists the last few months and had a period of time where I just quit because I thought it was going nowhere. I had my first meeting over video chat with my new therapist the other day, same old recycled garbage over and over again, I’m so sick of it and I don’t think therapy is helping me anymore even a little bit. We also decided at the hospital that maybe what I needed was a ‘change of scenery’ to help with my depression and such, so I’m switching schools as soon as possible. So going to a new places, my areas labeled ‘worst, trash school’, with no people I know which is both great because I get a fresh start but also unnerving because I have no support system and get to keep telling myself ‘wow you have no friends loser’.

My family uses my emotions against me and I don't know how to remedy that,"My (26 f) younger brother (25 m) is a photography enthusiast and asked me to help with an idea. I was in the middle of work but took some time out because we were losing light and went to help with the poses he asked of me.  I was in quite a bit of stress from the past few days and could not retain everything he told me. So of course I didn't get all of the poses right and was making quite a few blunders. And everytime he corrected me he went on to give insulting analogies of what I was doing. He finally said: No wonder dad wanted another kid after he had you. I finally snapped and said ""Yeah, they should have just aborted me"".

He didn't say anything after that and we continued shooting, although he was a little more patient with me, but it keeps playing in my head. He says this often, that my parents had him because I'm too stupid. I usually brush it off because he has this habit of using funny punchlines whenever he hears them.

But I really wasn't in the mood today and it hit too close to my heart because things with my parents are not going great. 

I just don't know how to deal with them. Any time I react to anything, my entire family calls me sensitive. But how do I stop taking things to heart? I just don't know how to shut off my emotions/feelings and let things slide off me. Or maybe Ive just given up on trying. It feels hopeless because everyone already has their opinion and they don't want to see me in any other light.",Kittyduchess,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jgsmpj/my_family_uses_my_emotions_against_me_and_i_dont/,26 f younger brother 25 photography enthusiast asked help idea wa middle work took time losing light went help pose asked wa quite bit stress past day could retain everything told course get pose right wa making quite blunder everytime corrected went give insulting analogy wa finally said wonder dad wanted another kid finally snapped said yeah aborted say anything continued shooting although wa little patient keep playing head say often parent stupid usually brush ha habit using funny punchlines whenever hears really mood today hit close heart thing parent going great know deal time react anything entire family call sensitive stop taking thing heart know shut emotion feeling let thing slide maybe ive given trying feel hopeless everyone already ha opinion want see light,family us emotion know remedy,kitty duchess,1453,73,kitty duchess 26 f younger brother 25 photography enthusiast asked help idea wa middle work took time losing light went help pose asked wa quite bit stress past day could retain everything told course get pose right wa making quite blunder everytime corrected went give insulting analogy wa finally said wonder dad wanted another kid finally snapped said yeah aborted say anything continued shooting although wa little patient keep playing head say often parent stupid usually brush ha habit using funny punchlines whenever hears really mood today hit close heart thing parent going great know deal time react anything entire family call sensitive stop taking thing heart know shut emotion feeling let thing slide maybe ive given trying feel hopeless everyone already ha opinion want see light family us emotion know remedy
Can feel the depression coming on because of school.,"So some back info I’m m/36 been dealing with depression for about 10 years. Not taking any medication due to bad side effects I get. I’m now in school to be a heavy Equipment Operator. 

It took me a long time to find something I wanted to do. I like driving and this seamed like a good fit. 

I do ok with online learning and in vehicle I thought I was doing ok seeing as I’ve never been in a big machine before. Got my grades for the first 3 in vehicle class 

Day 1 -74%
Day 2-65%
Day 3 -60%

It’s hurting to feel like I’m slowly failing. We don’t have much in vehicle time just 8 hours a week. It’s like they expect us to come in with perfect skills already. They also don’t tell you what you need to work on to do better

And now doubts are coming in. Can I even pass the course and if I do will anyone want someone with my grades. All of this has lead up to this morning when I’ve barely left my bed.  I’ve had Netflix up but can’t even pick something to watch. 

I know if I don’t do something soon it will just get worse and I’ll be back to the start of this whole process again trying to work out a plan and feeling like a disappointment to my parents.",TheSnowSquid,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jgsk2u/can_feel_the_depression_coming_on_because_of/,back info 36 dealing depression 10 year taking medication due bad side effect get school heavy equipment operator took long time find something wanted like driving seamed like good fit ok online learning vehicle thought wa ok seeing never big machine got grade first 3 vehicle class day 1 74 day 2 65 day 3 60 hurting feel like slowly failing much vehicle time 8 hour week like expect u come perfect skill already also tell need work better doubt coming even pas course anyone want someone grade ha lead morning barely left bed netflix even pick something watch know something soon get worse back start whole process trying work plan feeling like disappointment parent,feel depression coming school,snow squid,1161,52,snow squid back info 36 dealing depression 10 year taking medication due bad side effect get school heavy equipment operator took long time find something wanted like driving seamed like good fit ok online learning vehicle thought wa ok seeing never big machine got grade first 3 vehicle class day 1 74 day 2 65 day 3 60 hurting feel like slowly failing much vehicle time 8 hour week like expect u come perfect skill already also tell need work better doubt coming even pas course anyone want someone grade ha lead morning barely left bed netflix even pick something watch know something soon get worse back start whole process trying work plan feeling like disappointment parent feel depression coming school

Just another sad person who shouldn’t be sad,"(Just another depressed kid, keep scrolling if not interested lmao) I always thought Reddit was kinda lame but then I seen the community and it actually looks kinda nice. I never once posted on here but due to recent events I figured why the hell not. My life feels almost perfect. My mom loves me unconditionally, my dad helps me when I ask but doesn’t really wanna connect with me(and I suppose that’s my fault), and my girlfriend is almost perfect so I’m often left asking why am I not happy. I understand a lot of people would want my life or say I’m spoiled and maybe I am but I haven’t felt like myself in a long time. I switched my music taste to have ‘real’ friends, I switched my interests to have ‘real’ friends and those friends are nice I guess but the actions I’ve been doing and the words and grammar I’ve been using doesn’t feel like myself. I feel as if I’m just going with the flow saying ‘yes sir or ma’am’ to whoever asks without thinking about myself. I recently bought an ounce of weed just because i wanted to hang out with some friends a little longer. But that’s another problem it’s self. 

There’s a voice in my head telling me to end it since I can’t live for myself, and honestly I don’t want to live for myself anymore since myself is the reason why I feel like this. I’ve been eying down this new knife I got and I don’t want to do it but I don’t want to struggle with myself anymore. Life doesn’t feel the same as it did when I was a kid and I’m left wondering what’s the point of everything, where do people get the desire to have hobbies and live out their life?

I don’t want replies, I don’t want positive feedback. I just want someone to listen and I just wanted to tell someone, so maybe that’s why I’m posting but regardless I don’t know how much will change.",ConstantStress4Ever,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jgsgbb/just_another_sad_person_who_shouldnt_be_sad/,another depressed kid keep scrolling interested lmao always thought reddit wa kinda lame seen community actually look kinda nice never posted due recent event figured hell life feel almost perfect mom love unconditionally dad help ask really wanna connect suppose fault girlfriend almost perfect often left asking happy understand lot people would want life say spoiled maybe felt like long time switched music taste real friend switched interest real friend friend nice guess action word grammar using feel like feel going flow saying yes sir whoever asks without thinking recently bought ounce weed wanted hang friend little longer another problem self voice head telling end since live honestly want live anymore since reason feel like eying new knife got want want struggle anymore life feel wa kid left wondering point everything people get desire hobby live life want reply want positive feedback want someone listen wanted tell someone maybe posting regardless know much change,another sad person sad,constant stress 4 ever,1797,44,constant stress 4 ever another depressed kid keep scrolling interested lmao always thought reddit wa kinda lame seen community actually look kinda nice never posted due recent event figured hell life feel almost perfect mom love unconditionally dad help ask really wanna connect suppose fault girlfriend almost perfect often left asking happy understand lot people would want life say spoiled maybe felt like long time switched music taste real friend switched interest real friend friend nice guess action word grammar using feel like feel going flow saying yes sir whoever asks without thinking recently bought ounce weed wanted hang friend little longer another problem self voice head telling end since live honestly want live anymore since reason feel like eying new knife got want want struggle anymore life feel wa kid left wondering point everything people get desire hobby live life want reply want positive feedback want someone listen wanted tell someone maybe posting regardless know much change another sad person sad

sgb.txt,"When I think about nonexistence, I feel at ease. I'm not overstimulated or dissociating regularly. I don't have to deal with the constant stream of troubling thoughts. I don't have to deal with my every train of thought violently crashing and burning into a plume of neural static.

I don't even have to think at all.

I've discussed this with loved ones, only to be met with the same response - ""But you won't feel happiness, either!"" I know. I'm perfectly aware of this.  But it's gotten to be a bit much, I tell you, having to feel all of these feelings. I like being happy when I'm able to be, but nowadays, it's only when I'm distracting myself from the world around me with assorted sweet nothings.

You see, if life is like a box of chocolates, it's gotten to the point where I've eaten too much. That sickly sweet aftertaste we all know and love has manifested. I feel like I'm going to vomit, but I can't.  As I keep eating them, the variety there once was is greatly reduced. Each chocolate is one of those crappy little dollar store chocolates that kind of taste like plastic. Every once in a while, I might come across something unique, but the aftertaste continues to linger because it's still chocolate. The worst things in the box are the occasional cigarette butts and hidden thumbtacks stabbing me in the tongue.

Now, as much as I want to throw the box away, I can't. I have people who love me, and I love them. If I throw the box away, I'll die because the chocolates keep me alive for whatever plot-related reason. If I die, I'll make a lot of people really sad and that would  suck. On the other hand, though, I won't have any intrusive thoughts to plague me if I don't exist. It's a troubling dilemma for sure.

For now, I can only hope that things get better for not only me, but for everyone else who's suffering. I guess only time will tell.

Why can’t I just be fucking normal?,"
Ever since I remember I’ve felt like I’m not good enough that I’m an outcast that I’m just no the same as other people. A month and a half ago my ex ended things between us after I freaked her out and was extremely controlling and manipulative, I literally destroyed my relationship with a self fulfilling prophecy of being a controlling freak. I couldn’t just let her be her own person, I always created issues and arguments and said so many things that were wrong, telling her I didn’t want to be with her in heated moments saying I didnt like certain things she did. Telling her how suicidal I’d felt and depressed, now I’m realising it was maybe just my way of getting sympathy, make her feel like being with me is more of a chore than anything else. I have so many fucking issues with self esteem and insecurities and depression that it just fucks everything up all the time. Any social environment with her if act out or act weird and make her friends and family question what was wrong with me, if I was moody or angry or whatever. 3 relationships where it’s clear I’ve been selfish, manipulative and controlling and pushed away the person I was scared of losing. And now I’m here, alone, dealing with this shit everyday regretting it all. Why couldn’t I just be a normal fucking boyfriend? Why the fuck am I like this? I’m so self destructive I literally do everything I can to get my own way no matter how much it hurts someone. I fucking hate myself, I just sit in fucking guilt of hurting someone I love and care about but don’t seem to care enough when it matters to stop this shit.

Anyone else complicit or apathetic with other people’s situational depression?,"I have had major depression my whole life. Honestly for me, situational depression is easy. Example, my dog dies. Sure im depressed, crying. But eventually i get over it. But my mmd is so bad, i get severely suicidal without meds. Im on meds that work but leaves me pretty much emotionally neutral. I live with it and just go through my life. I rarely have situational depression. 

But i notice that when others are situationally depressed, im apathetic about it. I see solutions to their depression and if they dont want to do something about it, then i dont want to gear it and i just turn emotionally cold. 

For example my SO is depressed about his lack of socialization. Well here’s the thing, if you’re pushing 50, have a mortgage, kids, wife, bills, uh you’re not going to have the social life of a single 20 year old with a cheap apt. Everyone else has the same life as us or, they have that but are really shitty and irresponsible people. Partying is now to the wayside. I don’t want a drunk ass, loud loser like his one friend is. His girlfriend doesn’t enjoy being the designated driver. Divorce makes you a part time parent. If you want your life from being in your twenties, then don’t be married. Our other friend got divorced and met a very controlling woman who wanted a kid and house, he did it, and is miserable. He doesn’t hang with anyone anymore  either. Go find a hobby. Go to your sports meet up group. Dont go reflecting on your fun times 20 year old self because back then? You honestly were an immature loser. Is that so great? Am i happy with too many bills, prob cant retire because of him financially. I have zero friends beyond texting because honestly, people are a disappointment. Ive heard do many negative, rude things about my depression/issues that its just easier to stay away from people.

Phased return to work,"Hi. First time poster here but could do with some advice/ reassurance. 

I work as a hospital doctor and was off with depression and anxiety for about a year. After therapy and medication, I'm feeling better and I have recently started back on a phased return. But I'm struggling with fatigue, and feeling like a failure for setting the expectation of 3 days a week (when I used to do 7 sometimes back when I was well), and only managing two on a good week.

Has anyone experienced this? I'm finding it hard to draw the line between being gentle and showing myself compassion and understanding, but also pushing myself to do what I can. 

I honestly am trying my best, but it's just frustrating, and I'm worried my mood will suffer again, as I feel a bit pathetic.

Has anyone had good experiences of returning to work? Or any advice around this subject?

Thanks in advance :)",RCT93,8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jgnduz/phased_return_to_work/,hi first time poster could advice reassurance work hospital doctor wa depression anxiety year therapy medication feeling better recently started back phased return struggling fatigue feeling like failure setting expectation 3 day week used 7 sometimes back wa well managing two good week ha anyone experienced finding hard draw line gentle showing compassion understanding also pushing honestly trying best frustrating worried mood suffer feel bit pathetic ha anyone good experience returning work advice around subject thanks advance,phased return work,rct 93,876,21,rct 93 hi first time poster could advice reassurance work hospital doctor wa depression anxiety year therapy medication feeling better recently started back phased return struggling fatigue feeling like failure setting expectation 3 day week used 7 sometimes back wa well managing two good week ha anyone experienced finding hard draw line gentle showing compassion understanding also pushing honestly trying best frustrating worried mood suffer feel bit pathetic ha anyone good experience returning work advice around subject thanks advance phased return work

Need help for a friend,"Hey Reddit,

I met this beautiful girl over a dating app. We've been talking every day for almost three months now, and we started dating. Everything is going great, I'm really into this girl. She makes me laugh a lot, she's smart, she's super cute, and she's kind. We have a lot of similarities, and we're the same ethnicity, which only made us connect more because of our similar culture. Basically, the ideal girl for me. We go on a few dates, everything is awesome. We joke about our future together. I'm not in love yet, but I could be. I'm invested in this girl. I couldn't be happier, and she feels just as happy as I am.

Or so I thought

I knew she had problems at home; her disconnection with her parents was evident. To sum it up, her father is manipulative, abusive, (not physically), etc. And I guess her mother favors her sisters over her and disregards her feelings entirely. So she doesn't feel loved by her parents or simply isn't. But she has everything; she's a teeny bit spoiled and she knows it. But as she's said, she just wants love from her parents and their validation. I guess that's a horrible way to feel for your entire life. I would probably feel the same.

&amp;#x200B;

So, fast forward to last Friday. We go on a date, everything is awesome, and I feel in love. The following day, she told me she had an appointment with her therapist. I didn't judge, that's fine. It's extra support if you need it. But for the next few days, she barely spoke to me. She just told me we needed to talk, but continued to delay it. She wasn't texting a lot and was really brief and lacking emotion. This wasn't like her at all. She was such an energetic and happy person. So I'm over here thinking, ""what the fuck, she wants to break up?? why?? and why is she delaying it?"". It was on Wednesday that we finally spoke.

She told me her therapist had diagnosed her with dysthymia, or persistent depressive disorder, and I believe she was also deemed suicidal. Her therapist also recommended her self-admit, stating that her case isn't severe enough for him to admit her. This came as a shock to me. She had told me before that she had attempted suicide, etc, and I did think it was a yellow flag, but I didn't think it was this bad. But then again, everyone always thinks that.

We've been talking since, but everything is different. I feel like I'm talking to a completely different person, not the person I once knew. Regardless, I'm offering my support, I want to be at her side. I know she doesn't have anyone else to help. She tells me how she feels, how she thinks about suicide often, how she's numb, how she doesn't want to live. I mean, fuck. That's pretty disheartening to hear, especially from someone you thought felt the complete opposite. I offer my support, and I'm really trying to help; I'll text her often, treating her normally, but I get unenergetic responses. I can almost feel what she's going through. 

Now, she's asking me to leave her. She doesn't want me to ""see her unravel"", nor does she want to bring me down with her or impact me negatively. Imagine how you would feel if someone said this shit to you. It's horrible. But I don't want to leave her; I am here for her. 

I'm afraid to leave her. I feel that if I do leave, she'll have no one else, and she just might do it. She keeps telling me she doesn't want to die yet, and that I shouldn't worry about her. But that in it of itself is pretty fucking worrisome, no? 

So what are my options? Stay with her, possibly bring me down with her (slightly inevitable, my thoughts have already revolved around her since she told me her feelings). Or, I leave her. But I don't want to leave her. I mean, what's the point of a relationship if I can't stay and help even in the hard times? I thought about contacting her sister via social media, and just establishing a connection with the sister so that if anything starts heading in the wrong direction, I have a family member I can contact, but I don't know if I would be in the wrong to do that. 

I really like this girl. I know I'd be devastated if she killed herself. 

She keeps telling me that I need to forget about her and move on.

What I'm thinking, is that I still have enough leeway to try and convince her to hang out with me one last time. I could talk to her then, try and see how she's doing. But ultimately, I think the goal will be to get her to self-admit, no? I might be able to do that if I can convince her that I'll leave her if she can self-admit. 

If I leave her, she'll have nobody else, and she probably won't have a reason to live.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do.",throwawayforfriend0,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jgrkv0/need_help_for_a_friend/,hey reddit met beautiful girl dating app talking every day almost three

"I don't know, is whining what makes me pathetic? Could I really do more? Or are people blaming and attacking me for a reason? I feel like if only certain things in my life would improve","I feel like I could conquer the world if just only my body wouldn't fuck me over so bad. I've lost several jobs due to not being able to physically handle them. I have spine issues, I understand that many people have them but I just get so stiff and my core muscles are not supporting me at all, I feel uncoordinated and off balance, while I'm trying to improve, my family and everyone thinks that I'm lazy while all I do when I get home is try to finally find a way to support my spine with endless exercises and research to stop the pain. I sleep 3-4 hours a day and do physically demanding job and all I get is ""you won't amount shit, you lazy""

People in my family are like ""I too have back pain etc"", well yeah, bitch you didn't deadlift close to 400lbs with apparently poorly functioning core.

shit I feel so misunderstood and while I whine a lot I pray that some of my work regarding improving my physical well being pays off and I can focus on things to get me above them so I can shut their mouthes. But the doubt that it might never happen is making me nauseous.

According to everyone, they think I'm the stupid one, while I'm not super smart, all my effort and being physically uncomfortable shifts my focus elsewhere so I just can't be smart about getting my job done. It frustrates, maybe my narrative is wrong though and they are right, I don't know anymore.


It honestly got so bad that I wrote a suicide letter, cried the whole night in my bed because of the thought how fucking hurt some people will be if I do this, like my little sister or mom with whom I don't have good relationships because she thinks im a loser. But I just thought ""there is no other way dude, you have tried to fucking fix your shit for a year and it doesn't get better"".

I will have no means to support myself AGAIN. I'll be a burden AGAIN. and I wake up with pain and discomfort every morning. 

My dudes I spent a month in a new workplace with fucking dirty sneakers with holes in them, and you can see that people fucking think you are disgusting. You are fucking embarrassed to go in a store with them. You don't make eye contact with anyone and just hope to get home soon.

Been depressed my whole life,"I feel I was destined to be mentally miserable no matter my circumstance in life. I’m now wishing I offed myself a few years ago when I had no friends, so I could’ve died without a trace basically. But now, the only thing keeping me here is the desire to not bring hurt upon my friends and family. They’re good people and don’t deserve that. But, life’s been sucking more and more recently, and all it has ever done is sucked. Ive suffered from depression since I was a baby, so I’ve done all the “waiting it out” or staying hopeful or being strong, and still, nothing. I’m honestly more depressed now than I was 10 years ago, so life’s only going downhill. Perhaps at one point there was something worth waiting and fighting for, but I guess I just don’t care about those hopes and dreams anymore. I’m fine if the end of my life is now. People keep saying that I need to just keep pushing on, but what if I don’t want to anymore? What if I want to call it quits? I feel if I keep pushing on it’s for everyone else and not me, because in reality all I want is to disappear. The worst thing is I hate this mentality. I don’t want to think like this, but I can’t shake this depression.

Stopped taking meds months ago and need to start again; but feeling extremely guilty about going to old doctor. Venting.,"I do not know how to summarize this without taking too long. I have been on medication for depression and anxiety since late 2017 early 2018; I felt better after a while and stopped taking them in late 2019.  

I started to feel much worse than before I started the meds after a few months and started having suicidal thoughts again. I want to start taking them again and know I need to call my doctor to get started back up on the meds; but am overwhelmed with guilt for not taking them. I know I should have never stopped doing it; I have seen a therapist for a while but had to stop due to my insurance not covering it.  

I am going to just call and do it; I have to face it, but I feel so stupid and unworthy of the help now that  I have wasted it. There is a dark voice in my head all of the time now telling me I do not deserve to go back to that doctor again; they will just tell me I am helpless and worthless.

I don’t feel like I’m depressed but everything that’s happened to me indicates so,"I guess it started from the day my now ex told me, “I think you might be depressed”

Didnt make sense to me. I had everything I thought I wanted. The girl I sought after, an internship, a group of people there for me..then I slowly became disengaged..and one by one everything I treasured and valued, even the things that were personal like music left my life. 
No sense of fulfillment. Unsure what to do. No personality. Self conscious and awkwardness all time high. 

Here I am. I have my ups and downs. But I’m making it through. I’ve juggled jobs since graduation. Majority of them I quit or found another job and switched gears. Fired once. 

I just want...that sense of fulfillment from striving towards my goals. I lost 60lb when my ex left me. I remember throughout that whole grind I didn’t feel the fulfillment so much..I was just so hurt by the pain of losing her that I just blindly kept going. Now the foundation of it..my mind and body is more willing to sit in anxiety and worry than to strive for change and achieve goals. Even now with most of the weight still gone I feel nothing. 
There are things I want to do, things I should do, but I don’t know where to turn. It’s a mix of indecision and avoidance

Just to Vent a Bit,"A few days ago someone posted a question on what depression feels like. I decided to give it a look  anyway I was unsettled at how many of the responses resonated with me. Maybe I was hoping that they wouldn't I didn't want to be able to understand what they were saying. It dawned on me yesterday that I haven't been honoring my feelings and trying to pretend Im better than I actually am. 

Most of the time I am tired, I feel a heaviness inside of me, nothing seems to bring me joy, everyday just seems to be a grind where I just have to make it through to the next one. My minds foggy, the world holds no color and everything looks the same, thankfully I have moments of anxiety that visit as well just to mix things up. Even trying to express myself here feels like its too much work, that I won't be able to get across what I mean. Why even bother, right but I still want to and I want to get better but for fucks sake its like all my energy is sucked out and all I want to do is lay down and sink underneath the earth. 

It's been this way for so long. I hate it so much. I know what I have to do to give myself a chance but it takes so much to get that momentum going.

I was doing really well!,"And then I decided to start drinking in the middle of the week and have been drunk since early Wednesday. Haven't eaten more than a handful of Dollarama pretzels in like 6 days.

I've been no contact with my father for a year and just decided to start thinking about our last talk that didn't involve me drunkenly threatening his life, where he told me I'm the product of an affair and not his.

I look like the fucking guys twin I'm so obviously his son.

So low right now that I didn't even make a throwaway, fuck it.

I just whent through a failed short term relationship,"This girl had gone through an incredibly abusive relationship in the past, she can't relate to people and basically just dates online because she knows nothing of nothing.  As an added bonus, she cuts herself with a box cutter. That girl was my world I stood by during her freaking insecure tantrums, her self doubts, I encouraged her dreams constantly. I told her to put herself first before anything and that I would always be there when she was ready. 

Well she crossed the line and began an argument with me where I kept talling her to stop that she was hurting me and did'nt care and just kept going off on me. I walked away. Sure enough the next morning I get a long letter of her apologizing, wanting a family, she admitted her anger gets the best of her. I love this girl and said to take it slow and easy.  6 hours later I get an email with her saying she's retired from dating because its too much for her. This plunged me into a nightmare of pill popping just to cope with my decision, which was she has every right to do what she wants as long as it makes her happy.

My mother passes a few days later and since I don't trust a lot of people I contacted her because I needed support. She started another argument and begged me to stop crying so hard because it was making her feel it was her fault and that she needed to cut herself. I can't believe I allowed my depression to get the best of me and since I had nowhere to go I turned to reddit. SHE FOLLOWED ME INTO THE THREAD in which the girl was anonymous and then emailed me that it was slander, a witch hunt and harassment. She said to never contact her again. Because I am not stupid I have all the conversations we have recorded were one can see she was straight up abusive of me. She went on this insane rampage of needed piece, to stop talking about her on reddit. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with that girl and I've beaten myself up everyday thinking that I simply wasn't enough for her. So here I am having flashbacks and trying to get my shit together again.

Her insults were brutal it felt like she was taking aim at all the people who hurt her in the past. I don't know what the fuck. I wrote a very scathing letter that I should not send that essentially puts her in her place and to stop deluding herself to be a saint when she was calling herself a monster days before. This girl broke my heart and then started making fun of me and my depression.

She suffers from bipolar disorder

self harms

has no friends anywhere because everyone abandons her

shes 28 has no future careers in mind except writing a book series that I had volunteerd to edit for her.

I realy loved this girl and she says that I hurt her. Guys don't let anyone make you into their punching bag.

"What do I do now? When i want to end it, but I can’t because I don’t want to hurt who’s left, but i have no more strength or will.","My life started spiraling out of control in one night. I’ve always dealt with a lot because I didn’t have the best childhood, but nothing I couldn’t push through with the help of my siblings. We got eachother through everything especially my older sister. I have 8 brothers and sisters but with them i could get through anything with a smile still wide on my face. I use to be the person that no matter how much hurt and pain i was in i still always smiled and always tried to make others feel better, because i knew how it is to fall so hard and not want to get back up, but now I can’t even muster that. It all started the night I watched my sister die. Im not gonna go into full details, but i wanted to try so hard to save her, but i had her son in my arms holding him tight and no one let me try CPR i learned and got certified in high school. It seemed like forever before the ambulance and cops got there. My childhood best friend, My step brother and his girlfriend was there. My best friend didn’t want me to try because he said he didn’t want me to live with it if I couldn’t do anything but in all honesty i now get to live with I didn’t get to try to save her all i got to do was watch her not breathing as they tried cpr. Holding her 1 year old son as tight as i can. Now i get to live with not doing anything to help her. That wasn’t my best friends decision to make. Skip a month later after dealing with the loss of my sister my whole family all broken from the lost. My girlfriend/ friend long story decides its to much and starts seeing somone else and we blocked eachother on everything. The thing is i tried ending it before my sisters death and she cried and told me she would kill herself that she didn’t want anyone else, but now she got pregnant a month after we stopped talking.. fast forward another month i wreak my car and completely go under water with my ex she was trying to be there for me (She played with my feelings too) but thats a whole other story. Theres a lot left in all these to much to cover. But anyways car totaled we made it out barely my younger sister’s boyfriend was with us, but we all got out safely. I was 19 btw when this all happened i just turned 20 in july. But now next month makes a year since she passed. I have custody of her son. I have no job and beyond broke and bills are racking up. Unemployment ran out and now i still don’t have a vehicle to even try and get me a job but idk how to want to live again or able to be happy again. Its like everything is designed in life to cause me the utter most slicing pains from every situation in my life.

"Not sure if this is allowed, but i need help in a way. Sorry for the long post, but if possible please read","I recently lost someone very close and important to me. I'm having a difficult time with it. She and i did everything together and now i have to continue without her.

Everytime I'm alone i break down and this situation has caused me a lot of emotional pain and I'm not sure how to handle it.

I mainly have been playing PC and i always had people around me, but this weekend I'm home alone and my friends aren't going to be there either. 

I have a difficult time being alone since i lost her and i don't want to be alone this weekend. I don't trust myself. 

In short all i want is someone who i can talk with in a voice call or even just text. Maybe plays some games with. I play titanfall 2,overwatch, Gta v, red dead redemption, sea of thieves, pubg and a few other too. We don't even have to play i just want to have someone to be with. 

A few things about me so you have some idea who you're talking to. 
I'm 17M and my social life has mostly been online. Thats because when i was younger i got shot and i was severely bullied for my scars and because of that i became really introverted. So when i started playing online thats when i had some sort of friends to play with. Most of the people i played with are in their 30's but now they're gone too after 5 years. 

I don't care about age or gender, i just want someone or a friend i can talk to because i feel lost and in a way scared. 

I've been having some trouble with depression and anxiety for a while now, so it's difficult for me to meet new people or even become friends with them. I'm alone in this and i can't really turn to anyone

I am blessed with an amazing family/friend circle. My depression doesn't care.,"Today I hung out with my amazing, loving, empathetic, supporting and caring family. I hugged my parents, I bonded with my 4 year old nephew, I fed my infant neice. Smiles all around. 

I barely felt happy. I tried to exercise mindfulness and being present. It didn't work. I pushed my nephew on the swings, all the while faking laughs and smiles. 

I hate. **Hate** how depression can rob me of experiencing the joy that I *know* that I should be feeling in the moment. These moments are like mathematical equations. Pushing nephew on the swing + him laughing + him calling me his favorite uncle = dopamine. Yet my calculator is returning to me with the sum of 0. 

I left feeling sad that I couldn't be happy. I cried twice on the drive back home. I'm 26 and while I've made *gigantic* strides in my mental health, I'm worried that I'll never truly overcome depression.

We talk about mental health and he see’s as nothing more than a positive thinking exercise. Just making him aware people have looked will make his day, a donation would be better, but I understand, I can’t make a donation till pay day either.

Should I just leave?,"Exams are approaching so comes along the tidal wave of unhappiness I usually go through (I'm pretty depressed but exams intensifies it).

I tell him how I feel but feel horrible for dragging the mood down. 

Today I told him : you really don't deserve to have to deal with all this

He said : it's just this exam period though right? Because if this is forever , I have my breaking point too, I can't take it forever.

Now I feel pressure.

"Not sure if this is allowed or not, but i need help in a way. Sorry for the long post, but if possible please read.","I recently lost someone who was more than just my best friend and i don't really know what to do. I hate being alone because i just break down everytime if i don't have anything keeping me busy. It's caused me a lot of emotional pain and i don't really know how to handle it well.

All i do nowadays is play PC to keep me distracted and give me something to do. I always had my friends with me, but they're both gone for the weekend and so is my family, so I'm home alone and ever since i lost my friend i hate being alone. She and i did everything we possibly could together and now i have to continue without her.

In short i just want someone or a friend i can spend the weekend with in a vc or something. We don't even have to play the same thing we can just be in a vc. I play a few games like Pubg, overwatch, gta v, sea of thieves, red dead redemption, titanfall 2 i have a few others i don't mind trying new games.

Some information to kinda give you idea of me.
Im 17M, my social life has mostly been online since i started playing online. When i was younger i got shot and severely bullied for my scars. So i started only playing online with people way older than me (they were all in their 30's) lost them too after 6 years.

I might have these problems, but it's not really noticeable in my behaviour so you don't have to worry about me being a depressing mess.

"I think people confuse ""low self-esteem"" with ""being dissatisfied with your life.""","Just about any time someone is unhappy, the diagnosis comes back ""You have low self-esteem. You need to learn that you have value. You need to learn to love yourself."" And in a lot of cases that's applicable advice. Maybe even most cases. 

But take me, for instance. I'm unhappy because I'm 47 years old and never got to make proper use of my youth. And it's not that I don't want help, I do want help. But if I go somewhere and rant about how I'm still a virgin at the age of 47, what I'll be told is ""You need help. Help with your self-esteem."" And I'll say ""I don't think I do. I think myself is pretty cool. I just don't like my life."" And people will tell me ""You're obviously being too hard on yourself for the life choices you made. If you had healthy self-esteem, you'd understand that your life choices weren't a mistake. Your life choices have value. Learn to love the sexless, friendless, mediocre you that you've become.""

I don't think that's fair, and it's definitely not productive. At what point am I allowed to say ""This is a substandard life and I should not settle for it?"" You might be tempted to say ""Whenever you want."" Which brings us back to the help I seek. No one seems to want to help me achieve the fulfillment I seek. Just a mediocre facsimile. And when I say ""I'm still dissatisfied,"" I get told ""Well you need to learn to appreciate this. You must have bad self image because you can't appreciate how good your life is now that you've followed my advice.""

Some thoughts,"First note

So i don’t truly know how to start writing this!

I am currently laying down on the bed on a Friday and it’s lockdown.

I keep thinking about my life and I can’t focus and am easily distracted by almost anything, i would be thinking about my next thing to do today and someone passes by and am all distracted by what are they thinking about me and what if behaved in this way and that way.

Honestly I can’t know for sure what is this called but lately I’ve experiencing a weird state of child like thoughts and I can’t think of one thing I’d love to do for the rest of my life, it’s like if i hear someone talking about climbing I’d think what if i choose the path to be a hiker and a climber and etc and then in the same group if there was a musician I’d start thinking about how i love music too and should try to do it and start rapping. 

Am like having this conflict of ideas and thoughts and I can’t seem to understand what I truly want or desire, i have worked 4 jobs by now Chef, steward, booking and reservations and lastly a tourism representative at the airport meet and greet.

I did love the lifestyle of being free and not being committed to one thing for the rest of my life, like traveling and meeting new people and hiking and exploring just to realize lately this weird thing about myself “ i can’t stay with same group of people for so long it makes me bored and revels i like to call it a dark side” i love having friends but it’s complicated like you always find me around and suddenly I don’t feel like hanging out anymore not because the person did something wrong but because i crave something new! I can’t seem to love myself like i used to before I judge and criticize myself all the time about things if people heard me saying they’d think am literally stupid example “ am fat or am ugly or they are looking at me this way because i said something wrong or i look a certain way.

I am somewhat sensitive on the side when i hear comments from people around me, i don’t show it i just feel it and overthink it for a couple of days maybe rarely weeks! I then try to change because of that and it’s causing me some sort of stress and like getting stuck in a vortex of change I didn’t want or that it doesn’t represent me!",Unhappy_Chocolate_58,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jglg11/some_thoughts/,first note truly know start writing currently laying bed friday lockdown keep thinking life focus easily distracted almost anything would thinking next thing today someone pass distracted thinking behaved way way honestly know sure called lately experiencing weird state child like thought think one thing love rest life like hear someone talking climbing think choose path hiker climber etc group wa musician start thinking love music try start rapping like conflict idea thought seem understand truly want desire worked 4 job chef steward booking reservation lastly tourism representative airport meet greet love lifestyle free committed one thing rest life like traveling meeting new people hiking exploring realize lately weird thing stay group people long make bored revel like call dark side love friend complicated like always find around suddenly feel like hanging anymore person something wrong crave something new seem love like used judge criticize time thing people heard saying think literally stupid example fat ugly looking way said something wrong look certain way somewhat sensitive side hear comment people around show feel overthink couple day maybe rarely week try change causing sort stress like getting stuck vortex change want represent,thought,unhappy chocolate 58,2257,13,unhappy chocolate 58 first note truly know start writing currently laying bed friday lockdown keep thinking life focus easily distracted almost anything would thinking next thing today someone pass distracted thinking behaved way way honestly know sure called lately experiencing weird state child like thought think one thing love rest life like hear someone talking climbing think choose path hiker climber etc group wa musician start thinking love music try start rapping like conflict idea thought seem understand truly want desire worked 4 job chef steward booking reservation lastly tourism representative airport meet greet love lifestyle free committed one thing rest life like traveling meeting new people hiking exploring realize lately weird thing stay group people long make bored revel like call dark side love friend complicated like always find around suddenly feel like hanging anymore person something wrong crave something new seem love like used judge criticize time thing people heard saying think literally stupid example fat ugly looking way said something wrong look certain way somewhat sensitive side hear comment people around show feel overthink couple day maybe rarely week try change causing sort stress like getting stuck vortex change want represent thought

I wish I was an animal (kind of just rambling),"TL;DR - I wish I didn't have an ego and I wish I wasn't human. I just want to be truly worry free.

The ego is my biggest enemy right now.

(Not in the sense of ""oh I'm so important, me me me! But more so just human self consciousness, being aware that I am me and that I means me)

I experienced ego death a few years ago when I experienced with LSD and it was the most spiritually connected I have ever felt, I was nothing, the term I had no meaning. There was just existence in emptiness. I had died in a way, and it was comfortable. 

Paying for it now though, PTSD from shitty environment and experience in general is now stuck with me. There are days when even the smallest ordinary human endeavour make me want to scream and isolate. I often fall into solipsism and derealization.

Bills, politics, money, hate, status, popularity, fame, war, greed. All of the things that humanity has as it's cornerstone make me seething with anger and numbness. 

Then I look at animals. Any animal, even my dogs, and I realize they never have to worry about this. They just find happiness in existence. They're free to do as they want and not worry about trivial pursuits. 

I often find that I feel closer with my ""pack"" of dogs than I do with anyone, save my boyfriend of course. He's the only human positivity in my life, he makes it worth living. I'm venting rn and probably ranting. But at 4am having to wake up at 8am, what can ya do when you can't sleep?

It feels like being sad is the only thing I enjoy anymore,It really doesn't make much sense but it's all I can say to explain how I feel.

Got fired in a very cruel way,"Hi, I am... well, dealing with a lot right now.

I worked in Marketing for a very large company for 1,5 years almost. Everything was fine (not amazing) until Corona came. Because of my mental health, the whole pandemic thing was stressing me out as well (as probably all of us) and then I had a talk with my boss - who told me, that I made too many mistakes and wasn't working as efficiently as I should have - mind you, I was sent into home office (which barely worked, because my company was very slow and inefficient on the IT-side, I had to enter my PC at work via Remote Desktop, which barely functioned and slowed down my process extremely.) Also, I was put into 'short-time work"" - so basically, I got 80% of my salary, which was paid by the state and was working 50% of my usual time -  I still had the same amount of work.

The mistakes I made were just really minor ones, ones that I usually fixed right away, that had never cost the company any money, so just the small things everyone did wrong once in a while. Other mistakes were directly linked to our poor IT-support and the problems with our dysfunctional home office system (they blamed me for not answering mails, because me mail program was not working for a whole day). All in all his criticism seemed incredibly nitpicky.

So my boss critizied me and I took his criticism by heart and changed the things he complained about. It went like this for 2 months, when he suddenly asked me to come to his office (so I travelled to my work place, because I still was in homeoffice) and he was there with a member of the board and told me, that they needed to work more efficiently in marketing, and so they needed to get rid of people - and as I am the one who has been in the company the shortest, it should be me. Of course, I was really sad, but also angry, because it was simply not justified in my opinion. 

Anyway, what really disappointed me the most, was the way they handled the whole situation. My boss didn't even have the balls to tell me this on his own, he had a board member to do it for him. Then, none of my colleagues, after they heard of this, called or wrote to me. Like they didn't care at all - I just worked with them for 1,5 years and they just pretend now, like I didn't exist. When I left the meeting, all I got from my boss, was a half-hearted ""Sorry"" - as if he had just stepped on my toe - even though he had taken away my job - which is really crappy in this economy.

When I called me boss a few days ago, because of a formality of the whole firing-process, he answered the phone and asked who it was - meaning that he already has deleted my number out of his phone.  
I often asked myself, if I was the problem, if I was a horrible person - but this simply can't be -first, because in every other job I had, I was pretty popular, but when I had tried to bond with my coworkers and to get to know them, they would just answer with one word and ignore me. So I kept to myself, and noticed that none of them were really talking to each other.

Anyway, I feel like they handle it now, as if I have never been there. I recieved a mail with my contract from my boss, and in his email signature, I could see that he had been promoted - whatever this means...

Now I am going through the troubles of applying to a new job - it is hard. There are not a lot of jobs at the moment, and I don't think my boss has realized what he had done to me, by firing me right now, or worse, he didn't care.",ocean_dwelling_ghost,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jgost6/got_fired_in_a_very_cruel_way/,hi well dealing lot right worked marketing large company 1 5 year almost everything wa fine amazing corona came mental health whole pandemic thing wa stressing well probably u talk bos told made many mistake working efficiently mind wa sent home office barely worked company wa slow inefficient side enter pc work via remote desktop barely functioned slowed process extremely also wa put short time work basically got 80 salary wa paid state wa working 50 usual time still amount work mistake made really minor one one usually fixed right away never cost company money small thing everyone wrong mistake directly linked poor support problem dysfunctional home office system blamed answering mail mail program wa working whole day criticism seemed incredibly nitpicky bos critizied took criticism heart changed thing complained went like 2 month suddenly asked come office travelled work place still wa homeoffice wa member board told needed work efficiently marketing needed get rid people one ha company shortest course wa really sad also angry wa simply justified opinion anyway really disappointed wa way handled whole situation bos even ball tell board member none colleague heard called wrote like care worked 1 5 year pretend like exist left meeting got bos wa half hearted sorry stepped toe even though taken away job really crappy economy called bos day ago formality whole firing process answered phone asked wa meaning already ha deleted number phone often asked wa problem wa horrible person simply first every job wa pretty popular tried bond coworkers get know would answer one word ignore kept noticed none really talking anyway feel like handle never recieved mail contract bos email signature could see promoted whatever mean going trouble applying new job hard lot job moment think bos ha realized done firing right worse care,got fired cruel way,ocean dwelling ghost,3480,29,ocean dwelling ghost hi well dealing lot right worked marketing large company 1 5 year almost everything wa fine amazing corona came mental health whole pandemic thing wa stressing well probably u talk bos told made many mistake working efficiently mind wa sent home office barely worked company wa slow inefficient side enter pc work via remote desktop barely functioned slowed process extremely also wa put short time work basically got 80 salary wa paid state wa working 50 usual time still amount work mistake made really minor one one usually fixed right away never cost company money small thing everyone wrong mistake directly linked poor support problem dysfunctional home office system blamed answering mail mail program wa working whole day criticism seemed incredibly nitpicky bos critizied took criticism heart changed thing complained went like 2 month suddenly asked come office travelled work place still wa homeoffice wa member board told needed work efficiently marketing needed get rid people one ha company shortest course wa really sad also angry wa simply justified opinion anyway really disappointed wa way handled whole situation bos even ball tell board member none colleague heard called wrote like care worked 1 5 year pretend like exist left meeting got bos wa half hearted sorry stepped toe even though taken away job really crappy economy called bos day ago formality whole firing process answered phone asked wa meaning already ha deleted number phone often asked wa problem wa horrible person simply first every job wa pretty popular tried bond coworkers get know would answer one word ignore kept noticed none really talking anyway feel like handle never recieved mail contract bos email signature could see promoted whatever mean going trouble applying new job hard lot job moment think bos ha realized done firing right worse care got fired cruel way
To social media or not? Your thoughts?,"Pro: prior to depression I was really into activism, it was fun and empowering. Organizing those sorts of things all happen on social media.

Con: for every successfully planned and executed activist action there were so many false starts. So much wasted time, and I’m really not down with that, it really wore on my patience. In general, im not as forgiving as i used to be about that, and i was never forgiving about it so lol.

Pro: connecting with people with the same interests. Met a lot of cool people IRL via events. Kind of wish I kept in contact with them when I fell off the face of the earth.

Con: so many fake people acting crazy on social media. Like literally people acting nuts, keyboard courage. The amount of childish arguments I’ve seen 😒 made me lose respect for a lot of people I may have otherwise liked.

Pro: artistic community. So much inspiration, people collaborating and doing amazing things. I’m a musician and it would be amazing to one day find a band.

Con: stalkers, people sizing you up, acting like they know you because they seen some pictures. Leads to drama IRL, for example potential employers, co-worker drama, ect.

Pro: speaking of bands, all the little sweepstakes and fun little things the bands do on their social media. Sigh, what I wouldn’t do to catch one of those secret shows.

Con: I could slip into an addictive relationship with it. It could affect my self-esteem. I know they’ve done studies and there’s a link between social media use and depression. I felt very depressed scrolling through social media in the past. I don’t know if I need that distraction, I’ve made a lot of progress these last two years without social media.

How long can a person “fake it ‘till you make it” until giving up?,"I have literally stripped away all non-essentials in my life and am doing the bare basics to survive. I have set the bar so low because I am so tired of not living up to my own expectations.

My goal these past couple of weeks have been to go to work, make it to therapy, and take my meds. Even that has been suffocating. 

I decided to take another small step. Last year, everything I had worked for, my dream, my job, it was stripped from me in an instant because of my chronic illness. So now, I am trying to work towards new dreams. 

Step 1: begin studying for the GRE. I don’t know when, but I have a dream of higher education and the good that I can do through that. 

But that dream is not nearly enough to get me through the days... how do we keep going?

"I can't get anything done, ever","I've been in therapy and taking medication since February but I recently stopped because reasons. I definitely think my depression has gotten a lot better in terms of my mood - for the majority of last year up until May I was having the worst depressive episode of my life, I felt worthless and I couldn't shower or brush my teeth or get any homework done or wake up for school and I was frequently late and I just felt like a shell of myself. I still have trouble brushing my teeth regularly and showering and I haven't washed my sheets in forever and my room is a mess but my mood was better and I started some hobbies and I don't really feel so worthless anymore. But now that school is in full swing again (I'm in my first semester of college) I just can't get myself to do my work. I have two missing essays for my history class and it took me hours to do a discussion post for my political science class that was due a week ago. I have a midterm and an essay due tomorrow night and another essay due Sunday and I'm not prepared for any of that. I try to wake up relatively early in the morning to get stuff done on the days I'm off from work but time goes by way too fast and I'm never able to get anything done. Back in junior year of hs I used to be able to stay up late to do assignments and study and I did so well in school but clearly I've lost that. Once senior year came around I was taking all AP classes but they were easy classes that didn't require any effort (college board is a joke btw) and I would literally lay in my bed all day after school and never did homework. It always got done during school. Second semester I dropped half my classes to be in the work program and I gave even less of a fuck about school so it's just been such a long time since I've had to put any real effort into school and it's so hard to adjust. I can't focus at all when I'm doing my assignments. It takes me unnecessarily long to finish things when I actually get around to them and most of my assignments require some reading before hand and it takes me so long to get through it and I reread things multiple times. I don't remember being such a slow reader. I used to read all the time and based my identity off my ""intelligence"" and now I feel so stupid. I'm so sluggish and I think it's depression that's done this to me. I want to get a PhD someday and I feel embarrassed talking about going to grad school in general because I feel so stupid and I can't even make it past gen ed community college classes. I'm not even full time, I'm only taking 10 credit hours this semester. I'm so lost on what to do.

Misleading Happy Moments (vent),"The shit thing about being depressed is the false glimpses of happiness. Getting a sudden burst of just true, pure happiness.

You kiss your best friend, miss your bus home and end up walking an hour in the freeing 2am autumn air. 

And that walk. That walk is pure fucking freedom. You're shivering so you jog to warm up and as you run you just feel ALIVE. As your ears go numb and your breaths run short you feel so REAL. There's emotions running through your mind, there's thoughts one after another. You think about people you love, and for once, you know that you are loved. You smell the air and feel the cold wind tickle your outstretched fingertips. You hear your heart beat hard in your chest, so strong and solid and real.

You feel reinvigorated. You feel like life is actually happening around you, even if the world is empty and silent now. After weeks and weeks of floating; of existing but not truly being there. You feel present. 

The next day you feel great. Not perfect, but so much better than before. You think maybe this is the start of an upward climb. Maybe you will start to come out of this deep depression you were in. With a gained sense of self love and knowing you matter to someone, maybe you can claw your way back up. 

But the day after that, it's all back. You wake up nauseous again, you don't want to go to get dressed or go to class. The weight of all of your problems is back on your shoulders and you feel heavy and tired. You skip school, email that you're sick, even though you know you can't afford to miss more. You're already failing miserably and this is college, you paid to be there and yet, you're skipping again.

You spend the day in bed sleeping; trying to pretend you don't exist. Your head is devoid of any creative thought or inspiration. You have no motivation to do anything. 

When you finally do get out of bed and try to socialize with your roommates, you feel distant. You chuckle and smile now and then, but it fades fast and the joy never hits your chest. It's surface level. It's all surface level. 

And you realize it's back again. The depression. It never left. It didn't fade enough. You can't claw yourself out of the pit. Even though you felt so alive two nights ago, even though you felt more alive than you had in years. You're still dead. You're still just a corpse walking around and pretending to be sentient.

I'm not doing so good this semester,"Well, that's an understatement. I'm doing horribly. Let's not even mention corona messing everything up--my grades are atrocious.

I keep forgetting to do my homework and my test scores are not great--in all my classes, not just that one.

I mean, I've always been pretty lazy, but I did well in school regardless. This semester, though, it looks like I'm gonna go from a 4.0 to about a 2.5 if things keep going the way they are. There's only a month left of classes, so it's basically guaranteed.

"I'm new here, and I just need don't want to feel alone with this. ( M 24 )","I'm new here cuz I'm running out of options. I've been dealing with depression (mostly seasonal) since I was 14. I've been in and out of hospitals and programs, on and off medication. For the past 2 years I just smoked weed every night to try and just make it to the next day. I was in a horrible marriage that was driven to end. I stopped smoking weed and hoped my life would perk up a bit. It's now October and I live in Ohio. Things are getting bad for me again. I don't want to worry my friends and family with this sh*t again. I hold onto a lot of rage and hatred for myself and the way I am. I get so angry at myself and not being able to control my thought that I burn myself with a lighter to try and bring myself back to reality long enough to focus. It gets worse by the day. I don't want to die, I just want to be able to think straight and not feel this pain. I don't want constantly hate myself. I end up hating the world around me because of it. I see happy people on social media or people just around me. It makes me hate myself even more that I can't just be happy. I sometimes feel I'm not meant to be in this life because I'm sensitive and don't know how to handle my emotions. My failed marriage has left me unmotivated, with no goals or ambition. My creativity is gone. It takes most of my energy to just focus on my job and make sure I have enough money to pay my bills. I don't wanna feel this away, idk how to stop it, and I feel like i'm the only one. Someone tell me I'm not alone in feeling this. I just want to get by without feeling so much hatred anger.

How to contact a counselor about depression/suicidal thoughts,"I’ve been struggling with undiagnosed depression for about four years now.  I don’t really have the energy to prove it, so just trust me.  I was shown a resource at school for contacting a counselor for free, and I was wondering: has anyone had a good experience with a school counselor/therapist?  If so, how do i contact them for the first time?  I’m terrified they’ll see me as faking, or even worse, they won’t be able to help.  At this point, this is kind of my last resort.

Loving someone who I can never have,"I’ve always struggle with depression, but these last couple of months I really thought things were getting better. 
I moved into a new place in the city, I found myself more and more running into someone who I’ve always thought was attractive and got along really well with, but it was growing to be more since after the move. I really crawled out of my shell one day, I told them straight up “I find you very attractive.” Because of the circumstances we could only exchange a few words; he thanked me said I was beautiful, I left. Next day I never planned to see them, I was too nervous but they managed to find me. Cue the romantic scene, passes by waving to me on their motorbike. I didn’t recognize who it was so I thought nothing of it. He then goes around comes back and parks, honks at me and signals me to cross the street to talk to him, only to tell me he has a wife and kids. Cool man. I’m happy for you. I didn’t think it would ever work out anyways but fuck me I feel pretty damn useless now. It’s funny how something I thought wouldn’t bother me much would destroy me in the end.

I just really needed to get this out somewhere cause I have a non-existent support circle.

My mind blanks constantly and the constant tension prevents me from focusing on anything, I take so long to finish homework even if I spend all day doing it. I'm way less eloquent now. I feel dumb.

I think I lost my chance to be happy,"Before the pandemic, I was finally getting my shit together. I was getting into the best shape of my life, I finally moved out into my own place, I was eating healthy, I had a positive outlook on life and I was optimistic about my job. I was even debating getting back into the dating scene. Once the pandemic hit, I tried to keep it together but everything is just bad now. 

I lost nearly all my progress in weightlifting and the resistance bands I've been trying to use haven't been nearly enough, let alone the small space in my apartment. Meat prices went up and my job has been playing hot potato with both my salary and job responsibilities, making my anxiety almost constant. After not drinking soda for about ten years, I'm back to drinking it, ordering pizza and have to struggle just to cook anything rather than order from Grubhub or go to McDonald's. 


I used to take pictures of my gym progress nearly everyday and, now, I haven't taken a picture of myself for at least five months. I feel ugly, disappointed and alone. The only sense of happiness I've found in all this stress is my cat, who has constantly been next to me no matter where I am in my apartment. She's the reason I try not to entertain anything drastic, because I've woken up wanting to give up.


I feel like nothing will go back to normal and I changed my life too late. I feel like I'm back where I was years ago and I'm too depressed, anxious and angry to give it another try. I busted my ass for years just to have it all taken away from me. I'm eating a burrito from a local Mexican joint while I type this and, even though it's good, I don't feel good. With Winter around the corner, it'll only get worse.



I feel guilty with every cinnamon roll or potato chip that I eat and that makes eating them so much worse and I just want to eat more and forget about it. I want to run far away enough from the successful, great person I used to be before all this so I don't have to face them. I just want to eat and stay away from everyone.



No conventions, no concerts, no meetups with friends and potentially no holidays. I'm so close to just throwing away my resistance bands and just holing myself away in my apartment, since I work from home now, and just order takeout. I can't find any reason to care anymore and I hate myself for it. I had a chance to be happy, about a year and a half's worth.

I miss the old me, the girl who could laugh something off, the girl who couldn't give a shit about what others think, the girl who would just take things as they come.

Everyone else around me is moving forward and I'm standing here just watching. I want to be happy again, but I don't know how anymore.  


It's hard trying to figure things out when you worry about your mother and brother's well being, despite that my mom has told me time and time again I need to create a life for myself, but why do I feel so guilty and think I will abandon both of them when that time comes? I seriously hate myself so much right now, I don't know what to do anymore, I know I need to be the one to pick myself up, but how do I do that when everyday I wake up feeling so fucking defeated?

They say pain is only temporary then when will it end?,"I been told by so many people and read it so many books -
""This pain is only temporary... Keep going""

Well I been going for 14 years hoping it'd end. And now it stopped but then again I stopped feeling anything and everything. For last one year I just want to end it all cos I feel that's the only way I'll feel some kind of peace in my life. (You can read extent of my illness in my previous posts).

I don't wanna ""keep going"" no more. I'm tired and exhausted and just want to feel at ease once and not be plagued by my emotions.

Any strategies on improving social skills and cognitive function while struggling with depression.,"Bit of a read, fair warning.

I'm a 29 y/o who through the circumstances of unchecked depression/social anxiety and an emotionally abusive/neglectful childhood feel very lost in life. School life was very tough for me both academically and socially and I didn't develop good skills in either part of my life. Needless to say this problem has only compounded with time to the point I find it very hard to relate to people, carry conversations, make new friends, and maintain relationships. I want to work on my social skills, and keep educating myself in general. I want to grow and move forward as a person; to grow and nurture new friendships and connections. However, my depression leaves me with barely enough emotional and mental energy to remain functional day to day. I often don't even have enough energy to propel a conversation, or pay enough attention to meaningfully contribute to a conversation. Additionally my mind feels so slowed down at times that I cant keep up, and I feel so uneducated on most topics to form my own views and ideas. 

This is something I want to change desperately. I feel like developing better social skills and being able to better maintain connections would work towards taking out a large cog in the machine of my depression overall. How many of you out there have dealt with these specific areas of your depression? Have any of you developed good strategies for combating that heavy ""brain fog?"" Alternatively, are there any of you who have found good resources to develop your social skill and better maintain relationships? I hope to share ideas with this community in working towards a little more energy and a little clearer mind.

Now I can’t stop thinking about them and I’m getting mini anxiety attacks and my insecurities are starting to mix with them. To make matters worse, one of my biggest stressors is my finances, and I’m gonna have to pay $30 a week that I can’t really afford. And that’s causing more stress.

Executive Dysfunction (?),"Hello! I decided to post here because while I'm not sure if I have depression (not diagnosed), I think I may have a few of the symptoms and have no idea what the fuck to do. Starting off with my main concern, I honestly think I have executive dysfunction. I hate self diagnosing so I am not saying for sure until some who actually knows about the topic tells me, hence my post here.

I am currently a Junior in high school and I am only taking 5 classes. I'm taking 3 APs in which i have 3 Fs in them and I have a C and A in the other two regular classes. I'm so fucking devastated. Every single day, and what feels like every single minute of the day, I tell myself to just get up and do the assignments, or to get up and go to class but it just stays as a thought? Like I'll tell myself to get up and brush my teeth but my body just doesn't follow what I say? I don't know if this is making sense but I feel like this is my biggest struggle right now. I may end up not even graduating high school after getting As and Bs my freshman and sophomore year and I'm just so done with life right now. Like I have procrastinated before and this is such a different feeling, so I can't help but think there is something else going on in my brain..

Okay a simple question ending up with me ranting, sorry for that. In conclusion I guess, what should I do? If I am not depressed already, I feel like this downward spiral with just get worse and lead TO depression anyways.

My depression is slowly consuming me.,"I’m new to Reddit, and decided to join this group tonight after I got off work because I just don’t know who to talk to. I only see my psychiatrist every two months and I don’t see him until the 11th of November. I don’t talk to my family about it because I don’t want them to see weakness and I want them to know that my life is on track. My co-workers just don’t care and I don’t blame them. I’m a 27 year old male. I was diagnosed initially with schizophrenia at HCPC back in 2016, but after another two month stay at the same hospital I didn’t meet the criteria for it anymore and was diagnosed by a team of psychiatrists and psychologists with major depressive disorder with psychotic symptoms/features in 2018. I was put on invega, cilexa, and gabapentin. About a month an a half ago I decided I wanted to get off of meds and tried to wean myself off, and started binge drinking to cope with the withdraw symptoms. I developed psychosis from all that stuff and don’t remember almost a week before leading up to the hospital. I stay with my Dad right now to save money. I told him I wanted to shoot myself in the heart with my powerful crossbow so he called 911 and two paramedics took me to Cypress hospital where I was in suicide watch. It was the worst 5 days of my life. I don’t really want to talk about that stay.

Anyways, when I got out I suffered extreme insomnia. I was told by my doctor there that it wasn’t from the alcohol because it already left my system. I stayed up for 24 hours every other day. My appetite was insane and I ate everything in sight. I think this was because I stopped eating when I stopped my meds and my body was craving nutrients. Anyways I started feeling better up to about 2 weeks ago. My Doc put me on trazadone and my sleep got better. Now i’m up until 5 am and sleep until 2 as I don’t work until 5. My appetite is back to one meal a day. 

I just feel stuck. And lonely. I have a supportive family but I feel distant from them. All I do is work, sleep, eat, and play on my phone. My days off are ruined because I wake up so late. My dog Oliver is there to great me in the afternoon when I wake up and he kind of helps me. I just feel like i’m a burden to everyone and people are talking about me. I feel like i’m just a robot or a machine pushing through everyday life. I know thousands of you feel the same way but i’m scared that this time it will get much worse. I’m sober now, and after almost dying the first night at the hospital i’ve been scared straight from using drinking to cope. I was treated horribly in the hospital by some of the staff. I don’t think they were equipped to deal with people like us who suffer things like this. I don’t know, just needed to vent.

This is silly but one of the only things keeping me alive right now is my pet bunnies,"This sounds so silly but I've been suicidal for years and I recently started a new medication that's kind of taken the edge off my severe anxiety and depression, but I still would've ended it if it hadn't been for a few factors. One of them is my pet bunnies. It's definitely not the only reason but it's one of them. I feel like I have a purpose. To take care of them, look after them. And I know they're animals and I don't know if animals can experience love, but I tell myself they love me and I love them. I can't work. I can't go to school. For the longest time, my only goal was to commit suicide. I plan for hours and months and years. I feel like I have a purpose now. I like snuggling with them and petting them and caring for them, and watching them, and even cleaning the house after they make a mess. 

I even plan to let them have one litter of babies someday, although I keep them in separate rooms now because the female is too young. It will probably be months before I can let them interact and let them have babies. I was planning on ending it this month, when I turned 21. Now, I have something I have to wait for. I have to wait a few months. And when it finally happens, I have to take extra care of them. I feel like I have something that brings me even a little bit of happiness, even if I still do feel suicidal all the time. It feels nice to take care of something because you want to take care of it.",floralandfading99,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jghk6n/this_is_silly_but_one_of_the_only_things_keeping/,sound silly suicidal year recently started new medication kind taken edge severe anxiety depression still would ended factor one pet bunny definitely reason one feel like purpose take care look know animal know animal experience love tell love love work go school longest time goal wa commit suicide plan hour month year feel like purpose like snuggling petting caring watching even cleaning house make mess even plan let one litter baby someday although keep separate room female young probably month let interact let baby wa planning ending month turned 21 something wait wait month finally happens take extra care feel like something brings even little bit happiness even still feel suicidal time feel nice take care something want take care,silly one thing keeping alive right pet bunny,floral fading 99,1427,85,floral fading 99 sound silly suicidal year recently started new medication kind taken edge severe anxiety depression still would ended factor one pet bunny definitely reason one feel like purpose take care look know animal know animal experience love tell love love work go school longest time goal wa commit suicide plan hour month year feel like purpose like snuggling petting caring watching even cleaning house make mess even plan let one litter baby someday although keep separate room female young probably month let interact let baby wa planning ending month turned 21 something wait wait month finally happens take extra care feel like something brings even little bit happiness even still feel suicidal time feel nice take care something want take care silly one thing keeping alive right pet bunny

ECT referrals in Ontario,"I've suffered from severe depression since 2012. I had previously been able to work (scanning heart rhythms in a private cardiology clinic) but my depression has become so severe I can't cope with day to day work and have had several hospital admissions for suicidal thoughts.

I have been on 7 different antidepressants (all starting low dose the going up through doses to maximum)- No alleviation of symptoms at all. I've completed a 6 week course on CBT, DBT and Mindfulness- No help at all.

I my last few consults with my psychiatrist I have pushed for an ECT referral as I meet all criteria, only to be fobbed off.  


At this point ECT is something I really want to pursue. I know there's no guarantee and it's not a miracle cure but I'd like to try something. How to I get them to listen? I've even taken a checklist of criteria all ticked off to show them but still no movement. So frustrating getting nowhere with meds when a potentiallaly ideal treatment exists.

Strange Urge to Die,"I don't know if I should be posting something like this here, but I just wanted to share what I think was quite strange.

To give a bit of backstory: I am not depressed nor sad. I have a cheery and sanguine personality. I have hobbies which I am pretty enthusiastic about. I am in University, majoring in math, and am doing well. I have no financial problems whatsoever because I earned quite a bit of scholarship. My family is normal. Upper middle class, caring and loving and christmases and birthday parties and all that; I have no childhood traumas or anything either. I don't have any worries currently and I have a lot to look forward to in my life. My dream is to someday research a topic in math, and I don't think that dream is unachievable. I work hard to study every day not because of feelings of obligation, but because it interests me. I don't work too hard that I'd tire myself out either.

However, despite being so abjectly normal, I am constantly wanting to die. There is no sadness or anything pertaining to my urge; it's like constantly being hungry and thinking ""I want to eat a sandwich."" I am not ""tired of it all"" as some people put it. 

Maybe some people will say that I don't really want to die, and that I am being overdramatic or facetious. That may be so, but I have tried jumping off high cliffs and tried stabbing my neck with a knife several times. At the last moment, I kinda get stiff and almost pass out, unable to actually kill myself. I don't want to cut my wrist and leave scars when I fail killing myself. I want a surefire way to die (I have not tried to hang myself because we dont have a beam high enough at my house).

If somebody told me that I have things to look forward to and a reason to live, I'd agree with them. But I feel like that is in no way correlated to me living or dying. To make an analogy, when I was little, I didn't want to go to sleep when my cousins came over to play because I was having so much fun. Now, however, I don't mind going to sleep when they come over. Not necessarily because I am tired or it isn't fun playing with them, but for some reason I dont mind going to sleep. I will also have fun the next day, and going to sleep doesn't really change that. That's exactly how I feel about dying. Except I have an urge to die, unlike going to sleep.

The fact that I want to die doesn't make me sad or anything; the notion of wanting to die as if I were some kind of mentally weak depressed person kind of amuses me sometimes. The only thing that stops me from killing myself is the fear of the process of dying. Reasons like ""your family will be sad if you die"" doesn't deter me from wanting to die because I think it really doesn't matter what your family feels - or anybody, for that matter - feels or thinks after I am dead.

Yeah I thought it was quite weird. My writing may be all over the place because Its time for me to sleep and I didn't have time to organize what I wanted to convey. But basically I don't think dying is a big deal; no more serious than eating a sandwitch. That might be why I'm constantly wanting to die.

I've always been the 'quiet' and lonely type. I've always been friendless and unable to create new connections. It's a repeated cycle of acceptance, sadness, anger and a will to change something. No matter how often I try to change anything, I fail, and end up at the beginning of the cycle.

"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

*******

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is allowed here. Not today or any day.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide *is*, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times.  

Please understand that we're all for well-informed, strategically-savvy activism.  It's essential in the fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and the fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding.  Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL.  

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population.  We used to allow it, until the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming, and, not without regret, we made this rule.

"The more I think about it, the more suicide seems like the only viable option","I don't even know where to start. My whole story is just long and stupid. 

I'm turning 36 soon. All I ever wanted was to be a mother and have a husband who actually loved and respected me. I don't think that will happen now.

I got divorced a couple years ago from a much older husband who lied about wanting children and wasted 7 years of my life pretending that ""next year"" we'll have kids, despite it being a sexless marriage for the last 5 of those years. I put up with it because i was financially dependent on him and I moved to his country when we married and had no easy way to pick up the pieces and return home.

I did meet the person that I thought was my soulmate a couple years ago, though. Yet again, in another country. I had to return to where I was living and due to visa issues and then border closures, we have not seen each other since. We planned to get married, but now when I talk about making my way back to his country, he acts like he doesn't really want me to come. I don't think our relationship will last and he's everything to me. Everything that I do that I care about is tied up with him. All my hopes and dreams for the future are tied up with him.

On my own, I have nothing. I have no way to support myself. No real job experience , qualifications, or professional contacts. I spent my adult life basically being a housewife, hoping to have babies and stay home and take care of them. 

I have no close friends. My family is useless. They know what I've been going through and don't even ask if there is anything they can do to help. They made it clear that I couldn't stay with them.

I'm trying to make my way back to the US because the lockdowns in my current country are so bad and making my mental health worse. They've taken away everything I enjoyed doing. I don't even leave my flat anymore. I might have to leave my cat behind because I'm having so much trouble finding a pet transport company that can take him and it's so expensive. I'm rapidly running out of savings and I have to go soon or I won't be able to afford to move at all. It breaks my heart to think about rehoming him. He's been my only friend for years.

I have nowhere to go. No job. No one I can ask for help. No babies. Probably not even my fiance for much longer. I have literally nothing to look forward to in life anymore and I'm just done.",AustrAion,8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhpbj1/the_more_i_think_about_it_the_more_suicide_seems/,even know start whole story long stupid turning 36 soon ever wanted wa mother husband actually loved respected think happen got divorced couple year ago much older husband lied wanting child wasted 7 year life pretending next year kid despite sexless marriage last 5 year put wa financially dependent moved country married easy way pick piece return home meet person thought wa soulmate couple year ago though yet another country return wa living due visa issue border closure seen since planned get married talk making way back country act like really want come think relationship last everything everything care tied hope dream future tied nothing way support real job experience qualification professional contact spent adult life basically housewife hoping baby stay home take care close friend family useless know going even ask anything help made clear stay trying make way back u lockdown current country bad making mental health worse taken away everything enjoyed even leave flat anymore might leave cat behind much trouble finding pet transport company take expensive rapidly running saving go soon able afford move break heart think rehoming friend year nowhere go job one ask help baby probably even fiance much longer literally nothing look forward life anymore done,think suicide seems like viable option,aust raion,2358,77,aust raion even know start whole story long stupid turning 36 soon ever wanted wa mother husband actually loved respected think happen got divorced couple year ago much older husband lied wanting child wasted 7 year life pretending next year kid despite sexless marriage last 5 year put wa financially dependent moved country married easy way pick piece return home meet person thought wa soulmate couple year ago though yet another country return wa living due visa issue border closure seen since planned get married talk making way back country act like really want come think relationship last everything everything care tied hope dream future tied nothing way support real job experience qualification professional contact spent adult life basically housewife hoping baby stay home take care close friend family useless know going even ask anything help made clear stay trying make way back u lockdown current country bad making mental health worse taken away everything enjoyed even leave flat anymore might leave cat behind much trouble finding pet transport company take expensive rapidly running saving go soon able afford move break heart think rehoming friend year nowhere go job one ask help baby probably even fiance much longer literally nothing look forward life anymore done think suicide seems like viable option
My friend committed suicide this week.,"She was just my internet friend, but as a socially impaired person, internet friends are my everything. We'd been friends for almost 5 years, we shared everything with each other including our personal information. A few days ago I received a message from her, it was her suicide note. Surprisingly, I felt nothing but calm, I knew she'd do it. She had been struggling with depression and her abusive family was pushing her over the edge. 

&amp;#x200B;

I said goodbye to her, then did nothing about it. I knew her address and phone numbers, but instead of calling the police or her family, I chose to do nothing. That was in her suicide note, ""do not call the police"". And as a suicidal person myself, I understood the reason.

&amp;#x200B;

She passed away. It's been 4 days. I eat and sleep as usual, like nothing ever happened. I've told no one about it and her family doesn't even know about my existence. But I know there's something deep inside me, waiting to burst out, and I don't know if I can take it when it comes. I should have called the police, right? She might still be alive if I had called someone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I miss her so much.",sheila204,9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhpazr/my_friend_committed_suicide_this_week/,wa internet friend socially impaired person internet friend everything friend almost 5 year shared everything including personal information day ago received message wa suicide note surprisingly felt nothing calm knew struggling depression abusive family wa pushing edge amp x200b said goodbye nothing knew address phone number instead calling police family chose nothing wa suicide note call police suicidal person understood reason amp x200b passed away 4 day eat sleep usual like nothing ever happened told one family even know existence know something deep inside waiting burst know take come called police right might still alive called someone amp x200b miss much,friend committed suicide week,sheila 204,1153,38,sheila 204 wa internet friend socially impaired person internet friend everything friend almost 5 year shared everything including personal information day ago received message wa suicide note surprisingly felt nothing calm knew struggling depression abusive family wa pushing edge amp x200b said goodbye nothing knew address phone number instead calling police family chose nothing wa suicide note call police suicidal person understood reason amp x200b passed away 4 day eat sleep usual like nothing ever happened told one family even know existence know something deep inside waiting burst know take come called police right might still alive called someone amp x200b miss much friend committed suicide week

"I beat mental illness today, for the first time in ten months. There is hope!","For the first time since I did MDMA on the 3rd of January, I’ve got back that sense of rigidity, stability and purpose; my identity has returned. When I look in the mirror, I don’t see a victim and recoil in disgust, I see a survivor and a warrior who has been through hell and back and has lived to tell the tale. I’m not stuck in a dissociative haze where i forget everything I have done the day after it happens. I feel free to express myself, and I don’t live in constant fear of social judgement. I’m not constantly on the edge, trying to deal with the constant extreme mood swings that plagued me in the months prior to today. Hell, even a few days ago I was convinced that it would never end and I would’ve destined for suicide.

This subreddit has some members in it who are in very dark places. Although it doesn’t seem like it, THERE IS HOPE! You WILL get better, you WILL see the light at the end of the tunnel and you WILL be able to see a future where you are happy and stable. I can’t tell you when that whether that happens tomorrow, in a month or in a few years, but I can promise it will happen.

Now that I’m optimistic again, I need to adjust my lifestyle to continue to feel this way. I plan to do this through exercise, hydration, socialisation and diet.

I hope this gives a sense of hope to those who are struggling, and helps someone out there who is having difficulty finding a reason to continue with the pain. It will get better, I love you all.",SanicThe,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhs8jj/i_beat_mental_illness_today_for_the_first_time_in/,first time since mdma 3rd january got back sense rigidity stability purpose identity ha returned look mirror see victim recoil disgust see survivor warrior ha hell back ha lived tell tale stuck dissociative haze forget everything done day happens feel free express live constant fear social judgement constantly edge trying deal constant extreme mood swing plagued month prior today hell even day ago wa convinced would never end would destined suicide subreddit ha member dark place although seem like hope get better see light end tunnel able see future happy stable tell whether happens tomorrow month year promise happen optimistic need adjust lifestyle continue feel way plan exercise hydration socialisation diet hope give sense hope struggling help someone difficulty finding reason continue pain get better love,beat mental illness today first time ten month hope,anic,1472,77,anic first time since mdma 3rd january got back sense rigidity stability purpose identity ha returned look mirror see victim recoil disgust see survivor warrior ha hell back ha lived tell tale stuck dissociative haze forget everything done day happens feel free express live constant fear social judgement constantly edge trying deal constant extreme mood swing plagued month prior today hell even day ago wa convinced would never end would destined suicide subreddit ha member dark place although seem like hope get better see light end tunnel able see future happy stable tell whether happens tomorrow month year promise happen optimistic need adjust lifestyle continue feel way plan exercise hydration socialisation diet hope give sense hope struggling help someone difficulty finding reason continue pain get better love beat mental illness today first time ten month hope
Fuck popular kids.,"All they ever do is make a person severely depressed, if already depressed then suicidal. They can pick on losers like me, and yet they will still be treated well by teachers. I was in this school which I was kicked out of in March (that day still haunts me), the students there are bloody mongrels. The school was hard to get into: you had to pay 31 thousand dollars for every year and also pass a test to get into this school. I made it into this school to be brawled by students for my ""stupidity"" and poor social skills. I never got my vengeance; and to this day, I still wish to punch one of these motherfuckers SO HARD, they will pass out into coma.

The reason these people never got into trouble was because ""they recieved good grades"" or ""they were good boys"", OR EVEN IF THEY WERE ATTRACTIVE. For example, we had a teacher who lead finance, and we had a popular drug junkie girl (she even looked visibly high) come into class, all wearing clothes that went against school guidelines, and he didn't fucking blink an eye. What I am even more confused about was the fact that SHE wasn't even part of our class at all. And yet she could sit around for thirty minutes doing nothing.

Fuck those pricks, and may the school shut the fuck down. They don't care about anyone's social status, yet they claim to ""provide students with safety and comfort"". And people keep calling this school ""the Best of all best"", when you have reluctant pigsty like this.

Fuck you if you know the person is severely depressed, but you keep bullying him for clout.

Is it romanticizing death if i really do want to die?,"I struggle with suicidal thoughts, so I guess I've just had too many fantasies about all the ways I could die. And I guess I'm too trapped in my own little thought process, because I mentioned how nice it would be for me to die when I was talking to my friend. She then accused me of romanticizing death and I don't know.. I feel a bit guilty about doing so but I also can't help wanting to defend myself. It's a coping mechanism for me, if anything else (probably because I'm too much a coward to actually go through suicide)... 
I've told said friend that I used to struggle with suicidal thoughts before but I was lying (I still struggle with them) since I didn't want to make her worry more.

I thought it was a joke, when i realized i didn't screamed i was shocked. I casually walk to my mom's room and tell her my brother killed himself in his room. She called the ambulance but it was to late. There's a note it's pretty long and my mother threw it in the trash but i was able to read it. It basically says that he can't fit in anywhere even in his own family, that he doesn't know if he have a purpose in live, and that he was a burden to me and our mom who's a single mother. Today my mom doesn't mention him at all because she doesn't have any time to think about it. The reason why I'm writing this is because i feel that same way that he felt and i think I'm going to commit suicide. Maybe tomorrow or maybe even next year but i think i will do it no matter what happens.


I don't even know the real reason why I'm posting this. I'm writing to a bunch of stranger that i will never meet and will forget about this post in a couple of hours.

Got a wave of intense suicidal thoughts and decided to bake some cinnamon rolls :),"They are currently in the oven. They are very time consuming so they work as a great escape.

I made them with whole wheat flour and oat flour and just 1 tablespoon sweetener. Also with dates and cinnamon as filling. So they are healthy. 

Im very hungry and im waiting for them. Gonna boil a egg too because eggs are nutritious. 

Tho, even baking kinds feel fake a bit.

It feels like a dirty escape, I'm just not doing anything to resolve the issue of suicidal thoughts. I'm instead running away and distracting myself.

While baking this I kinda had sucidal thoughts in back of mind. They weren't as intense when I'm sitting in bed and doing nothing but they still existed. Kinds just waiting for me to finish my escape to get back to me...

It was fun making the dough but I still felt a bit empty. Nothing can stop loneliness. I imagined myself if I had someone I could feed this to other than my family, my family really don't know my true self. No one does. 

I wish there was someone who knew my true self and I could share life with. But for now it's me and my desserts , and my family eating them....

I just wish if someone hugged me and we would eat this cinnamon buns while maybe watching a movie together. Thinking about this makes me want to cry.  I literally have 0 friends. No one texts me or anything. 

Since 8rh grade began literally no one ever hanged out with me or anything. I'm always alone. There were 2 girls that usally talked to me but I've noticed them trying stay away from me more and more. I don't want to think about it right now.

I really don't know why I'm alive. I kinds ruined my mood by sitting down and writing this post....  I was distracted but now since I written down things about suicide I might think more about it....",throwaway023829,20,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhfr45/got_a_wave_of_intense_suicidal_thoughts_and/,currently oven time consuming work great escape made whole wheat flour oat flour 1 tablespoon sweetener also date cinnamon filling healthy im hungry im waiting gonna boil egg egg nutritious tho even baking kind feel fake bit feel like dirty escape anything resolve issue suicidal thought instead running away distracting baking kinda sucidal thought back mind intense sitting bed nothing still existed kind waiting finish escape get back wa fun making dough still felt bit empty nothing stop loneliness imagined someone could feed family family really know true self one doe wish wa someone knew true self could share life dessert family eating wish someone hugged would eat cinnamon bun maybe watching movie together thinking make want cry literally 0 friend one text anything since 8rh grade began literally one ever hanged anything always alone 2 girl usally talked noticed trying stay away want think right really know alive kind ruined mood sitting writing post wa distracted since written thing suicide might think,got wave intense suicidal thought decided bake cinnamon roll,throwaway 023829,1765,82,throwaway 023829 currently oven time consuming work great escape made whole wheat flour oat flour 1 tablespoon sweetener also date cinnamon filling healthy im hungry im waiting gonna boil egg egg nutritious tho even baking kind feel fake bit feel like dirty escape anything resolve issue suicidal thought instead running away distracting baking kinda sucidal thought back mind intense sitting bed nothing still existed kind waiting finish escape get back wa fun making dough still felt bit empty nothing stop loneliness imagined someone could feed family family really know true self one doe wish wa someone knew true self could share life dessert family eating wish someone hugged would eat cinnamon bun maybe watching movie together thinking make want cry literally 0 friend one text anything since 8rh grade began literally one ever hanged anything always alone 2 girl usally talked noticed trying stay away want think right really know alive kind ruined mood sitting writing post wa distracted since written thing suicide might think got wave intense suicidal thought decided bake cinnamon roll
My upbringing didn't prepare me for life and I've been suicidal since the 7th grade.,"I was raised in a very religious household and went to a seventh day adventist school until my junior year of high school. I was bullied for years by both teachers and students for what I recently found out was asperger's syndrome. They said that I was the worst student they'd ever seen and that I should pray about it. The worst thing was when I questioned a Bible verse that I thought was sexist, the teacher didn't explain a thing and threw me under the bus. A rumor that I was a misogynistic asshole spread around the whole school and every girl, literally every single girl (it was a small high school) shunned me, flipped me off, got their boyfriends to intimidate me, they even barred me from entering the music building to get my trombone to practice.

Public school was great but then I went to college. I fell in love with a girl way too fast and she said that I was too clingy and instead of just breaking up with me she cheats on me. The guy she was cheating with (my fraternity brother who took me in during the break up) takes things too far when she called it off, drugs her and date rapes her. It was just terrible she left a week later and I never heard from her again. I tried to keep going to college but I just kept failing due to depression and missing class. I wasted so much of my parents money trying to keep going on. 

Eventually they took me back home and I went to culinary school. I immediately fell for a girl in my class, we were super close knit and hung out with our friends for a year. But I was so far in my depression that I felt less adequate the more I fell for her and I started missing classes and eventually dropped out to avoid her. 

I just want someone that I chose to love love me back, but when I find someone, my trauma with women prevents me from being able to even talk to girls these days. 

I'm 26 now and have been suicidal since I was 13. I spend half my time focusing on wanting to live and the rest either hating myself or drowning my problems in video games, d&amp;d and weed. I never have enough time to work on making myself into the person I want to be so I can confidently find the person for me. Hell I don't even know what that version of me even is anymore because I find current gender politics and representation so confusing (I feel weird and guilty just looking at a girl because I don't want her to think I'm a creep who's checking her out.) It's tearing me apart from the inside and with this goddamn pandemic I can't even find a therapist. I've been thinking more and more about suicide the older and more frustrated I become.

Tl;dr massive religious and social trauma (mostly involving women in my life) has severely affected my mental health and left me with suicidal ideation for over half my life.",chrispierthanyou,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhpa3v/my_upbringing_didnt_prepare_me_for_life_and_ive/,wa raised religious household went seventh day adventist school junior year high school wa bullied year teacher student recently found wa asperger syndrome said wa worst student ever seen pray worst thing wa questioned bible verse thought wa sexist teacher explain thing threw bus rumor wa misogynistic asshole spread around whole school every girl literally every single girl wa small high school shunned flipped got boyfriend intimidate even barred entering music building get trombone practice public school wa great went college fell love girl way fast said wa clingy instead breaking cheat guy wa cheating fraternity brother took break take thing far called drug date rape wa terrible left week later never heard tried keep going college kept failing due depression missing class wasted much parent money trying keep going eventually took back home went culinary school immediately fell girl class super close knit hung friend year wa far depression felt le adequate fell started missing class eventually dropped avoid want someone chose love love back find someone trauma woman prevents able even talk girl day 26 suicidal since wa 13 spend half time focusing wanting live rest either hating drowning problem video game amp weed never enough time work making person want confidently find person hell even know version even anymore find current gender politics representation confusing feel weird guilty looking girl want think creep checking tearing apart inside goddamn pandemic even find therapist thinking suicide older frustrated become tl dr massive religious social trauma mostly involving woman life ha severely affected mental health left suicidal ideation half life,upbringing prepare life suicidal since 7th grade,chris pier,2773,84,chris pier wa raised religious household went seventh day adventist school junior year high school wa bullied year teacher student recently found wa asperger syndrome said wa worst student ever seen pray worst thing wa questioned bible verse thought wa sexist teacher explain thing threw bus rumor wa misogynistic asshole spread around whole school every girl literally every single girl wa small high school shunned flipped got boyfriend intimidate even barred entering music building get trombone practice public school wa great went college fell love girl way fast said wa clingy instead breaking cheat guy wa cheating fraternity brother took break take thing far called drug date rape wa terrible left week later never heard tried keep going college kept failing due depression missing class wasted much parent money trying keep going eventually took back home went culinary school immediately fell girl class super close knit hung friend year wa far depression felt le adequate fell started missing class eventually dropped avoid want someone chose love love back find someone trauma woman prevents able even talk girl day 26 suicidal since wa 13 spend half time focusing wanting live rest either hating drowning problem video game amp weed never enough time work making person want confidently find person hell even know version even anymore find current gender politics representation confusing feel weird guilty looking girl want think creep checking tearing apart inside goddamn pandemic even find therapist thinking suicide older frustrated become tl dr massive religious social trauma mostly involving woman life ha severely affected mental health left suicidal ideation half life upbringing prepare life suicidal since 7th grade

I've been dead for a majority of my life.,"As I draw ever closer to my twenty-sixth year on this planet, I've felt the vibration of a familiar hum rising inside of my very essence.

&amp;#x200B;

I've craved the release of death for more than half of my life. I have tried many medications and therapies within my economic range and sustained the will to continue them, but as the pandemic rages on and the funds dry up, I am really starting to feel the futility of life. Why continue in a place where I feel unwelcome- in my own skin, my own home or the small city that I've always called home? Why continue feeling the pain of a body destroying itself piloted by a mind that's been in a similar state of decline?

&amp;#x200B;

There is no hope in life for me. Everyone left the boy behind to feel a man's wounds, then chastised that very boy for not being able to have the fortitude to deal with pain in a constructive manner. I've long since abandoned hope for greater societal restoration, or the idea that my life will contain anything but a variety of Skinner Boxes that dispense existential horror and brief hits of dopamine centered around fucking games.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't believe in a diety, and I don't believe in any sort of greater concept. I am an animal in pain, and for so long wanting to end that pain has frayed my sanity and alienated family members who were hoping for an easier, patchwork solution that wasn't so fucking horrible to deal with. Yet, whenenver I've gotten this close to the precipice all I hear is about how much my death would hurt them- and how the transferral of my pain was not justifiable.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck them. Fuck all of them. They'd rather let me rot away and show up as a performative socialite from time to time than actually let me express my own will and desire. I don't want to be this suffering beast any more- I want the humane ending that I deserve.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I wanted to create and leave some indelible mark but even that seems like a fruitless endeavor in an oversaturated marketplace of stressed apes. I just want out. I want to get off of Mr. Bones' Wild Ride. I'm done. To that end, I bought a shotgun for 'home defense,' and it will soon defend me from having to deal with the collapse of human civilization and scatter the home of my wretched consciousness into a nearby body of water.",NihilInPerpetuity,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhpnx2/ive_been_dead_for_a_majority_of_my_life/,draw ever closer twenty sixth year planet felt vibration familiar hum rising inside essence amp x200b craved release death half life tried many medication therapy within economic range sustained continue pandemic rage fund dry really starting feel futility life continue place feel unwelcome skin home small city always called home continue feeling pain body destroying piloted mind similar state decline amp x200b hope life everyone left boy behind feel man wound chastised boy able fortitude deal pain constructive manner long since abandoned hope greater societal restoration idea life contain anything variety skinner box dispense existential horror brief hit dopamine centered around fucking game amp x200b believe diety believe sort greater concept animal pain long wanting end pain ha frayed sanity alienated family member hoping easier patchwork solution fucking horrible deal yet whenenver gotten close precipice hear much death would hurt transferral pain wa justifiable amp x200b fuck fuck rather let rot away show performative socialite time time actually let express desire want suffering beast want humane ending deserve amp x200b thought wanted create leave indelible mark even seems like fruitless endeavor oversaturated marketplace stressed ape want want get mr bone wild ride done end bought shotgun home defense soon defend deal collapse human civilization scatter home wretched consciousness nearby body water,dead majority life,nihil perpetuity,2326,41,nihil perpetuity draw ever closer twenty sixth year planet felt vibration familiar hum rising inside essence amp x200b craved release death half life tried many medication therapy within economic range sustained continue pandemic rage fund dry really starting feel futility life continue place feel unwelcome skin home small city always called home continue feeling pain body destroying piloted mind similar state decline amp x200b hope life everyone left boy behind feel man wound chastised boy able fortitude deal pain constructive manner long since abandoned hope greater societal restoration idea life contain anything variety skinner box dispense existential horror brief hit dopamine centered around fucking game amp x200b believe diety believe sort greater concept animal pain long wanting end pain ha frayed sanity alienated family member hoping easier patchwork solution fucking horrible deal yet whenenver gotten close precipice hear much death would hurt transferral pain wa justifiable amp x200b fuck fuck rather let rot away show performative socialite time time actually let express desire want suffering beast want humane ending deserve amp x200b thought wanted create leave indelible mark even seems like fruitless endeavor oversaturated marketplace stressed ape want want get mr bone wild ride done end bought shotgun home defense soon defend deal collapse human civilization scatter home wretched consciousness nearby body water dead majority life
I honestly doesn’t understand why does ppl think suicide is such a bad thing,"Like I might sound inhuman and cruel but I’m just displaying my thought, I’m 14 and yes I’m still very young according to everyone and I might sound like some random kid talk but pls listen to me.
As a 10 yrs old, ppl around me always talk abt how much deaths are such a bad thing, and how my grandpa past away and stuff like that. And at some point my thought just became well... weird? I just stare at his picture for a long time and I just thought abt how he must have felt when he died (since he got cancer) and he died so he was free from all the pain, isn’t that a good thing? Ppl just wanting him to live longer while being under all those medicines and machines just so his family can be happy but he have to be like that? The 10 yrs old me just simply turn to my mom and my grandma thinking “How selfish” 
When I turn 11, I learned abt how overpopulated the world is and how human are ruining the planet, then I read abt murderer and ppl talking abt how much precious human life is. But when I look at them shoving a knife into an alive pig and taking it organs out while it screaming in pain until it died, I just thought “What is the difference? Human just a bunch of meat just like how everything is, everything die at the end so why does one live matter more?” Imagine the position were reverse, pigs holding knife surrounding one human, shoving it in the stomach taking everything out until it died then cook it and eat it while everyone is smiling and happily chatting. I honestly felt so sick in front of that, I was 11 yrs old and the adults even ask if I wanted to have a try at draining the blood and I was horrified. I ask them “Can you do it if that was a human?” and they were mad for some unknown reason, I honestly don’t understand. They all look like demons to me while calling me the demon and the weird one. 
Soon I turned 12 then I thought “Oh maybe I should die since the world is growing and I hate human either way and I’m a human so I should kill myself! Isn’t that such a good thing omg I’m so smart” and I told my mom abt my future plan which is that expecting her to call me a good child thinking abt the world but then she slap me and said I was crazy. I still don’t understand, why? Why are ppl so scare of death? Is it because they doesn’t know what beyond it? Is it because it painful? Is it because it a bad thing cuz everyone think it a bad thing? I don’t understand, that so strange. Doesn’t ppl get curious if they doesn’t know what beyond it? Yet why are they scare of it? That’s odd. Maybe I should stay for sometimes so I find out why, so I decide to change the date up a bit. I search the web, ask ppl but it still doesn’t make sense, I don’t understand their logic. What is the point of growing up, go to primary school, high school, uni then graduate, grab a job, marry, have kids, then die? The whole world live like that and they all are not bored of it. From my point of view, everyone seem like a bunch of sheep in a farm waiting for their death. They might be happy, they might be sad but honestly does it all matter at the end? U gain nothing from it so why don’t they just go and explore the afterlife? Even if someone died, there still be tons and billions left. Our family might be sad, but they won’t after some times, they will move on. And think of you only when they are depressed and want something to chew on. That just how it is. 
13 yrs old me trying to find a good spot for a good jump yet everything is block off? Why? Why are they complaining abt world population and human cruelty yet they doesn’t let us to cleanse our sin by death? Why does everyone smile and think they are heroes when helping ppl who are near death? For example, doctors, some ppl might want to live but some don’t, some of them have to sit in bed waiting for death since their brain are dead but yet ppl around them doesn’t let them die. That’s cruel. Human like to break, and break and replace and fix just like a robots, having an artificial heart in you, are you still human? We are fated to die at some point, yet ppl are trying to stop that, call yourself heroes or what it is. All I see is hypocrites dancing in the world so call “common sense” I might be crazy. I might be odd. I might be Satan itself. I might not a human. Call me what you want. But I still don’t understand, just why? I feel sorry for all those animals that everyone ate until they die at 100 yrs old or 80 yrs old or whatever age it may be. How many animals, how many lives have u ate to get to that point? Human live longer than any animals and are cruel than anything out there, yet some are labelled as “innocent” while chewing flesh in their mouth? That’s odd. I wonder what happen if those flesh were something else... Why does “murderer” only work for those that killed human? What is the difference between human and monkey? The power to destroy everything? The so-call great brain? Top of food chain? Educated? Yet so ugly and selfish on the inside? They smile but they might not be smiling, they love you but might call it obsession and interests more than love. They care? But it probably benefit them at some point, fame, wealth, how does they look to others, world common sense, etc... 
And I’m 14 now, looking at churches scare me, thinking abt witch hunts scare me, thinking abt what might be on the other side of that smiling face scare me. I’m might as well gone to the wrong place. How many things are happening in the world that u do not know of? Someone might be raped right this moment, someone might have pass away next moment, animals are being roasted alive this moment. And no one know. No one care. Everyone want to be the hero, but how abt being a hero to urself first? 
I want to die. I don’t bare any grudge in particular. I just don’t understand. My common sense are weird according to others. I might be a murderer, I might be an innocent high schooler, I might be a crazy bastard that needed helps, I might be no one. And hi, I am just a 14 yrs old child from Oceania, nice to meet you.",293839292,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhpnt0/i_honestly_doesnt_understand_why_does_ppl_think/,like might

every day is increasingly painful,"I've recently had to adjust to a major change in my life, and I think this caused me to go into a deep depressive slump.

Each day has become increasingly harder and even simple things just feel so hard to do.

"What's the point in living if you're an ugly, skinny short man?","Like is there really any point?

**I'm 5""1, and 19-years old.**

On top of that I have terrible social skills, zero confidence (for obvious reasons), barely any friends, never had a job, never had a girlfriend, virgin, never been to a party. I feel incompetent, because I literally look like a 9-year old.  I'm certain that I have undiagnosed ADHD, depression, and anxiety for obvious reasons.

I also have eczema, asthma, atopic dermatitis (my scalp and eyebrows itch), Hyperhidrosis, thyroid issues, and a plethora of food and environmental allergies.

I struggle with hygiene, because I have phimosis (a tight foreskin) and a tight frenulum so my foreskin can barely retract. I try my best to clean down there thoroughly, but it can smell quite unpleasant at times. My hair gets greasy so fucking quickly, and my feet start to smell quickly.

I'm not exactly ugly, because I do take care of myself, but I would be viewed as ugly by society. I have features that compliment each other, my skin is for the most part clear, I have high cheekbones, a chiseled jawline, a haircut that looks good. However, my head is small, I have big eyes, a big nose with a hump, and big lips. I also look horrible when I smile with my teeth showing so avoid doing that. **I've had some girls interested in me, but i've always been too scared to approach them in fear of fucking it up. I don't even want a girlfriend let alone a family anyway. My family is toxic enough, and I really fucking love being alone with no one to bother me. My constant mind-chatter, brain fog and depersonalisation are enough thanks... I don't know how any woman would actually want me, but I do not want to inflict such suffering onto another human. Fuck no, I never want to have kids. Why would you want to lie to an innocent child about how the world is all sunshine and rainbows, and when they grow up they see how sick and disgusting this hellhole of a planet is.**

**I'm sure a lot of you will agree with me on that one, cause I'm sure you've seen some shit way worse than me.**

It seems like all of my problems stem from being ugly and short. Could be worse though, but it doesn't make my suffering any better.

Sure, there are things that I can do to improve my life, but my life will still fucking suck. I know what I need to do to improve my life, and there are so many things that I want to do, but it just seems pointless. I hate the course i'm doing at college, I'm pretty much forced to work at my family's store because I live with them, and they literally dictate my life. I moved across the country, so I don't even see my friends anymore.

I just feel weak and like an alien. Seriously, when you're dealt a shitty hand, it doesn't get better.

I see people complain about being 'short' and they're 5""6, like that is not fucking short. Try being barely 5 foot. I can literally lose in a fight to an 8-year old.

If you were born attractive in the eyes of society, then count yourself fucking lucky. Life just seems like endless suffering if you're not born attractive, talented, or born into a rich family. It's just a genetic lottery. You also have to grovel and work a shitty 9-5 for the rest of your life until you die. I drift into a fantasy world and I tend to dream about being this ideal version of myself with the appearance that I would've loved to have, and living the life that I will likely never be able to live.

Reality hits, and i'm back to myself again... If you're an ugly short man nobody gives a fuck about you. When people say ""what you see on Instagram is a facade"", yeah right, because the people I see on Instagram (who aren't even models) women and men, are attractive and are enjoying their lives. Partying, travelling and constantly updating their stories. Stop trying to make me feel better. **I feel inferior to just about everyone, including women.** **I was the tiniest and lightest baby (in terms of weight), and I still weigh like 40kg now no matter what I eat.**

I don't even want to work a normal job (as I have ADHD, doing something that doesn't interest me is torture, and my life already feels like torture), **I have big dreams of being a singer or even a social media star, but i'm not good-looking or talented enough for any of that. I feel like i'm destined to be a wage slave, or even unemployed because I have zero employability skills.** I'm struggling in college too, because of ADHD and Depression. Everyday feels like groundhog day nowadays, and I feel like I have nothing to live for, and even if I do it's not something that will make me happy. I don't even remember what it feels like to be normal, I was such a happy kid, but now I just feel like i'm suffering. It's odd how we get so existential when the day ends, but as soon as we wake up it's a new day and we're somehow strong enough to get through another day of suffering on auto-pilot. **I'm not funny, i'm not talented, i'm not smart, i'm not attractive, and i will not be remembered...**

I hear people my age talking about partying, travelling, doing all sorts of stuff, but I do absolutely nothing.

I understand that people care, but please stop telling us to not follow through on our suicidal ideations. We all have our own struggles, and it's not as simple as getting help especially when you literally have no one to turn to, and we're still in a pandemic.

I'm not actually planning on killing myself, but I really would if it didn't mean hurting my family and the very small circle of friends that I have. I keep telling myself that it will get better if I follow-through on my plans, but if anyone here has ADHD and Depression, you know it fucking sucks. What a meaningless existence this is...

I realise that time is the most valuable resource in life, and that experiences and relationships are the most valuable things, but I can't have any of those things. I have zero accomplishments, zero memorable experiences.

I probably missed some stuff, but you get the picture, and I don't see it getting better. I'm just lying to myself to feel better at this point...

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Edit:** I also fucking hate my voice. I'm pretty certain I have inattentive ADHD and I can't even sit down for 5 seconds to do any college work (even watch a lecture, or open a linked resource) without wanting to stick my head in a blender. If you don't think I have it, or i'm exaggerating i'll give you a long list of symptoms I have to deal with everyday along with suicidal thoughts. I'm also procrastinating on an assignment right now, that's due in a few days, and I don't think it will get done anytime soon since I can't even get started. I can't open anything college related and it doesn't help that everything is online. I literally feel like smashing my head on my keyboard, zone out and say i'll do it tomorrow, and then repeat.

If any of my friends met me now, they would probably not want to be friends with me and would probably think i'm weird, because I would have absolutely nothing to say.

The list of ADHD symptoms I promised if you think i'm just using it is an excuse or if you think it doesn't exist. It doesn't help when you also hate yourself:

**The symptoms that I experience (As a kid I was hyperactive, so I feel like it may be a combination of both, or my hyperactivity is no longer physical but mental):**

* Heavy mental fog (blocked mind, it's like I have a wall stopping me from thinking)
* Mental clutter (overwhelmed by thoughts)
* I feel like I can't apply any of the knowledge that I have (I feel like I have a lot of wisdom and accumulated knowledge of philosophical shit, but none of it really matters)
* I'm scatter-brained (I jump from one thing to another, and thoughts just randomly pop into my head so I struggle to formulate sentences)
* I feel like i'm trying 100x harder than everyone else, but it's all mental work and I still appear lazy on the outside.
* Depersonalisation (disconnected from the present moment, reality, from myself)
* Stuck in my head (racing thoughts, feel like i'm at war with myself)
* Everything feels overwhelming even the most simplest tasks
* I avoid anything that requires sustained mental effort
* I can't follow-through on anything (I make so many plans, have bullet journals, I have 'potential')
* I can't do anything that is boring or that I have zero interest in, it feels like torture..
* I'm a chronic procrastinator (now or not now)
* I can't 'try harder' I just shut-down and give up as soon as I open anything up, and just feel like smashing my head on my keyboard
* I can say things impulsively that I don't mean because I'm very irritable
* I can't cope with stress
* I'm moody a lot of the time, but that's because of stress
* I'm very disorganised
* I appear to be lazy, but I'm always fantasising and thinking about doing things that I know I should be doing.
* Excessive talking (I finish sentences for other people, I have poor working memory so I try to say things as soon as possible before I forget them, I think quicker than I speak and come up with random shit)
* I appear to be listening, but i'm really just staring at your eyes and constantly repeating what I was going to say before I forget it, or I think of something completely unrelated.
* High or low in mood (mood swings, it's like i'm bipolar, my mood is so unpredictable, but it's internal so no one really sees it and I appear normal)
* I'm very forgetful (I sometimes even forget to flush lol, I also forget to eat a lot of the time)
* I feel like i'm motivated, but I don't at the same time. I also feel like I'm smart, but also stupid, because every time I try to do something I capitulate.
* I overlook details (I hate reading, and just look for the bold text, or skim through everything and overlook details, and then forget what I just read. The same goes for watching YouTube videos, I have to rewind a lot because I missed something)
* I make careless mistakes (probably made some grammatical errors here)
* I don't feel in control of my life (brain fog, follow-through, mind-chatter, it's like someone else has the remote control to my life)
* Hyperfocus on pointless things, and end up getting sucked into a rabbit hole.
* Time blindness
* I want to do everything, but end up doing nothing...
* Extremely low motivation (but it seems like I have the necessary motivation, and I just can't do the thing. I've always thought that it was a clarity issue, but i'm an over-planner.)
* I'm very irritable and can't control my emotions (I had a punching bag when I was younger, but nowadays I prefer to journal how I feel and cry in private if I'm sad)
* I'm extremely sensitive to noise (I get internally angry, and can't concentrate)
* Can't focus on anything that doesn't interest me
* I hate asking for help (I don't really know why)
* I hate being told what to do (I don't know if that's an ADHD thing, but I hate authority, but need external pressure or I get nothing done).
* Easily confused
* Excessive daydreaming
* Sensitive to criticism
* I give up and get discouraged easily, because I find things to be mentally draining.
* When I have labs at college, I will squirm in my seat, tap my feet, fidget and even think that it's time to leave when i've only been there for an hour. I pull out my phone and watch YouTube videos when I should be doing the work, because it's so tedious, boring, and I can't concentrate.
* I'm so easily distracted by my surroundings and my own thoughts.
* I tap my pen a lot, and itch my hands or bite my thumb if I don't have anything to fidget with (i have eczema)
* I have strong interests, I'm creative, and i'm very motivated to succeed in my own endeavours but I can't ever get started or complete anything that I start.
* Can't hold conversations (my mind just goes blank), struggle to maintain friendships.
* Obsessively do the same things over and over again like watch the same YouTube videos, movies, listen to the same podcasts. (it's like i'm trying to reinforce something that I already know, because I feel like I didn't fully process it, or I'm not applying it)
* I make notes about my entire life just so I can understand how to tackle the future, and have some form of control, because everything else seems to be falling apart.

**I probably missed some, but it was the same in high school. I feel like the only thing that could improve my life is an ADHD diagnosis at this point...**

I wish I was ready to kill myself,"I hate my life. I hate being gay. Most gay men are horrible, apathetic, just looking to fuck and crawl away. I don’t understand how a group of people can be so apathetic and cold. I’m 22, never had a partner, barely had any physical intimacy with anyone. Family abandoned me at 15. I have a couple of friends but they are often very busy. When I get desperate there is often no one replying to my texts. I live alone and because of covid there’s no where to go to meet new people. I hang out on the internet sometimes but spend night after night after night alone, including all weekends and holidays. My life has been pretty horrible since the age of 13. I missed most of my birthdays and Christmasses, there was no one there to congratulate me when I got my college results, or got into uni, or when I need support and advice. I missed out on all the dating. I’ve never been on a date, kissed or had sex with someone I actually fancy. When I look at men to show a hint of interest they look away from me in 0.2 seconds with complete disinterest as if I don’t even exist. I wanted to have kids and a family of my own, but I feel stupid even writing it. I don’t have any dating experience and no one loves me. The loneliness is really killing me sometimes. We live in a world where it is easier to ask for sex than a hug or cuddle. I can ask pretty much any stranger for sex and I’m not worried about rejection, but ask to be held and you’ll be instantly blocked. To be in a relationship you need to be not breaking at the seams, but how can I do this when I never have a support network no matter how hard I try to build it? When the only way to intimacy is cold sex with a stranger who will immediately walk out? And I don’t dislike sex, but how can I have sex with these selfish people who have no passion and skill? They’re just looking to release their load and go. It’s just about them.

I often feel depressed, bored, broken. I’ve had many therapists before but it never helped. Being gay has ruined my life. I just want to be dead or normal.
I don’t want to live anymore, but even though I feel near constant pain, I don’t feel enough to jump in front a train. Every method of suicide seems too painful and I just want the pain to end.

i hate everything,"i wanna either live somewhere with my pets and nobody else and not have to see anyone ever again except for close family. i don't hate everyone, i just hate that everyone projects their emotions onto me because i'm only a teenager i can't deal with growing up and other people's anger as well. i hate that and i hate that when i'm angry i can only cry because i wanna scream and break things but i just can't. all i can do is cry and i don't like that either. ijust wanna be normal. i have alot of potential with alot of different things in the future but i still wanna die and i'm planning on doing that once all my pets pass before me. i have pets that i refuse to leave alone, they're the only reason i'm alive at this point but as soon as i get the opportunity to stop looking after people and animals i might die. i have a lizard so that's still a long way away but maybe if my dad wants the lizard or i can't have pets wherever i move away to i can do it because by then my other pets will be old and my parents will know how to look after them well during their last moments. but at the same time i don't want to just randomly leave forever one day and then leave my dog with nobody to play with and my guinea pigs to have nobody that will just come out in the middle of the day to pat them or my lizard to not be brought into my room again. the only reason i regret getting more animals is because they're gonna live for a long time still and it means i have to stay alive for at least another 20 years which i really don't wanna do. i'm sick of everything and i feel like i have nothing left to live for. i'm scared of everything and everyone, i always have a reason to get in trouble and i can't let things go even if it was a very small problem that occurred. i'm not strong enough for this.",hotdogemi,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhqiu7/i_hate_everything/,wanna either live somewhere pet nobody else see anyone ever except close family hate everyone hate everyone project emotion onto teenager deal growing people anger well hate hate angry cry wanna scream break thing cry like either ijust wanna normal alot potential alot different thing future still wanna die planning pet pas pet refuse leave alone reason alive point soon get opportunity stop looking people animal might die lizard still long way away maybe dad want lizard pet wherever move away pet old parent know look well last moment time want randomly leave forever one day leave dog nobody play guinea pig nobody come middle day pat lizard brought room reason regret getting animal gonna live long time still mean stay alive least another 20 year really wanna sick everything feel like nothing left live scared everything everyone always reason get trouble let thing go even wa small problem occurred strong enough,hate everything,hotdog emi,1802,17,hotdog emi wanna either live somewhere pet nobody else see anyone ever except close family hate everyone hate everyone project emotion onto teenager deal growing people anger well hate hate angry cry wanna scream break thing cry like either ijust wanna normal alot potential alot different thing future still wanna die planning pet pas pet refuse leave alone reason alive point soon get opportunity stop looking people animal might die lizard still long way away maybe dad want lizard pet wherever move away pet old parent know look well last moment time want randomly leave forever one day leave dog nobody play guinea pig nobody come middle day pat lizard brought room reason regret getting animal gonna live long time still mean stay alive least another 20 year really wanna sick everything feel like nothing left live scared everything everyone always reason get trouble let thing go even wa small problem occurred strong enough hate everything
so it happened,"this wednesday i attempted suicide, just like i said i would. obviously i failed.
i tried oding on ibuprofen, but as soon as i took it i went into panic mode and regretted it. i contacted one of my irl friends (something ive never done before) and she immediately instructed me to vomit it up and go to the therapist with her.
i did as told and i went to the therapist. ive never been to one before, but i got perscribed antidepressants and they wanted to keep me in their hospital for awhile.
my mom is against it
she thinks i have nothing to be sad about
that im faking it
that im just being a dumb teen
that i picked it up from my friends

Hate Myself,"So my life is ok. I have a wife who is probably the only decent human being on this earth. Has never uttered a single bad word. I have a 3-month-old daughter. But all I can think about is how much I hate myself and that I've let myself and my country down. I was in the army but I don't feel like I ever truly served. I got shot at one single time and it was friendly fire. My truck got hit by a friendly .50. And I was asleep in the truck with the baseplate of my helmet (wearing the helmet) resting squarely on the barrel of my rifle. It wasn't red calm down. Bolt locked to the rear mag in the mag well. Anyways I didn't get shot at by the enemy, I didn't kill the enemy. My friends did. My friends died by the enemy's hand. Some lost their feet were surgically reattached and still continued to serve. These are the real men. I am humbled to have merely been in the presence of true heroes. People who serve a country that doesn't even give a flying F about the fight that they put up on a daily basis. I hate myself. I'm in school full time in nursing. I am a week or more behind on schoolwork because I cannot focus. The VA has me maxed out on all the prescribed meds I'm on and still, I cannot get shit done. I can't kill myself because I know that my wife and child will be financially destroyed and be destitute. So now I'm held captive by myself unable to carry out the one thing that I'd like to do because I know it will harm others which is against what I stand for.

I my parents are miserable. they have had a really rough relationship over the past 10 or 11 years. My grandma died in 2018 and I've been physically abused multiple times by my dad... I've been in the hospital multiple times because of my lack of managing my diabetes.

Ive been called by my parents a ""piece of shit"" and they want me out of the house and they say theyre gonna put me in a mental hospital. I don't respect my parents at all because of what they have done to me and how they've  handled everything with me... I don't feel like I'm loved and Im depressed because of everything that has completely fucked up throughout the last couple years... My parents think I'm just faking my depression and anxiety and they don't believe me anymore. Which the one support system I had is now gone... Even through the conflict they still wanted to help me (at least my mom did) I've fucked up so many times with everything, shit I say, shit  I do... I have no fucking motivation for anything... I'm a senior in high school, already failing... My parents are on my ass for that (which I can understand) but they don't take into consideration WHY Im failing in school. My teachers, parents don't care and they don't believe me anymore either... I'm not looking for sympathy at all ... I just want to be understood and helped but it seems like I'm screaming at a wall. I'm in such a bad space mentally I don't know if I can come out of it... I've changed for the worst and I just want to repair what's wrong in my life ... I have no motivation anymore for a future and no motivation for really anything... I don't want to work, I don't want to do fucking anything anymore... I feel alone and I really am at this point... I have no friends, I have no support or anything. I feel like my parents don't care anymore and they are just gonna throw me in the water someday and say ""swim"". I get yelled at all the time when I get in arguments about how I need to succeed and I'm basically a loser ""disobedient"" child and how I don't do what I'm told and basically how useless I am... I'm done with it and I don't want to live anymore... And when I get out of high school I'm gonna have a job where I'm gonna be fucking miserable. I don't wanna do anything anymore, Im tired and done, lonely and hopeless. Everything in my life is just going wrong and I have no where to go. I just want someone to help me honestly. I see a therapist but I just met her and my other therapists were useless... I feel alone and a nuisance on people's lives. I've put myself into sickness with my diabetes more than I can count... I feel like everyone is ashamed of me and I basically wanna just die. Nothing is meaningful to me in life anymore and I'm sick of it. I just wish I could just go away forever honestly.

My day today...,"In about 10 minutes, I have to get up, shower, shave, and brush my teeth because I have to attend a recertification course for school that would otherwise be so difficult to obtain, I’m planning my suicide around it.

Afterwards, I get to go to the emergency room, explain to the unit clerk that according to the doctor I had an online consultation with last night, I am experiencing a mental health crisis, and that I’m there, voluntarily submitting myself, to save myself the cost of an ambulance ride I can’t afford. I know exactly what will happen next, they’ll put me in the “day surgery” room, which is always funny to me because of the number of things in that room that one could use to hurt themselves, but whatever; I’ll get a medical timeout until a doctor decides that a reasonable amount of time has passed and my suicidal thoughts should be gone.

That’s the worst part for me: The waiting. I have suicidal thoughts every single day of my life. Every morning, I wake up and that little voice in the back of me head chirps in, “Good morning! Are we killing ourself today, finally?” I often think during these timeouts about how if I need medical supervision because I’m suicidal, then the hospital should just clear out a small closet for me. I don’t really need that much. Just a blanket, a pillow, and a bucket. They could feed me a sandwich once a day, or every other day really. I have some weight I could afford to lose. Maybe let me out for an hour per day for recreational time? I don’t know, that seems like a lot to ask for, so maybe not. It seems like a fate as good as death.

Or they could just let me fucking die already. I’m pretty sure I met the burden of suffering required to receive medical assistance in dying ages ago. Just write me a script for benzodiazepines - call them a “rescue drug” for anxiety or whatever - and I’ll go get drunk and high in the woods, the freezing weather will get me if the drugs don’t. Done.

Hello! I’m doing it today.," Salutations. My name is Rosy, and I’m 13 years old. I have been on this sub many times. I have a knife, and I know basic anatomy. I haven’t done all the things I’ve wanted to do on my bucket list, but at this point I don’t care.

 I have OCD and I’m on the autism spectrum. There’s no hope for me with completely recovering from OCD. I can’t stop the intrusive thoughts in this life, so I hope that I don’t have them in Heaven. I’m a horror writer that was working on a book, but I’ll never be able to finish my book now. I love telling and writing stories! But I won’t be able to do that when I’m dead. This is my goodbye.  

 To my parents, I’m so sorry. I’m so fucking sorry. I love you both so much. I’m sorry Mommy. I’m so sorry that I did this. I love you so much. I’ll make sure to tell your brother you said hi for you. I’ll be looking out for you in Heaven, if there is an afterlife. You’re the most, strongest person I’ve ever known. You been through so much, yet you’re still here. I love you, and please stay strong. If not for you, please do it for me. 

 I’m so sorry Daddy. I love you and Im grateful for everything you did for me and Rico. I’m so sorry for being such a fucking brat when I was little. I’m so sorry for giving you such a hard time. I love you. 

 To Rico, you’re the best big brother anyone could ever ask for. I’m so sorry that I did this. I love you so much. I’m sorry for being annoying sometimes. I’m so sorry for doing this. I love you.

 To my pets Doozer, Blueberry and Neru. I love you all. I’m sorry that I couldn’t pet you as much as I did when I was little, Doozer. Contamination OCD wouldn’t let me. I know that isn’t an excuse, but it’s a reason. Blueberry, you’re the best bird anyone could ask for. I’m sorry. And Neru, I know I didn’t have you for very long, but I’m sorry. You’re a good hamster, and you’re very sweet. I’m sorry. I love you all. 

 To my characters in my unfinished book, I’m sorry I didn’t get to finish your story. Even though I was the one that wrote you all into existence, you taught me so much. Hell, even the villain, Dr. Green taught me a few things. I’m so sorry your story will stay unfinished forever. 

I wish I could write one last poem or story, but I don’t even have the motivation to do that. I’m probably going to do this either this evening or tonight. I haven’t decided yet.

 Here’s my will. 

 I want almost everything that can be donated to go to charity. This includes clothes, old toys, books, etc. I want my handmade dolls to go to Mommy, Daddy, and Rico. I want my notebook full of poems to go to Mommy. I wish to be dressed in my short dark blue dress for my funeral with my hair in a bun. I would like everyone to wear what they like at my funeral, even if it’s not black. If it is possible, please read one of my more happier stories or poems at my funeral. I don’t have the motivation to write another story or poem, but I wish to tell one more story even when I’m gone. If it’s possible, please read my stories to kids at the local library or something. Like I said, I still wish to tell stories even when I’m dead. Even if they’re my old stories.  

 Goodbye and thank you for everything you’ve done for me. I’m truly grateful. 

 Sincerely,

Thinking of Rational suicide,"Well the title sort of says it. I'm not particularly broken and ruined like many unfortunate people are on this subreddit. My life is alright. Thing is, I've grown to drastically seperate my emotions from the rest of my personality. I see things very logically. I know thinking suicidal thoughts suggest mental illness, but I don't think that's it in my case. 

The way I see it: The universe continues on after my death, after any suicide. That's just life. And sure, your friend and family will suffer emotionally. But those emotional connections are biological adaptations which help us try to stay together. When someone asks ""What is the meaning of life?"" They really mean the social life. Life society has created for everyone in it. And that has meaning sure, but what does the real biological life mean? Well. Nothing more than to extend the species. And a suicide or 2 won't do that. 

After understanding what the social life entails and what it includes. I find I don't want to be apart of that. And well, the universe still goes on as normal after my death. So, this is sort of how I see suicide.

Some have asked me what about living for other people? And part of me finds an appeal into that, however when you take a solid look at the actions and behaviors of people in general. They are often nice on the surface, and underneath devious and mistrusting. They are, for lack of a better word inconsistent. To me, I don't see an incentive to stay around for my ""loved ones"" as I know they care about me for things aside from actually me. 

Dunno where I was going. But I'll.leave it here",GalaxyVoidd,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhop4h/thinking_of_rational_suicide/,well title sort say particularly broken ruined like many unfortunate people subreddit life alright thing grown drastically seperate emotion rest personality see thing logically know thinking suicidal thought suggest mental illness think case way see universe continues death suicide life sure friend family suffer emotionally emotional connection biological adaptation help u try stay together someone asks meaning life really mean social life life society ha created everyone ha meaning sure doe real biological life mean well nothing extend specie suicide 2 understanding social life entail includes find want apart well universe still go normal death sort see suicide asked living people part find appeal however take solid look action behavior people general often nice surface underneath devious mistrusting lack better word inconsistent see incentive stay around loved one know care thing aside actually dunno wa going leave,thinking rational suicide,galaxy void,1599,28,galaxy void well title sort say particularly broken ruined like many unfortunate people subreddit life alright thing grown drastically seperate emotion rest personality see thing logically know thinking suicidal thought suggest mental illness think case way see universe continues death suicide life sure friend family suffer emotionally emotional connection biological adaptation help u try stay together someone asks meaning life really mean social life life society ha created everyone ha meaning sure doe real biological life mean well nothing extend specie suicide 2 understanding social life entail includes find want apart well universe still go normal death sort see suicide asked living people part find appeal however take solid look action behavior people general often nice surface underneath devious mistrusting lack better word inconsistent see incentive stay around loved one know care thing aside actually dunno wa going leave thinking rational suicide

How a pro suicide website saved me,"A few years ago I was sitting on the window sill on the 10thof my dorm building, looking up how high you need to jump to die.  I can't remember the name of the site now, and I think it no longer exists.

Because they convinced me that there was a 28% chance I would survive that jump, most likely with a severe handicap.  Thinking with my luck I would survive. That night and many nights after I came back to that window but never could take the chance at survival. I looked it up recently as I've been having similar thoughts again.

I feel like i’m going to end up like my mother,"My mom committed suicide when i was 5 and i found her. I’ve been dealing with self harm and suicide attempts for about five years. I’ve been in and out of hospitals but rn i’m 4 1/5 months clean. 

This year I learned a lot about my mom. She had an extremely traumatic childhood, she was sexually abused by her adoptive father, and her adoptive mom denied it happening. She became very promiscuous in high school. Before she died she was deep into a percocet addiction.

I’ve also had a traumatic childhood (thanks mom) and not very healthy promiscuous behaviours :/

I feel frusturated because there were chances she could’ve gotten help. But I also feel lucky that i’ve gotten help. 

I’m diagnosed with bipolar 2, so is my brother, and my mom had traits. Can’t really diagnose a dead person. I can’t stop thinking that i’m going to end up like her. I feel like there’s this suicide magnet pulling me. It’s possibly genetic.

I know that just because there’s a family history doesn’t mean i HAVE to end up like her.

"18yrs old, ending my life in a few months, trapped in a life that i dont want to live, but i cant end it without hurting others and its annoying. not sad","my name is will, I am 18yrs old from Australia, i am currently extremely depressed and have been battling suicidal thoughts for well over 2years. I have severe acne and I feel hopeless. From about half way through high school my acne worsened, i had a friend group and I still do but I never fully considered them friends. Its hard to explain but people don't look at you the same, you feel the same as everyone else but I could tell I didn't fit in. No matter who i was with i would always feel alone, i would also struggle with conversation as I would always be in my head. I wouldn't finish or want to finish what I was saying because I would feel as if people didn't want to hear me talk. I hated school towards the end, I didn't attend graduation, formal, or any school events. After school finished \[about a year ago now\] i got into drugs, not hard drugs just marijuana, lsd, and occasionally dmt. I just needed an escape i guess. besides the point i feel as if the drugs helped, I don't live near town and just live with my father who is old now. I never have someone to talk to, so when my father would go to sleep i would just get high and talk to myself. recently i started going to gym again and have had some crazy progress, i have an excellent understanding of nutrition and bodybuilding, its my passion, i am well above average build and people would compliment me on photos but it would make no difference. Acne is just a deal breaker, nobody will ever get close enough to me or ever see past the skin, its just how humans are. Also to everyone that will give advice like go talk to friends and do things that make you happy, that's the thing, acne just doesn't work that way. All I want to do is hide, all my mind can think about is how i need to stay home, hide, and fix myself before I can go out and socialise and be normal again. But i have no clue how long that will be, its not getting better and I don't know when it will. \[I am on a non dairy diet and using proper acne medication btw\] Anyway point being I feel as if all I'm doing is wasting time hiding trying to fix myself, but now I'm even more depressed because I'm wasting my life. every time I go out or try to socialise I just remind myself of how I need to be fixed. 2 of my good friends have committed suicide and I know for a fact I'm next, I just cant do it right now, I couldn't do that to my dad, it would destroy him, a father should never have to burry his son. My life currently is just a mess and I wish I could end it all with no repercussions, I currently have 2 options. wait until my life is fixed and there is a turnaround, or wait until my father passes away so he wont have to deal with my death. It sounds depressing and dark I know, but it is what it is, some people are just different I guess. I don't feel sad about ending my life, and I am not depressed about the fact that I will be gone soon enough, I'm just depressed because I'm trapped in a life I don't want to live, but I cant escape without hurting the ones I love most.

Cold Raindrops in a Colder Ocean episode 1,"There’s this human in this ugly reality. His ugly reality. 
And he wants to go. Just go. Go go go! 
He is prepared and ready to go. Where? Somewhere not here. 
More specifically he is ready to die.. He wants to leave in that sense
He doesn’t want to be anymore.
And even if he leaves, he arrives somewhere else where he doesn’t want to be
Wherever he goes, it’s still an ugly reality. One he can’t seem to escape.
The only escape is in the mind.
Choosing a different destination - will give him a sense of direction.
Getting ready to leave and being on the go... Gives him peace.
Getting lost in his work - gives him some relief
And getting lost in distractions.. Gives him some time to think. 
Like in that “waiting for the download” meme.
It’s existential dread. One existential crisis then another.
Reasons to give up, outweighing the reason to try again.
Reasons to exist, being overwhelmed by the reasons to end it.
He is ready to go. That’s all he knows.
He feels like going.
He does not want to stay. Only go.

I'm not feeling anything right now,"I'm currently unable to feel any emotion, this the second time that this has happened to me.

I'm a 22 year old ""man"" currently studying (but starting to hate what I study), I have no job and have never worked before, I still live with my mother, I have a girlfriend but I think I'm losing her, I don't talk with nobody, I don't enjoy anything I do in my daily life.

Last two weeks have been horrible, my sister, my mother and I got covid and my grandfather passed away (not covid related, he lived in a town 7hrs from my home). I haven't seen my father, brother and girlfriend in weeks because of covid. Everything is getting better, but I was getting sadder. Today I talked to my girlfriend about how I feel, I was really sad all day, been crying a lot. I talked to her about how I'm feeling. She's telling me she feels alone, I tell her I also feel alone. We ended up feeling worse, and I got to the point that I can't feel anything.

I should be sad because I made my girlfriend feel like shit, but I'm not sad. I care about her, but I can't feel anything. I just found out a friend got engaged, I should be happy but I don't feel anything. I'm trying to cry but I can't get to feel sad. I have work to do for my classes, but I don't feel the urge or simply I don't feel like doing it.

Reaching out for help is a cruel joke,"I’ve been depressed since I was a child. The last 3 years have been a living hell though. What changed? I reached out for help after things got so bad I couldn’t take it anymore. What did I get? Suicide attempts, medication induced psychosis and mania, tazed by the police for having a bad reaction to a medicine. Weight gain from antipsychotics. No help from nearly a dozen medications I’ve tried. The hospital makes it worse and is traumatizing. Therapists, even if they help temporarily, eventually abandon you like everyone else. The hotlines are a fucking joke but at least they make me laugh at how ridiculously unhelpful they are. 

I recently have tried using the Betterhelp app and after switching therapists a few times I know for a fact that they send out bot auto reply’s and copy and paste bullshit when you message them... if they even respond. One of their therapists literally asked me to stop talking about something traumatic that I experienced because it was too much for them- sorry to be another burden you. Not to mention all of this bullshit trying to reach out for help costs money that I don’t have. It’s all a fucking joke and I’m in some kind of hell.",Minor_Theft,8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhopfk/reaching_out_for_help_is_a_cruel_joke/,depressed since wa child last 3 year living hell though changed reached help thing got bad take anymore get suicide attempt medication induced psychosis mania tazed police bad reaction medicine weight gain antipsychotic help nearly dozen medication tried hospital make worse traumatizing therapist even help temporarily eventually abandon like everyone else hotlines fucking joke least make laugh ridiculously unhelpful recently tried using betterhelp app switching therapist time know fact send bot auto reply copy paste bullshit message even respond one therapist literally asked stop talking something traumatic experienced wa much sorry another burden mention bullshit trying reach help cost money fucking joke kind hell,reaching help cruel joke,minor theft,1178,37,minor theft depressed since wa child last 3 year living hell though changed reached help thing got bad take anymore get suicide attempt medication induced psychosis mania tazed police bad reaction medicine weight gain antipsychotic help nearly dozen medication tried hospital make worse traumatizing therapist even help temporarily eventually abandon like everyone else hotlines fucking joke least make laugh ridiculously unhelpful recently tried using betterhelp app switching therapist time know fact send bot auto reply copy paste bullshit message even respond one therapist literally asked stop talking something traumatic experienced wa much sorry another burden mention bullshit trying reach help cost money fucking joke kind hell reaching help cruel joke
My birthday's tomorrow and I don't want to live another year,"The only thing keeping me alive is knowing that my Mom and siblings would be sad if I was gone, not because they particularly love me but because they'd feel guilty for not doing more to keep me here. That guilt hurts more than mourning or feelings of loss, and I don't want to put them through that. The other big thing is I don't want my Mom to be burdened with the expense of a funeral; she makes decent money but has nothing in savings and wouldn't be able to afford burying someone. If I ran in front of a car that could bankrupt someone if they can't afford to get damages fixed, and they might sue my family. 

Goddamnit I just want to die but I can't yet. I'll be 23 in under an hour and I've felt like dying since I was 8. I don't know if I can ever live a normal life, even with medication and therapy and healthy lifestyle choices. Being depressed and suicidal is hardwired into my brain at this point and I just want to die. Being here hurts too much and all I want is to be with my dead dog - he was my only friend and I miss him so much. Wherever he is I hope nothing hurts anymore.",991263006,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhooem/my_birthdays_tomorrow_and_i_dont_want_to_live/,thing keeping alive knowing mom sibling would sad wa gone particularly love feel guilty keep guilt hurt mourning feeling loss want put big thing want mom burdened expense funeral make decent money ha nothing saving able afford burying someone ran front car could bankrupt someone afford get damage fixed might sue family goddamnit want die yet 23 hour felt like dying since wa 8 know ever live normal life even medication therapy healthy lifestyle choice depressed suicidal hardwired brain point want die hurt much want dead dog wa friend miss much wherever hope nothing hurt anymore,birthday tomorrow want live another year,991263006,1096,60,991263006 thing keeping alive knowing mom sibling would sad wa gone particularly love feel guilty keep guilt hurt mourning feeling loss want put big thing want mom burdened expense funeral make decent money ha nothing saving able afford burying someone ran front car could bankrupt someone afford get damage fixed might sue family goddamnit want die yet 23 hour felt like dying since wa 8 know ever live normal life even medication therapy healthy lifestyle choice depressed suicidal hardwired brain point want die hurt much want dead dog wa friend miss much wherever hope nothing hurt anymore birthday tomorrow want live another year
I shouldn't feel as bad as a lot of you guys...,"I'm 16 and I've been depressed for like 3-4 years. I'm really emotional and I've had some experiences that really made me feel sick of myself. I was really aggressive in 5th grade and I still feel so bad about it. About a year ago, I had my first real heartbreak. It's not even big for most people, as I wasn't even together with her, but I really liked her since we first met when we were 8. This really threw me back into this big hole of nothing. I also got some new friends about the same time and I bonded with them really fast and there are two really emotional relationships, but it kinda seems one-sided. One guy, just livin his best life, the other guy, traumatised, cuts himself almost everyday and has only once talked about his problems with me. He still loves an awful person and I just can't help him, he doesn't want it. I really want to hug them but one hates it and I rarely see the other guy. They are really good friends of mine now, almost like I've known them for years. We're in a discord voice chat almost everyday mostly 4-10 people and they often just joke around about what I said for example that I'm going to kill myself. They make me feel real bad, I know they mean it as a joke but it still hurts real deep down. My life is just going downhill...
Since about a year I don't enjoy some games that much, my grades have been dropping a lot through depression as I can't really study and I feel like I fucked my own life up at an really early age. I feel like I deserve the pain and today I woke up and I dreamt about something that had to do with death. In quarantine I almost did a suicide attempt, I really missed my friends even though I talked to them everyday, I need to see them. I confuse my friends a lot when I try to explain my feeling and I don't know what to do anymore. Another close friend of mine is going to a therapist on Friday and I don't know if I should maybe go again? (I was visiting a therapist for my anger issues 3-4 years ago) My family has a lot of money problems, my sister who's even 2 years younger than me is really depressed too, our parents know about it... Covid fucked our plan of my mum working again to maybe move to another bigger appartement where we could have our own rooms and not argue about the other one being quite when you want to sleep etc. I don't really know what to do know. I feel like I shouldn't really be depressed. My self doubts are just big, some of you got completely fucked over. I often think about how I should end my life but I just shouldn't. I would probably start a suicide chain and ruin dozens of lives. I don't want y'all to suffer, please know that you're not alone. Lay back and listen to your favourite songs to calm down. You can just cry if you want, you feel free after doing it. But please don't hurt yourselves.",xReaperRaichu,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhsd0r/i_shouldnt_feel_as_bad_as_a_lot_of_you_guys/,16 depressed like 3 4 year really emotional experience really made feel sick wa really aggressive 5th grade still feel bad year ago first real heartbreak even big people even together really liked since first met 8 really threw back big hole nothing also got new friend time bonded really fast two really emotional relationship kinda seems one sided one guy livin best life guy traumatised cut almost everyday ha talked problem still love awful person help want really want hug one hate rarely see guy really good friend mine almost like known year discord voice chat almost everyday mostly 4 10 people often joke around said example going kill make feel real bad know mean joke still hurt real deep life going downhill since year enjoy game much grade dropping lot depression really study feel like fucked life really early age feel like deserve pain today woke dreamt something death quarantine almost suicide attempt really missed friend even though talked everyday need see confuse friend lot try explain feeling know anymore another close friend mine going therapist friday know maybe go wa visiting therapist anger issue 3 4 year ago family ha lot money problem sister even 2 year younger really depressed parent know covid fucked plan mum working maybe move another bigger appartement could room argue one quite want sleep etc really know know feel like really depressed self doubt big got completely fucked often think end life would probably start suicide chain ruin dozen life want suffer please know alone lay back listen favourite song calm cry want feel free please hurt,feel bad lot guy,x reaper raich u,2816,47,x reaper raich u 16 depressed like 3 4 year really emotional experience really made feel sick wa really aggressive 5th grade still feel bad year ago first real heartbreak even big people even together really liked since first met 8 really threw back big hole nothing also got new friend time bonded really fast two really emotional relationship kinda seems one sided one guy livin best life guy traumatised cut almost everyday ha talked problem still love awful person help want really want hug one hate rarely see guy really good friend mine almost like known year discord voice chat almost everyday mostly 4 10 people often joke around said example going kill make feel real bad know mean joke still hurt real deep life going downhill since year enjoy game much grade dropping lot depression really study feel like fucked life really early age feel like deserve pain today woke dreamt something death quarantine almost suicide attempt really missed friend even though talked everyday need see confuse friend lot try explain feeling know anymore another close friend mine going therapist friday know maybe go wa visiting therapist anger issue 3 4 year ago family ha lot money problem sister even 2 year younger really depressed parent know covid fucked plan mum working maybe move another bigger appartement could room argue one quite want sleep etc really know know feel like really depressed self doubt big got completely fucked often think end life would probably start suicide chain ruin dozen life want suffer please know alone lay back listen favourite song calm cry want feel free please hurt feel bad lot guy
Well maybe I helped someone else,"I'd like to think that I care about other people. Despite my dwindling friend circle (read: zero today, after cutting everyone off this weekend), I've been thanked frequently recently for helping people I cared about make decisions or gain perspective about their lives. Old friends, best friends, ex girlfriends, business associates, bartenders. I even helped a friend vote last week.

But now I realize it's after 4am. I've been drunk for nine days straight. I feel like if I don't do something about this now, I'll only hurt others more. I've taken precautions, I've deleted all my contacts. I've deleted all ""real"" social media. I can only communicate with people whose phone numbers I remember. I thought about cancelling my cell service to protect them.

I wish I wasn't so hyper cognizant of my surroundings, even when I'm completely plastered. I wish there was some combination of drugs I could take that would leave me completely functional but totally disassociated, so that I wouldn't be able to comprehend that putting my gun to the back of my head would be a bad idea, or rather that I wouldn't feel any hesitation in pulling the trigger.

I can only hope that it would be over instantaneously. I've posted before about how afraid I am, not necessarily of the pain but of the idea of lingering. I just want it to be over, I want to just be done completely. I don't believe in an afterlife, I'm relatively sure that it's just over when the chemical impulses in our brains stop. I just want that to be a complete ""surprise"" and completely instantaneous.",breakfastclubsandwch,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhpy1j/well_maybe_i_helped_someone_else/,like think care people despite dwindling friend circle read zero today cutting everyone weekend thanked frequently recently helping people cared make decision gain perspective life old friend best friend ex girlfriend business associate bartender even helped friend vote last week realize 4am drunk nine day straight feel like something hurt others taken precaution deleted contact deleted real social medium communicate people whose phone number remember thought cancelling cell service protect wish hyper cognizant surroundings even completely plastered wish wa combination drug could take would leave completely functional totally disassociated able comprehend putting gun back head would bad idea rather feel hesitation pulling trigger hope would instantaneously posted afraid necessarily pain idea lingering want want done completely believe afterlife relatively sure chemical impulse brain stop want complete surprise completely instantaneous,well maybe helped someone else,breakfast club w ch,1564,32,breakfast club w ch like think care people despite dwindling friend circle read zero today cutting everyone weekend thanked frequently recently helping people cared make decision gain perspective life old friend best friend ex girlfriend business associate bartender even helped friend vote last week realize 4am drunk nine day straight feel like something hurt others taken precaution deleted contact deleted real social medium communicate people whose phone number remember thought cancelling cell service protect wish hyper cognizant surroundings even completely plastered wish wa combination drug could take would leave completely functional totally disassociated able comprehend putting gun back head would bad idea rather feel hesitation pulling trigger hope would instantaneously posted afraid necessarily pain idea lingering want want done completely believe afterlife relatively sure chemical impulse brain stop want complete surprise completely instantaneous well maybe helped someone else
"wish the 84 benadryl killed me, a deathwish that didnt come true after all","honestly i dont even know whats going on in my life right now. 2020 has been a fucked up year. after spending 2 months in hospitals for overdose related issues, and 3 months in a juvenile detention center (ill explain why later), ive burned all my bridges and ruined all my relationships. its not that it wasnt my fault that thats how things ended up, its that no matter how much i do to try and repair the damage ive caused, its always immediately shut down because theres nothing to base any extension of trust to me on. i live in a small town with a very close knitted community. if you mess up or do something stupid, everyone knows in a matter of days. first i was ""mental hospital kid"", then ""benadryl kid"", ""jail kid"" whatever. its just so exhausting. clearly i struggle with addiction and i spend 3 months trying so hard to be better and i come home and all anyone cares about is my grades. i just dont see how its relevant; i would rather be failing and clean than a straight a student who's constantly on SOMETHING. i went to JAIL because my own father thought it would be cool to strangle me n shit- but im the only one who received any consequences cause i ran away. i cant get a trial w the case because of covid so i cant press charges for a while. nothing seems worth it. i went from a straight a student, who had hobbies and was passionate about so many things, on a road to MIT to a near-dropout drug addict who doesnt give a FUCK about anything or anyone. i want to feel different but ive been to treatment multiple times and its too expensive; my parents cant afford that again.

30F I don't want to do this anymore,"I don't even know what it is I need to say. But I have a few bottles of pills laying around and all I keep thinking is that I should take them all. I've been so unhappy for so long. I got married young, I was so in love with him. He was mean, and hurt me in so many ways that it changed me as a person. It's crushing to be in love with someone who hates you. You see it in their eyes when they look at you. You see how disgusted they are by you. There is no fixing that hurt. After ten years of marriage he left me for a co worker. Despite him hating me, and hurting me his leaving broke me completely. He left 2 years ago, but I have to see him every few days when he picks our kid up for visitation. My kid comes home and tells me about how they cuddle on the couch and dance in the kitchen. How he does all the things for her that I begged him to do with me. When he left he said I wasn't worth the effort. Him and the co worker broke up recently and I foolishly thought things might work out. How stupid. I know he hates me and I got my own hopes up.

Don't listen to them,"You have been happy for once in lifetime and nobody seem to give a damn? Well they didn't give a damn when you were upset. Well look and think logically they didn't give a damn when you were happy before. They just don't care. But ask yourself if they don't care why should you care if they care or not? Brother or sister who is suffering remember you can't expect the blind to lead blind nor the suffering ones would ail the suffering ones. Suffering leads to rage and only rage. Look at the state of the world. It wouldn't be the same if they listened more and talked less. They are full of themselves. Then they wonder when they are alone why nobody gives a damn. It's a circle. It's pathetic. Well i do give a damn about you. I bother to type all this because i want you to know that no matter how loud their voice is in your head they are all liars.

I felt useless today.,"I work at a grocery store. I push the carts back into the store. I'm supposed to be able to man the cashier station too, considering that I've been working there for over a year, but management never asked if I wanted to. I think that they think that I'm too stupid or slow to do it, and I think they're right. I feel bad most days at work, but today was particularly bad. The manager there kept putting me to work on pointless jobs (moving items to the front of each aisle, taking out trash that was taken out not even a half hour ago), stuff like that. Probably because they didn't want me around but they couldn't say that. And even then, I kept making stupid mistakes. I couldn't even tell anyone where some of the items were. I felt so embarrassed and moronic my entire shift. I know it's not much, but as someone who tries way too hard on things, I couldn't do anything right. Why can't I just do something right for once? Why am I so completely useless? I'm so tired. I just want to feel like I can do something without fucking it up every time.

i'm tired.,"some shit happened and it's really just one more thing that sucks about living in this plane of reality. i called a warmline (or maybe it was a hotline? i can't remember) for the first time just a couple of hours ago. i love psychology- i've studied it for years and am a massive supporter of making professional resources more readily available to everyone, as well as improving what's currently available for those who need it. like... i'm not one to trash talk the profession, and i just wanted to get that out of the way.

it was weird calling a hotline; i felt like i didn't deserve it- like i was wasting resources. the fact that the lines were busy didn't help- and i know that shouldn't be surprising, but it felt ironic for obvious reasons. in the end, i got ahold of someone, but the advice didn't jive with me- it was more of the same ""a lot of people would carry your death for the rest of their lives"" as if i don't KNOW that already. that's the fucking shot that's keeping me here outside of being afraid of coming up with a plan for something like that. being told about how much people i care about would suffer just makes me feel like the scum of the fucking earth, man. it makes me feel like i shouldn't have said anything, because i don't want to hurt anyone.

i don't know. i'm rambling and my mind is thoroughly frayed. i don't know what else to do. i sympathize with hotline speakers- i really fucking do. i know it has to be fucking stressful and depressing and overwhelming to constantly be exposed to people who are in a headspace where they feel like they're a danger to themselves- to have to somehow try to find the right things to say to someone turning to a complete stranger for help. i totally get that. it still sucks though, and it's frustrating. i'm just tired of feeling like this. it sucks, man. it just sucks.",ElJebusKrisp,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhlw9s/im_tired/,shit happened really one thing suck living plane reality called warmline maybe wa hotline remember first time couple hour ago love psychology studied year massive supporter making professional resource readily available everyone well improving currently available need like one trash talk profession wanted get way wa weird calling hotline felt like deserve like wa wasting resource fact line busy help know surprising felt ironic obvious reason end got ahold someone advice jive wa lot people would carry death rest life know already fucking shot keeping outside afraid coming plan something like told much people care would suffer make feel like scum fucking earth man make feel like said anything want hurt anyone know rambling mind thoroughly frayed know else sympathize hotline speaker really fucking know ha fucking stressful depressing overwhelming constantly exposed people headspace feel like danger somehow try find right thing say someone turning complete stranger help totally get still suck though frustrating tired feeling like suck man suck,tired,el jeb u kris p,1847,10,el jeb u kris p shit happened really one thing suck living plane reality called warmline maybe wa hotline remember first time couple hour ago love psychology studied year massive supporter making professional resource readily available everyone well improving currently available need like one trash talk profession wanted get way wa weird calling hotline felt like deserve like wa wasting resource fact line busy help know surprising felt ironic obvious reason end got ahold someone advice jive wa lot people would carry death rest life know already fucking shot keeping outside afraid coming plan something like told much people care would suffer make feel like scum fucking earth man make feel like said anything want hurt anyone know rambling mind thoroughly frayed know else sympathize hotline speaker really fucking know ha fucking stressful depressing overwhelming constantly exposed people headspace feel like danger somehow try find right thing say someone turning complete stranger help totally get still suck though frustrating tired feeling like suck man suck tired
Life is figured out and boring,"We know everything and life still fucking sucks and shitty people get away with power abuse and haness acts every day. I’ve always had a problem with suicide but I can’t ignore how boring and repetitive it is anymore. Its not a cry for help, I genuinely consider and entertain the idea of just killing myself since im an atheist. Life is so fucking garbage. I hate politics, I hate most institutions, I hate most the people in my area, I cut off all my friends because I hated them too. On top of that people twist facts and monetize information on the internet. Universal truth that most of us know is getting ripped apart for attention and money. Fuck life. Everything I used to love about life has been destroyed except for myself and sometimes I hate me too. Running out of reasons to live. If I died it wouldnt matter to me cause i’d be fucking dead so, either i start imposing myself harder onto the world or people start acting better OR i just end my knowlegable suffering and die in one go. I know so much i cant drink it away or smoke it away. It just wont work and i dont wanna be braindead, i wouldnt be able to kill myself that way. My father is an emboldened passionate sadistic racist alt right trump supporter who is psychologically manipulative, abusive, and forceful. My mom is a nice person but we live with a maniac. Some times she gives in to him and they both team up on hurting me. Im 19 and stuck at home because they wont let me go. Im so mentally abused i have no ability to do things on my own or inspire myself or be independent, i dont know why they’re such horrible people. I’m an ex pothead/drinker/smoker/xanax/shroom user. I cleared my addictions but nothing is better, everything is harder and it feels like it never improves. The people around me never change. I also am convinced masturbating is nescessary in my situation due to my mother’s sexually manipulative nature. Sounds odd but its true. Nofap redditors fucking crying to me about me jerking off made me delete my last account. Idealistic non understanding retards. I dont really wanna live any more. I dropped out of school 2 years ago and my life is fucked and going down the drain. Nobody and nothing is there. Life is truly horrible and i had it good. I dropped out because i quit all the drugs and it took a lot out of me. But now what? Whats left for me? An abusive trap of a house full of trauma and parents that literally scare me at their sight? Video games are nice sometimes i guess, biking is ok too, but aside from that my life sucks and i couldnt imagine going back to school but maybe  im just traumatized from catholic school. 

BUT THE REAL QUESTION IS WHY THE FUCK AM I POSTING THIS SHIT HERE FOR SOME NON UNDERSTANDING FUCKS TO SAY SOME SHALLOW WOW SAD BRO AND GET UPVOTES? Life is fucking hopeless. I’m just gonna break my phone and kill myself. 

My parents also never leave me the fuck alone. If i never reply or log on dont post this shit and make it public you attention hungry retards

Maybe a bunch of acid and a noose or a high building or a crane

Why are people so horrible? Why am i forced to masturbate and behave in certain ways to gain power so i dont get abused and exploited to death? Why is life, and more specifically my life so dogshit? Fucking luck? I wish I never existed, i would never wish my life on anyone. Its not like i’ve experienced historic suffering but. I will never recover fully.

I complain and try to negotiate and plead but it falls on deaf ears. Just let me fucking die

My life is over

LET ME DIE

END MY FUCKING SUFFERING

ONE OF YOU PLEASE

LET ME DIE

WHY CANT I JUST DIE

WHAT IS STOPPING ME

LET ME DIE

I often think of suicide. And that’s okay,"My life is okay, nothing to fantastic but I tend to think about killing myself when things get too difficult or stressful.

I have tried to commit suicide a few times but that was years ago and now when I feel this way I always tell myself “what gives you the right to leave?

i'm tired,"i think i started to realize how pointless my life was after covid hit. how lonely and pathetic i am. how broken i am.

i don't really know why i'm posting here if i'm being honest. i guess i just want to say goodbye to someone even if that someone is a stranger. i could never say a proper goodbye to my partner or my parents. one would be traumatized and the others would say good riddance. i can at least spare myself a pointless death and fade away before either realize what's happened. 

i decided to end it on my birthday. i can at least go out with a legal BANG as it were. i'll be able to buy a gun and i'll be able to drink myself into a drunken stupor. it sounds like a good idea in theory but who knows. i'm giving myself until then to get my affairs in order. saving up money to buy the gun and alcohol. 

i'm sorry to my cats that i rescued and raised. they are good and have comforted me through everything, but it simply hasn't been enough. my life is lonely and pointless. i have no friends, no loving family, and even if i did i'm sure i would shoo them away in fear of being hurt.

"I'm 18, and I should be okay","But I'm really not. If I look at my life, I haven't had it harder than anyone else. If anything I'm privileged to have the opportunities that I have had. I'm physically healthy, exercising up to 5 times a week. I have a few close friends, and even though I'm abroad I know I can count on them. I have a family that cares and loves me.

So why do I still feel so sad? And so empty? Why is the thought of ending it all so... there. I'm 18, in a beautiful place in a good university. But for some reason I can't handle the idea that I have to school-related work for 10 hours a day every day for 4 years, followed by the some 40 years of 8 hour shifts in the office. 

I want to cut it short, live a short life but at least it will be one where I can remember a few good things. 

Things have changed since I met my closest friends. I'm depressed now. Hopelessly depressed. I don't have the energy to eat some days, but I force myself to because I can't let depressive habits start to take over my life. I force myself to get out and about.

But the strangest thing is that I miss people. I haven't seen any of my friends in 7 months, and when I last saw them we thought we would be gone for just 3 weeks. I want the company of someone here. Not romantically, not sexually, just someone who I can hang out with. Someone I can hug comfortably and someone who I can talk to without the conversation just being pleasantries for hours on end.

I don't remember how to make friends, but I need someone. Just a hand to hold and a shoulder to cry on.

How,"I don’t understand how people stay alive and want to be alive. How people keep their faith in God and in people. I already had a hard time trying to be okay and be alive in general, but then divorce. Yeah boo hoo... you are divorcing. But I thought since I had such a challenging upbringing that God would give me something great in my life. I thought that was love. Surely love was the one thing that would make everything worth it and bring me the joy that I wanted and it was for years until it wasn’t. So I’m just questioning how I could try so hard and love so hard and God takes that away from me. Because “it’s all in gods plan” but why would this be Gods plan. To be wrecked emotionally...to want to die more, I’m mad at God and have lost most of my faith because I truly believed this was for me from God, that he gave me the greatest gift. Now I have nothing. I don’t care about a lot of stuff, or people. Because honestly people will be fine if you’re gone... they will be sad for awhile and time will pass and their pain will ease and they will be fine. I’ve always struggled to be here, and I don’t want to kill myself because i don’t have the balls but I’m hoping something takes me out. How do people just wake up happy and go to work, run errands, make dinner, take care of their kids, do it all over again the next day and are fine??? Everyday for a year... years...

i feel pathetic for this,"Its important you guys know the backstory 1st. In middle school I met this girl. We soon became very close and became best friends and at one point we considered each other brother and sister. I had family issues at the time and was suicidal but she was there for me through most of it we would red each other back and fourth. She was there for me when I started cutting myself she was there for my on my 1st suicide attempt and I loved her more then anything on earth I would carry her stuff for her and comfort her when she went through a break up or was upset. I made a promise not to kill myself and to live for her sake as I cared about her so much I saw her as more then enough reason to live I loved her as if she was my sister.

Then high school came around and that's when it all fell apart. She started getting really agitated with me for no reason would just ignore me when she was around certain people and would try her best to avoid me. I would try to talk to her but she would just snap at me whenever I tried to talk to her about it. Finally after 3 months of putting up with the BS I just went off yelling at her the confrontation ended with me storming off that's all it was nothing more just yelling.

The rest of the school year was just pure hell as she had told everyone I was mentally abusing her and that I had her by the throat against the lockers. Because of this I was bullied both verbally and physically one time I was cornered in the boys bathroom and was beaten against the stall by one of her friends. I would constantly be insulted and made to feel guilty about shit I didn't even do to her. At one point she lied saying I tried to sexually assault her and the police got involved but they dropped the charges when they found out she was lying of course no punishment was given to her.

It got to the point were I had to stay in class talking with the teachers who were the only ones who knew what was really going on after class and wait for everyone to pass in the hall as I was so scared of being beaten up or confronted. My now ex girlfriend broke up with me because she believed te girl over me. I had to switch schools the next year because I just couldn't deal with it any more I even attempted to overdoes on sleeping pills because of her.

But the torture continued as afterwards I was so traumatized by the incident that I developed PTSD over the situation if her name was even mentioned it would feel like my stomach would sink to the ground. I would also have panic attacks and mental breakdowns whenever I saw her again as even tho I changed school we still lived in the same general area. One time I was confronted by her boyfriend and he punched me in the face causing me to fall to the ground in the parking lot of the grocery store this was a year after the incident at that point. My own mother even said I couldn't be mad at her as since she was a girl in her own words ""I don't care what she did to you shes a women"" I wish I was joking. 2 years later and ive ran into her in public a few more times each time causes my PTSD and anxiety to act up causing me to go into a full blown panic attack. 2 years later and I'm still suffering from PTSD anxiety and severe depression from the incident. I recently downloaded discord but I signed into a old account and found the DMs my ex broke up with me with.

Need advice please,"This is the fourth time rewriting this. Sorry if it gets long.

I wrote notes to my two best friends, a gorgeous and kind person who’s totally selfless and everyone loves her, and a person who always makes me feel so valid and who I can laugh with and relate to on so many levels who’s so proud of themselves and I can’t help but be proud of them too. My older brother who relies on me to fix all his problems because he has a guilty conscious and thinks he’s bad, my favorite cousin who’s like a sister to me and who I want to have all my books, and my little cousin who I love so much, she’s my little buddy and I’ll miss her a lot. Also my childhood best friend because I feel like I have to even though our relationship at this point is pretty one sided.

I still have to write to my parents and my principal. Im not close with her, I just want to let her know that I wasn’t bullied and it wasn’t because of anyone at the school. It kind of is about kids at school, but not bullying. They just dont really acknowledge me anymore. I’m never anyone’s first choice. Even my best friends have other best friends they love and know better than me. It sucks.

I started rambling, sorry. I’m also writing one to my therapist just to say it’s not her fault and she shouldn’t feel like she could’ve helped me, because I didn’t give her a chance to. She doesn’t think I’m suicidal anymore, she doesn’t know I started cutting again. When we first met I had started my clean streak. I was at seven months when I relasped. I feel worthless because of that. Among other things.

She’ll tell my mom if I open up to her about these things, so right now we just talk about my loneliness and my depression and anxiety. She’s bringing me some papers from her hospital at our next session about making friends to try and help me. She’s trying her best.

I guess I what I asking is what do I write to my parents? I plan on doing it sometime in November so I need to have them done soon so I can focus on other things until then. I want them to be hadnwritten even though typing is way faster and easier so they’ll feel like they have a part of me I guess. Anyone have any tips on what to say? Thanks to anyone who reads this, though I assume it’ll get buried. I just have no one to talk to so I’m trying here.

Stress is killing me,"Ive had bi polar disorder for 12 years. Im a broke student and took too many classes (my bad) I'm terrified of losing money and have become completely catatonic and unable to complete anything. Im scared of homelessness. I'm scared society will fall apart. Im scared ill get hurt again. Im suffering from grief and still processing some  things that happened to me and my friends. 

some of the only hope I have is that I voted by mail and my family is alive. But I'm so tired of the pain. I wish I was never born because I wouldnt have to deal with this pain. I would have never had to experience all the abuse and fear and loneliness. My apathy couldn't be stronger than it is right now. Ive had 3 suicide attempts this year

It's so lonely when you have problems,"Hey guys, I've almost completely drowned in the swamp of hopelessness and desperation, at least I'm at the point where I understand that, however I'd like to live, nothing but more years (!) of problems  await me if I stay alive, but do you know what seems the worst part when you submerged so deeply down this swamp?   
It's loneliness and indifference. It always seems you are not alone, there're so many people surrounding you, every day you meet a lot of people that don't even know you, but in fact, you always are alone. It looks like the world is endless, pitch-black, ice-cold, silent space and we, people, are tiny, lonely starlights. Some people create a constellation, but even then this icy, silent darkness surrounds us, supresses and crushes us, because it is so huge and we are so tiny.   
From down here, you can also see how easily other people could resolve other people's problems. The problem may be unsolveable for you, but someone else could end it in a minute. Some guy kills himself over not having any friends - but some other person could just spend 3-4 hours talking to this guy, find out this guy is actually really interesting and reliable, and make a good friend, and no life would be ended. Another one has no chance to graduate a university - but he or she can be truly genius who just needs a chance, a help, and then he or she can literally change the world to be better. Third one has a huge debt with no hope to pay it off, but some other guy may spend this sum in one hour just hanging out, so the guy's whole life costed just one hour of fun of another guy.   
I've been in depression and despair, surrounded only by huge problems, for 3 years. Damn I even asked the Pope for help lol (no reply obviously). This is my shout into nothing, into emptiness. Maybe someone will hear and at least read this for his/hers own thoughts.   
I've got nothing but stress and problems for 1242 days. I was alive on 24.10.2020. I hope I'll get through it a little more. Every day is a victory for me, although I'll definetly not find my way out by myself - only new problems.

I'm at wit's end, and there is nothing here to hold me up this time, nor is there anything to fall back on. My health is deteriorating due to stress. I've seen many therapists, doctors, psychiatrists (no more meds for me), and by posting here, and telling you as bluntly as I can, I am hoping you will believe me when I say that I know this — a human connection, no matter where it is found — may be the one thing that can save me.

"I’m worried about my friend, and I’m not sure at what point to get his family involved. Please help :(","Basically, I started getting close with this friend a few months back, and we really click and started opening up to each other. A few months in, he disclosed that he was incredibly depressed and hopeless and felt that his life had no positive future prospects. He told me to leave for my own good. He also told me that he had a history of cutting himself and i know it’s true, because he showed me the scars. 
I know that he continued to self harm, although I tried to be involved and keep him from doing so. Recently, things have gotten really bad. We continuously have conversations that end in him getting frustrated with me refusing to agree that he has nothing to offer the world or a friendship. He’s slowly cutting off everyone he used to be good friends with, and swore he wouldn’t do that to me (I’m not stupid, I know I’m not different and that it was entirely possible that he might) and lately, he’s slowly backing away from our friendship. We used to talk every night on FaceTime or the phone but lately he seems to not even want to text. 
I’m scared because he’s openly admitted to me that he’s suicidal and a couple weeks ago drunkenly threw the phrase “soon I’ll be dead and..” into a conversation. I’ll be honest; I panicked. I started crying and asking him if he had any plans to kill him self and he said he didn’t even have any options to if he was going to try and assured me for the night he was fine. 
The conversations where he says he’s given up on everything and doesn’t care anymore and that his life is a dead end are becoming more frequent. He refused my suggestion of therapy because he doesn’t believe it will help. I have his address and his roommates phone number is case he tries anything, but I want to be able to help more than just calling emergency services. 
I don’t know what to do. I want desperately to help him but I can’t if he shuts me out then I’m left with limited options. At what point do I call up his family and tell them? He swears that will make his situation worse because his mother just died a few months back and they’re dealing with a lot. 

TL;DR My friend is suicidal and getting much worse. I’ve tried all i can to listen and be there for him, but it’s not helping and he’s starting to shut me out. What should I do? Would it make it worse to contact his family?

I have no purpose in life.,"I've been trying for so long to hide my pain but nothing works. I was 18 (f) when I found out I couldn't have children or my own and it's been killing me. I always had a dream of being a mother and doing one good thing in my life but it's taken away from me. 

All of my friends and family are in relationships and starting families while I'm alone. Why should I live if my dream is never going to be reality? I've been self medicating with whiskey and self harming for 4 years now (now 22 years old)  I recently lost my grandfather ( he had health issues like bad kidneys/ heart issues/ ect.) a few months ago and I wished it was me that was dead. 

I have his old pocket knife and it's been tempting to end it with his blade. If I can't be loved nor have children, why the fuck am I alive? Nobody fucking gets it and what's the use of life if it's to ultimately die alone with nobody. I don't know how much fight I have left in me. I've suffered for most of my teenage years and now my twenties. 

I'm a failure- an fuck up to my family tree. All I want is to live a decent life where I was happily married with a child of my own. Why do the shitty mothers are able to have children while I suffer with this? Where's your god? Where's a miracle when I need it? 

who would miss me when I do die? Nobody.  Therapy doesn't do shit, talking to people doesn't help- all they say is the same shitty advice I've heard too many times (try adoption, parenthood isn't perfect, you'll find someone someday, don't look for love, try being a babysitter/foster mom.) , my drinking  and self harming is giving me pleasure.",AnestassiaErd,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhkf02/i_have_no_purpose_in_life/,trying long hide pain nothing work wa 18 f found child killing always dream mother one good thing life taken away friend family relationship starting family alone live dream never going reality self medicating whiskey self harming 4 year 22 year old recently lost grandfather health issue like bad kidney heart issue ect month ago wished wa wa dead old pocket knife tempting end blade loved child fuck alive nobody fucking get use life ultimately die alone nobody know much fight left suffered teenage year twenty failure fuck family tree want live decent life wa happily married child shitty mother able child suffer god miracle need would miss die nobody therapy shit talking people help say shitty advice heard many time try adoption parenthood perfect find someone someday look love try babysitter foster mom drinking self harming giving pleasure,purpose life,estas sia erd,1610,26,estas sia erd trying long hide pain nothing work wa 18 f found child killing always dream mother one good thing life taken away friend family relationship starting family alone live dream never going reality self medicating whiskey self harming 4 year 22 year old recently lost grandfather health issue like bad kidney heart issue ect month ago wished wa wa dead old pocket knife tempting end blade loved child fuck alive nobody fucking get use life ultimately die alone nobody know much fight left suffered teenage year twenty failure fuck family tree want live decent life wa happily married child shitty mother able child suffer god miracle need would miss die nobody therapy shit talking people help say shitty advice heard many time try adoption parenthood perfect find someone someday look love try babysitter foster mom drinking self harming giving pleasure purpose life

I hate myself so much I fucked up my future and my life.,"I’ve reached a point where I’ve finally just given up on everything and myself completely. I’ve disconnected myself from everything and emotions. I feel completely empty. Not like before. More like a sack of meat roaming the earth waiting for my misery to be ended. I set myself up and subjected my self to shit that now gives me PTSD as punishment for the shit I’ve done to myself. Every time I fuck up, or feel shit about myself and don’t stick to my streak to break my porn habit, I punish myself. Shit gives me flashbacks but honest to God I feel I deserve it. I can’t sleep anymore. I can’t even think anymore. I can’t even be me anymore. I don’t know who I am other than a memory of what I was as a child. I’ve felt so pathetic and useless my whole entire life and I wanted to make sure my future self never got to experience happiness. I set my future self up so I’ll never want to reach that age. I’ve decided at a certain age, if I can’t turn my life around i give up, and I’m not near that age, but I’m rounding that corner quick and it’s sad cause I think about it every day. I drive to work and fantasize about turning my wheel directly into the barrier at 80mph+. I get excited when someone fucks up in front me and my life flashes for a second. I haven’t told people this and instead let it eat me up inside but I gotta get it out. I want change, but haven’t felt the strength to get out of my misery in years. I’ve just learn to live with it and hide it from others.

What's the point if you can't even think of a reason to stay,"
I don't know why my head has started to think this now of all times but here we go. 

I started thinking that ya know... with everything thats happened to me, wtf is the point anymore? Is it even bad? 

I don't serve a purpose in life honestly. I'm not important and I certainly don't and haven't had a great impact on anyone here. 
Im not really the smartest so there's nothing I can do there. 
My life hasn't been good and has only been filled of trauma, sadness. endless nights of loneliness, being trapped, no love (mainly physically, ex: hugs) the past, PTSD, self harm, and more. 
I've already tortured myself and my body to breaking points and so have other people. 
My only purpose in life has been to please others if that's sexually or emotionally and thats all its ever been since I was 13.
Suicide is not too bad the more I think about my life and how's it's been but then again, I don't have anymore memories of happiness from my past to help me as I've forgotten them all. 

**Lil thoughts that don't help: **

I started thinking more and wondering if I'll ever be able to get out of this house too but due to my mom and brother that seem unlikely. I've never spent more then 10 minutes outside. I've never been able to walk along the street to release some stress. I've never been able to just sit outside due to her not letting me because we live in the middle of nowhere. 

I wouldn't mind help and honestly I had a plan to do so once I get a job and a car but hell, I don't even know when thats coming. 

I tried therapy once but my mom was ALWAYS in the fucking room and sometimes even talked for me as if she knew what I was going through. I don't care if she meant it out of good will, it was awful and did nothing but hurt me more. So the thought of therapy makes me ill

This is the third day I've thought about all of this now and I've already started self harming a bit. Wonder what I'll do next. 

I'm not fucking happy, not in the slightest. I don't take my meds, I don't have help, I don't have someone who is here with me, I don't have anyone who understands to help... I don't have fucking anything. God dammit.

Everyone would be happy if I died,"My name is Ari, I'm in 7th grade, 

I'm non binary but I wish that I was normal like everybody else. Nobody wants some stupid attention seeking special snowflake, especially  in a small conservative town in the south. My mom told me it was just a phase and continues to deadname and misgender me on purpose along with my dad.

 I would rather die than be a girl for one more day. My sister told me you can't change your gender and never talks to me. I don't get to talk to other people even in my own house so I usually spend my time in my room surfing the internet. I don't have a lot of friends at school and nobody really talks to me but occasionally some people in science class will ask for help because of the smart quiet kid stereotype. 

My parents yell at me and tell me ""Why can't you be more like your sister?"" ""You should be grateful"" ""It's just a phase"". I can't even call the suicide hotline because I don't have a phone and the chatline never picked up even after an hour. 

Today, my mom found the bottle of pills I was going to overdose on and I made the excuse ""Its for photoshop"" and she believed it. I still have a scarf though.

Everyone at school would be happy because they hate me. My family would be happy because they don't have to look at this special snowflake everyday. My friends would be happy because they don't have to listen to my unfunny jokes.

I’m scared.,"I’m 24, f. After a few years of not hurting myself. I did it again after being left in an extremely emotional state because my boyfriend wanted to go to bed. Not angry, he literally just wanted to go to bed, which somehow made it worse to me. Every time I need help, people just leave. I’m in college and doing well in my classes. I’m afraid to tell my mom how I’ve been feeling because I know she’ll be disappointed that I have to stop school and take care of my mental health... again... in the same month this happened before years ago when I tried to kill myself. But I can’t kill myself now because she’ll be even more disappointed. I’m scared I’m going to hurt myself so I’m locking myself in a room. I can’t go to bed with my boyfriend because being next to him makes me so sad knowing he’ll never care about me in the way I need him to. He will never see the pain I’m in, even when I tell him. And now I cut myself again. Relapse after years of not doing it. My mind keeps flashing ways I could do it. And I’m so scared. People will leave me, if they knew what I’m feeling and going through- I know it. Doesn’t matter what I stuck with my boyfriend through, I know he’ll leave if I told him. I’m never enough. I spend my energy on other people and no one is here when I need it. But I guess I also pushed all my good friends away years ago because I knew they deserved better than me. I distanced so they could make better friends with people I knew they wanted to with, and sure enough- they are all much better friends than we ever were and seem so much happier. And I’m happy for them, but now I’m left with no one. Whenever I let the mask drop, it’s always the same. No one takes me seriously until I try to kill myself. I know that can’t be the way it actually is, but it sure feels like that. And tonight, I’m more afraid than ever. I stared at myself for half an hour in the mirror trying to see anything other than a shell.

Im never gonna be fucking normal so what’s the point???,"
Ever since I remember I’ve felt like I’m not good enough that I’m an outcast that I’m just no the same as other people. A month and a half ago my ex ended things between us after I freaked her out and was extremely controlling and manipulative, I literally destroyed my relationship with a self fulfilling prophecy of being a controlling freak. I couldn’t just let her be her own person, I always created issues and arguments and said so many things that were wrong, telling her I didn’t want to be with her in heated moments saying I didnt like certain things she did. Telling her how suicidal I’d felt and depressed, now I’m realising it was maybe just my way of getting sympathy, make her feel like being with me is more of a chore than anything else. I have so many fucking issues with self esteem and insecurities and depression that it just fucks everything up all the time. Any social environment with her if act out or act weird and make her friends and family question what was wrong with me, if I was moody or angry or whatever. 3 relationships where it’s clear I’ve been selfish, manipulative and controlling and pushed away the person I was scared of losing. And now I’m here, alone, dealing with this shit everyday regretting it all. Why couldn’t I just be a normal fucking boyfriend? Why the fuck am I like this? I’m so self destructive I literally do everything I can to get my own way no matter how much it hurts someone. I fucking hate myself, I just sit in fucking guilt of hurting someone I love and care about again but don’t seem to care enough when it matters to stop this shit.

The only reason why I’m honestly still alive is because I haven’t found the right body of water to jump in.,"So I’m stuck here. Around all of you horrible humans and humanity. Truly, I hate this planet and it’s people with everything in me and I’ve had enough. I hate it here. Life in itself is all pointless because when I die that means I’ll finally have to stop caring. So why care in the first place? Why keep “fighting” when it’s all going to end anyway? Why find “the one” when they’ll never be enough because you’re so alienated in this world. Why speak your mind and be your true self when you’re just going to be blocked and shut down by humanity- the very thing humans claim you “can’t” live without” and “need in your life to depend on” I hate all of you. I wish everyone on this planet would just fucking die because human beings are truly some of the worst fucking breed out there. If not the fucking lowest in the multi-verse. But oh- god forbid I start talking like this or else I just get fucking side eyed. You all fucking failed me and don’t even come at me with some “the world dosent owe you anything” bullshit because I know that very well. And that’s what I think I hate the most about myself.

I am just so very tired,"I'm 39 year old male.  Life hasn't been all that great.  I was born early, 29 weeks or so and I had complications in the form of a stroke which made interacting with people more complicated than it should have been.  Physical therapy for years etc.  I was that kid that didn't quite fit in, bullying started early.  Pushed down flights of concrete stairs, mass beat downs at recess, chased and run over by older kids on bikes.  Mental, physical emotional and later on sexual abuse from non relatives.  Add in a family history of depression, brain damage, PTSD and the like.  Life was never enjoyable, I've never felt happy or much of anything honestly.  Been in therapy for decades now, medicine after medicine with no real effect.  I exist but I'm not really alive.

&amp;#x200B;

3 years ago I got leukemia, out of nowhere and with no family history.  It was made clear early on I would need a bone marrow/Stem Cell Transplant.  They are the same thing just with very slight differences.  I begged my parents I don't want to get treated, I don't want the transplant.  I wanted to be done.  It wouldn't be a particularly great death but it would all be over.  The self hate, the sadness, the numbness it would all stop.   My mother begged and pleaded for me to try, she promised I would have this great life afterwards.  So I gave in.

&amp;#x200B;

Chemo was easy, didn't get sick from it, didn't feel bad.  I threw up maybe 5 times that was it and that wasn't until the 3rd round of chemo.  A few weeks after the transplant a complication came up.  GVHD.  Leukemia causes your immune system to fail.  You basically become an AIDS patient, infection kills you.  With a transplant you kill off your broken immune system and get a new one.  It's an immune system transplant.  With GVHD the new immune system attacks you.  There's no way of knowing if it will happen, or why.  There's no cure, just quasi management of the symptoms and that causes its own issues.

&amp;#x200B;

It destroyed my eyes, I can no longer produce tears or lubricate my eyes.  I am on a good half dozen eye medications ranging from drops/ointments/pills.  One of the treatments is steroids, which gave me bone damage and cataracts, which I had one operated on, the other considered inoperable.  So I have one eye with the cataract that can see close, the other set is for distance.  I tried to get glasses so I could use the operated eye but I was told my eyes are too damaged to get a prescription.  Pretty bad light sensitivity.  I sit in the dark most of the day.  Light is uncomfortable.  Contrast especially.  I loved to read but I can't stand to look at the white pages of a book anymore

&amp;#x200B;

I loved exercise, boxing/crossfit/group classes, running tough mudders.  I've lost 60% of my lung function.  I struggle to climb a flight of stairs now.  The only way I could ever regain a physical life style is a lung transplant.  I hooked up a heavy bag I could bang around and started to see flashing lights and shadows.  The damage to my eyes from treatment has resulted in the gel in my eyes which hold things in place to begin to deteriorate.  So any activity that is impactful can lead to retinal detachment so I had to stop that.

&amp;#x200B;

I was a photographer, landscape/fine art.  The kind nobody really cares about, but I good at it, I liked it..I can't operate the camera anymore, I can't see the readouts or the controls and not to mention with the economy blown up everyone is focused on survival, not on something pretty.

&amp;#x200B;

I never had real friends to speak of.  When I started exercising and doing OCR races I found a group which seemed to like me.  They were there for me in the beginning when I was sick but when it became clear that I wasn't going to be magically be better, everyone started to disappear.  People I've known for half a decade plus just vanished.  Don't respond to messages.  I've had to live with my parents for the past 3 years, I will always have to live with them when they die.  Nursing home I suppose, some kind of assisted living thing.  

&amp;#x200B;

I've had to live a Covid existence for the past 3 years, that will always be the case.  I will never walk the streets of Chicago again or go camping or skydive or go inside a gym, or read a book or live on my own.  

The world isn't meant for people who are sick.  People don't like people who are sick.  It makes them uncomfortable, so they pull away.  I've been left alone to deal with my illness.  Then my mother got diagnosed with skin cancer.  Now my father has cancer, and I'm left to deal with all of this by myself.  I tried support groups but there are none for GVHD.  It's a rare condition.  I tried normal cancer groups but told I shouldn't come back because I didn't fit in. 

&amp;#x200B;

I found a euthanasia clinic in Switzerland.  You don't need to be terminal, just a reduced quality of life.  I talked to them, I qualify but due to Covid they aren't allowing people in.  Who knows when that will change..if ever.  If I had that option available that I could say..enough and I could just disappear.  But my mother demands I live so she doesn't have to feel bad.  She's admitted that this was a failure but I must endure to keep her happy.   I've thought about stepping in front of a train or a truck but I don't want to cause a problem and ruin some persons day..so I don't go that route.  Since my last visit to the hospital I'm now looking at some form of thyroid cancer and surgery.  I'm tired.  I'm very vulnerable to pneumonia.  Dying from illness will be less painful for my parents then finding me hanging from something.  So I plan to gradually put myself more and more at risk to try and get myself sick enough that I cannot recover.  There used to be an abandoned factory about 30 miles away in the woods.  If it's still there, exploring it should be enough to tip me over the edge.  I've had pneumonia before and it nearly killed me and that's when my lungs were healthy.  It's awful..but it should work..and I can rest",Chi847,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhmmst/i_am_just_so_very_tired/,39 year old male life great wa born early 29 week complication

I am truly helpless and don't have will or strength to change things,The only hope I had at being a normal decent person was leaving my family. When everything went to shit the only people I had left were... my family. To normalize and incubate every toxic trait I have. They will only wait until I'm over it. They'll say that I need to pray more and wait for god to show me the way. They'll say that they don't have friends either so I'll be okay. There is no compassion in their voices because they are all suffering with things they've avoided to confront. I do not blame them but I cannot escape them. Being around them triggers me and I still don't understand why. Every time I'm around them I'm very reserved and anxious.

I want to kill myself tonight.,"I really do. I want it to happen. It probably won't, but if it could happen, I would do it in a heartbeat.

&amp;#x200B;

I was already feeling worse than usual for whatever reason. Sometimes it just happens. But then I learned that All-State band, choir and orchestra results came out for my state. I used to have dreams of making All-State, but they were dashed after I got braces which messed up my trumpet playing. So one of my friends said how she was so excited to get into All-State choir, so I told them about my dreams of making it and how they were dashed. A few minutes later, her sister talks in a different group and says that people should congratulate my friend. I started to talk about my All-State dreams again, since these were different people, and I wanted them to know how they impacted me, but she cut me off and said ""OP, please, not right now. She worked really hard and your conversation drifted away from that really quickly.""

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why, but that hit me really hard. I immediately blocked that person, and self-harmed, worse than I ever have before. I stopped talking to everyone for that night (which didn't matter, nobody tried talking to me anyways), and after I self-harmed, I searched around my house for anything I could possibly use to kill myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I can't find anything that would be lethal, and my fear of surviving but being disabled for the rest of my life is also just another thing that's holding me back. So it probably won't happen, but not only do I want to be thought of fondly for once (because that will only happen when I'm dead, most of my friends don't even care about me to check in on me), but I also want my friend's sister to live with the knowledge that she drove me to almost kill myself.

Its okay not to care, especially after two years. We’ve both ‘moved on’.

WE ALL GO BYE BYE,"[warning: very nihilistic]

There is no real empathy and love is a tired whore. 
I feel disgust towards my own being. 

No one cares about anyone. Everyone always places themselves first. Everyone borns together and dies alone. It's very cruel that we have to watch our own life-giver die. 

I think life is black comedy. Every time something stabilizes is when a rugpull is about to happen. It gets ready for war, while we're at peace with it. Life shows no mercy. No one ever ""gives up"" yet everyone always loses. Staying alive forever is an even worse scenario. We just can't win. 

There is no meaning to our suffering or to anything. No one ever witnessed any real proof that we're meant to be everything or nothing at all. Life is not real, is just a theory created by ourselves to pretend that we're somewhere while we are nowhere to be found. It's science fiction. No one likes life. It's just a terrifying downward spiral for everyone.

Suicide is an escape and a shortcut to the background world beyond the forth wall. We can choose to die and end this right here and now.
So why would we keep on living?

Thoughts,"Sometimes it feels like I have ""terminal depression"". I've felt this way since I was in elementary school. There's so much trauma that I am paralyzed by. I feel permanently marked by it. People can tell I'm fading away, I think. I don't know how to stop it. I suspect I have undiagnosed neurological issues or a neurodiversity. I've tried to go to doctors about it but my problems will always be attributed to my depression. I have trouble doing everything, even speaking. I find myself slurring my words and being unable to orient myself throughout the day. Everyone around me thinks I'm just lazy. I've been a disorganized cluster fuck from the beginning and people get tired of it. 

I don't foresee my quality of life getting any better. I put in so much effort into not even being enough, I can't imagine ever being able to support myself enough to get out of my environment on my own. It is so embarrassing relying on others and not being able to explain WHY I can't seem to function. I just want to stop being a burden to others.

I just want to talk to someone,"Everyone always says “it gets better” and I believe that statement for the most part, but I don’t think I want to wait any longer. 

Just like for most people, 2020 has been one of of the worst years of my life but not because of covid but because of an assortment of things. In March my grandma was diagnosed with ALS, and 3 months later she died. I’ve never dealt with an immediate family member death so it hit me pretty hard. I miss her so much and I think about her all the time, and I feel so guilty for not spending enough time with her. I used to go to her house every day when I was younger, but as I got older I started to become more and more distant because I was becoming more and more depressed. But now she’s gone and I can never tell her I love you again, or bake with her, or anything. She’s just gone. Like what the actual fuck. How does someone get diagnosed with ALS and then die 3 months later!?!? I thought it was supposed to be at least a year. I thought she was going to see me finish this semester of school, but nope, nothing. Anything I do now she will never know and that hurts to think about. ALS has taken so many lives in my family and my dad has a 50% of getting it, so with my luck he will also probably die from ALS.

I also just lost all the money that I have been saving to buy my dream camera. I’ve been working 30 hours almost every week for the past few years to pay off medical bills, to pay for school , and to just live while going to school full time. I’ve been working so hard and I’m physically and mentally exhausted. I finally saved enough money to buy a decent camera only to get scammed... 

I honestly don’t even know how to process it. I got scammed Tuesday and I haven’t been able to think about anything other than that or suicide for the past few days. I have been a screaming crying mess because I am just so fucking hurt and I feel so dumb for letting this happen. I was so excited to get this camera, and I thought it was going to be a turning point in my life. All my years of hard work for absolutely nothing. I just can’t believe the money is gone and I have nothing to show for... 

I was also supposed to go back home to Colorado recently to celebrate my little sister’s bday. I haven’t seen her in a year and I really miss her. She was so excited to see me but my boss denied my vacation request. I’m just so hurt because my sister invited everyone in her class to come to her bday party and no one showed up. I can only imagine the pain she went through to have no friends celebrate the one day out of the year that’s supposed to be happy and stress free. I’m so hurt for her because I know exactly what it’s like to have no-one show up. I wouldn’t want to wish that feeling on anyone. It sucks not having anyone to talk all day every day.

I can't speak.,"Ever since I was a child, I've had a stutter. Not a mild one, think of the Kings Speech; that one hits closer to home.

I spent my school life listening to everyone chat, laugh, sing, whisper, but could never do it myself. I would sit in the classroom, at my allocated spot at the table hearing questions being thrown out to the room which I knew the answer to; and beyond all other wanting in that moment, all I craved was to raise my hand and answer it like a normal school boy would.

I just couldn't.

Instead I would sit there within my impenetrable silent bubble I'd found myself in, and daydream of a future where I would become an adult and have a happy life, my stutter non-existent. 

Ten years later I'm an adult with a medicore job, with some great friends of whom I'm very lucky to have. My family, friends, and colleagues all know of my affliction, but as they do not have one themselves, all they see is someone with a mundane speech impediment who needs a little longer to ""get his words out"". 

They, and I assume most people who can speak fluently and articulatory without hindrance don't understand or realise the mental and emotional turmoil it can create.  In this day and age everything is based around communication. Want to apply for a job? Sit down for an hour in front of two people and answer questions on you why you want to spend your free precious time filling up the cheeses on aisle six for pennies.  Need cancel a subscribion? Buy a house? doctors appointment? Give them a ring only to have them hang up when they think that nobody is there because you can't say a simple ""Hello"". 

Or perhaps you want to go to the shops to buy a new coffee machine, when the nice lady walks up to you and asks you if you need any help today, completely unaware of the battle which is raging deep down inside of you. Struggling to breathe, facial contortions, colour shifting from milky white to beetroot red. Being so aware of every millisecond that passes, and just before the words come out finally, you realise that she is looking at you funny, with a hint of fear.

It's degrading. Humiliating. Demasculating. Knowing that I am of sound mind just trying to get by with life, but whenever I need to speak to someone, they think something is wrong in my head and avoid me. I go from the friendly looking chap standing by the toasters to someone they regret walking over to because I ""am not acting normal"". And worse of all? The hardest thing for me to say is ""stutter"". So I can't even tell people what's going on so they never realise.

Every waking hour of my life is dedicated to my stutter. It's always there looming behind every choice I make. It's an invisible disease, eating away at confidence from the inside out until a shallow husk remains; filled only with anxiety with lost dreams and opportunities. If this is to be my life, then it is not worth living. Watching peers around you progress and move up to a better life, when I can't even make a phone call without being hung up on.

Suicide has always been in a different reality to me. Seemed too far away or unrealistic to see it properly. However as time goes on I can only see a very bleak future for me in this life.

Depression is a friendship killer,"I lost 95% of the bonds I used to have, thanks to depression, social anxiety and that misdiagnosis...

Most of my social skills died out as well, or maybe I never really had them...

I ghosted people, I have ghosted so many people... I didn't have the freaking guts to say what I really wanted, so in order to avoid feeling pain, I ignored the problems...

And now, I'm almost alone... Not completely thanks to God, but I've still lost a huge part of my heart...

It was because of many bad habits I had.

I liked to pinch people's face cheeks and pat them in the head as a way to show I cared for them, but that made them feel uncomfortable, and it took me YEARS to realize that...

That's why people thought I was an **r-word**... Or at least one of those reasons.

I only have three semesters of classes left (since the fourth is just the thesis and internships), and I'm not really close to a single person there.

Aside from 2-3 people whom I'm maybe casual friends, I'm not close to anyone there, just classmates or they only talk to me when we're face to face, but that's it.

There are days when I can ignore the guilt and burning regrets inside of me, but they're always there...

I lost them, I lost them, I broke promises, I abandoned people, I became so annoying and stupid that I made people hate me, or drift away from me...

Suicide hotlines create more distance,"I've leaned on the suicide hotline many times in my life, and what I've realized is that most of the interactions feel artificial because they are. Things for the most part are scripted--or at least in a sense of ""I'm required to respond in this general manner, if said person exhibits such and such behavior."" You're met with that immediately. I'm not saying there aren't exceptions because gems exist in every field, but they are so few and far between. If we are being honest, a good portion of the volunteers, or even paid staff, are in it for generating the experience they need to put on a CV coupled with a letter of recommendation. I know this because I spent 7 months volunteering for one. People will adamantly post counter arguments or say things as callous as ""well you used the service and you're alive right?"" That's beside the point. I wouldn't be calling if I wanted to follow through my thoughts. I'm calling, just like so many others, because I want to have a genuine connection with someone, not to make a plan that no one who is seriously suicidal would fall back on. It isn't helpful, besides insulating you from meeting the person where they are emotionally at. That and making the company less liable. You leave the person more defeated than when they picked up the phone. 

There's this strange phenomenon that occurs among a select population of professional counselors: they feel after having obtained licensure and meeting all the training criteria, that they are less empathetic and equipped to help others in need. I feel this is somewhat applicable here: ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) strips you of your human element. There's an immeasurable perceptible component to empathy that can't be trained, and that's genuine responses. Of course each person is going to differ in how they connect with someone, or what they respond with, but how genuine they are is always being evaluated by something in us. I can't point directly to this intangible aspect of experience, but we all feel it to a certain extent. Now we could argue over the accuracy of how we evaluate others, but that's no really addressing what's happening on a call: there is a person in need, a person who feels isolated, and what they are longing for is some shared emotional space. They desperately want a connection. How often do we mirror their emotion? And I don't mean restating what they've said in different terms. I can do that all day, and have it be just as lifeless as a text lacking in tonality. We fall back on these methods for empathizing with others, and forget that sometimes the intuitive response will bridge that connection the person needs.

I haven’t been happy since I was a child.,"I have the occasional good day, sure, but overall I’m a miserable, pathetic excuse for a person. Im socially inept. I can carry on a conversation, but I haven’t had any friends since middle school. I’m literally getting dumber by the day. I stumble and mix up words and my vocabulary has gotten worse. 

As a kid I was smart, creative, outgoing, funny... I had lots of friends. I felt close to my family and looked forward to the future. At age 12 my entire personality just flipped completely and has gotten worse over time.

hey,"i have no where to go and no friends to talk to so being the gen z’er i am..... hello reddit. 

this shit sucks, being suicidal sucks. life fucking sucks. 

not too long ago i asked my mom, “what was the worst thing you’ve ever seen me do?” her response was “hearing you cry and talking about wanting to kill yourself at nine years old”. Little does she know that was the age of my first attempt... my brother walked in. for as long as i can remember I’ve been depressed. And I know that sounds basic and super stereotypical but I’m not playing .... as. long. as. i. can. remember.
I’ve never been treated for anything, we don’t have the money or insurance for therapy or meds. I just smoke to make myself feel better. But that’s starting to work against me and I can tell. 

I wake up sad, go to bed sad, get upset at myself for having little to no friends, get upset at myself for being so sad, get upset with myself for being so judge mental about my mind and body. My moods swing like crazy but GOD DAMN I’m always sad. It’s so fucking annoying. I don’t even know what it feels like to be happy, to be debt free, to not have to worry about the future. I wish I could just sit back and relax and be content with life but there’s nothing good about this life right now. My mom used to be who I turned to but she just got divorced (for the 3rd time) and picked up drinking again. She’s mean. She has no empathy. But, she’s also suicidal. That’s one thing her and I are on the same page about. Moral of the story: my suicidal alcoholic mother can’t help me with my mental health. I’m running out of options. And I know that because my intrusive thoughts have started to become way worse. Scripting lines of my suicide not in my head for minutes on end. Fantasizing about my mom finding me dead in a closet, and immediately collapsing into tears. How I’m going to do it.... what I’m going to do it with, who I’m going to say good bye to before hand. So many fucking thoughts. Unhealthy thoughts at that. 

Something that I feel separates me from the others is that I’m against suicide. To me it’s selfish, I could never, would never do that to my family. To let them down like that? To put my mom through that? ... at that point there’s be two deaths in the family within the same week. All that aside I can feel myself crumbling, I can feel myself starting to blur the lines between thinking about harming myself and planning on harming myself. Everyday it seems to become more of a reality. Closer and closer to death. 

I’m still here. And I plan on staying here. I WANT to live. I WANT to succeed. I WANT happiness. But they seem so far away, so out of touch. Forgotten years ago along with the rest of my child hood. My brain feels scrambled, this life feels scrambled. I just need somebody to reply with a morsel of advice or some encouraging thoughts. I yearn to hear how others feel about these kinds of things. If there’s anybody else who’s thinking the things I am, feel free to reach out.

Don't Know How To Move Forward,"I'm 18 years old, and when I was 13 years old I tried to commit suicide by jumping off my window from my bedroom. Unfourtanely I slide the window open enough and couldn't push myself out the window. I then heard my dad coming up the stairs and had to pretend to go back to sleep to avoid getting caught. You see, I'm a Muslim and in Islam it's forbidden to kill yourself and being a kid back then I wasn't as well learned of the religion as I am today. However after years of emotional abuse and some physical abuse I was sent to a mental hospital with a bunch of other people who were suffering from the same thing as I was. Yet what really made me give up on life was watching my parents come into the room I was in and say to fake being happy and such so that I could come home sooner. They didn't care about the mental state I was in and wanted me to come home so I could bring them less attention as they had to drive across the city to visit me on their daily visits. Part of me doesn't want to kill myself and wants me to go leave my family and get a apartment. However I have lived with my parents my entire life and don't even know how to get a job or pay bills or even buy stuff in stores as I struggle to be near people and will often look away from anyone I see as to draw little attention to myself which never works anyways as people just give me weird looks or laughs.

Okay I'm kinda at a low low point,"So, I care more about animals than anything. Literally nothing I care about more than animals. Seeing animals hurt fucking kills me and so what I've experienced just now tears me apart and now I want to die because I couldn't help the animals.

So, there's someone who is getting a hamster tomorrow and their cage is probs 2 feet wide by a food in length then a few inches at the bottom where they have bedding. If you know about hamsters, this is nowhere near enough room for them. They also have a plastic platform which, without the fact that a hamster can die chewing on it, even with the platform in it the cage is still too small in area. The UK rules is 620sm square UNBROKEN floorspace and that hamster has nowhere near that, I can assure you. This other person has theirs in a three floor cage which can't be more than a foot wide and half a foot in length. And I fucking told them to watch MunchiesPlace on YouTube (she owns a hamster rescue centre so she knows what she is doing) and everything these two people have done is incorrect (plastic platform, plastic ladder, plastic toys, those tube things which are far too small for a large hamster, barely big enough for a dwarf hamster, and so on). 

I tried telling them but they kept telling me to stfu and all calling me names and stuff when I now what I'm doing. Like, I look up EVERYTHING about animals cause I'm autistic blah blah so I know what I'm talking about but they just won't listen because 'their hamster hasn't died yet so it's okay wah wah' and I want to fucking slit my throat.

It doesn't help that I attempted suicide and lived, the exact same day my mum and dad's friend died from cancer so I now feel like I took the life of her because I survived my suicide attempt and, to be honest, I want to kill myself so those two people's hamsters will live and it fucking sucks balls. I think I will attempt tonight because I crave it now. Like, actually crave it, I want nothing more than to slit my throat or my wrists or take all the tablets in my house. I just wanted them to listen but, no, everyone gangs up on me cause apparently I'm annoying and stuff. I just can't with life.

Decision has been made.,"I’m 30 years old, lost my job, about to lose my wife. The only thing stopping me are my friends and sisters. Never had a good relationship with my mom, never knew my dad, and when I finally met him for the first time at 29 he didn’t even want to speak to me.

I’ve been feeling this way since I was 12. I’d have spurts of what I thought was happiness here and there but it always resolves back down to this big gaping hole of nothingness. I’ve felt worthless and life just seems meaningless. I’ve been seriously suicidal (if that’s even a thing) for the past 8 months. Everything I thought that had meaning just doesn’t have meaning anymore.

What’s stopping me again, is my friends. They brought me on a trip for a week to get out the stresses in my life but every moment I’m with them I just get angry at myself for being here. Don’t get me wrong, I’m very appreciative of them and thankful but I just don’t feel anything but wanting to disappear.

this year is weird because i am genuinely alone. i have isolated myself from everyone and am completely self-reliant. it's just an echo-chamber up in here. 

gotten into some bad things, bad substances with horrifying effects. i can remember the things i've seen so vividly that sometimes i'm convinced i'm still there in my goddam delirium cave. scary stuff.

My dog died and life feels purposeless,"I am emotionally drained. My dog gave me a purpose in life, was there for me when I was contemplating suicide, and was a light in my life. His death was shocking and I haven’t been able to properly sleep or eat at night since then. He had seemed fine when I left to go back to college, but just this week he had passed and we found out that he had been suffering from kidney cancer.

I feel horrible. I feel like it’s my fault. I should’ve done something. I should’ve been a better owner to him. I feel so numb. I feel alone. I don’t want to be here anymore.

I felt like I was doing so well for a while mentally. I had finally accepted my grandmother’s death, and I’ve been trying really hard in my studies. Everything seemed to be going perfectly fine. But now that he’s gone I feel empty. Like a part of myself has been taken away from me and I can’t get it back. I’m the only child, and my dog was honestly like a brother to me. So it’s like another family member was taken away from me. A family member that I relied on so much.

I can’t even talk to it with my family because they will think that I’m silly crying over my dog. I feel bad for talking to my friends and boyfriend about it because I don’t want to be a burden. I really could only talk to my dog because I didn’t feel judged by what I was saying. Now that I have lost him I don’t feel like anyone would want to hear the hurt and sadness that I am experiencing.

A guide how you do not survive life as a 20 year old male,"Hello, I'm a regular boy who lives in a regular small town in Sweden. I have spent my life in this town ever since I was born (only moved to another small town for studies). Time has seem to just rush me by the last couple of years. I have always felt like the world isn't ""real"" since I was about 8 years old. During my childhood I could get the most random and intense attacks of anxiety. I remember one day when I was watching television and the show that was on were describing how Earth would be evaporated if a big sized meteor hit our planet. I got so much anxiety of the tought of how easily life could just end. At that age I had an urge to live life to it's fullest and I could not in any way find a reason for someone to take their own life. I loved everything pretty much. I was very interested in fishing so that is how I spent my days back then. Taking my small ATV and drive to different locations and discovering new places to fish. I had a lot of friends in school even if the number of attending kids were low. 

When I was 15 I fell in love with a girl and we were going on and off. I got played really hard. She used me when no one else was around. I was starting to get more and more depressed. I don't blame people that has  been in my life for how I'm feeling. Pretty much everyone has a bad time during the ages between 15-20 because of puberty and a lot of other changes like school and work. For me what happened was that I lost my passion for fly-fishing and sports. I went fishing anyways but playing football and stuff like that was out of the picture. Even though I continued to go on fishing trips but I get so much anxiety when I'm away fishing. I have tried to talk myself into that one day the relaxing and happy feeling I got from fishing will come back but to this day I can say it hasn't returned. 

When I moved to another town for studies I started smoking weed and doing other drugs because that made me feel like I found what I once lost. Today I'm clean but I drink a lot on the weekends. 

I have been working out for the last 3 years with some breaks here and there to keep me in shape and keep staying positive. I try to think that the next day will be better but it never is. 

Anyways I graduated from school and got myself a job at the local sawmill in town. It's ape work, you push some buttons and you lift planks back and forth. It's decent money though and I have been working there for a little more than 2 years now. I can't understand how people can work for their entire life. I just can't. What's the point? I don't want to seem like a lazy ass so I keep going to work and do my business. When I go to bed on the week knowing I will have to go back to work I can't relax. I get so much anxiety and that keeps me awake at night. Which leads to me waking up tired af and going to a place I hate. 

I have never been this depressed and I do not know what to do. I don't really want to do anything besides cooking food, playing videogames and workout. Work really makes it hard to focus on these things when it brings so much anxiety.

I have started going to therapy and I have some medication I eat daily but I have not been able to notice any difference. 

I'm losing hope and my bad mod has been effecting my entire family. I feel like a problem because I'm the only one feeling this way in our family. 

I really want to just be erased. I know commiting suicide will damage my family even more but that is also the only thing keeping me from doing it.",specialEclip,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhhclv/a_guide_how_you_do_not_survive_life_as_a_20_year/,hello regular boy life regular small town sweden spent life town ever since wa born moved another small town study time ha seem rush last couple year always felt like world real since wa 8 year old childhood could get random intense attack anxiety remember one day wa watching television show wa describing earth would evaporated big sized meteor hit planet got much anxiety tought easily life could end age urge live life fullest could way find reason someone take life loved everything pretty much wa interested fishing spent day back taking small atv drive different location discovering new place fish lot friend school even number attending kid low wa 15 fell love girl going got played really hard used one else wa around wa starting get depressed blame people ha life feeling pretty much everyone ha bad time age 15 20 puberty lot change like school work happened wa lost passion fly fishing sport went fishing anyways playing football stuff like wa picture even though continued go fishing trip get much anxiety away fishing tried talk one day relaxing happy feeling got fishing come back day say returned moved another town study started smoking weed drug made feel like found lost today clean drink lot weekend working last 3 year break keep shape keep staying positive try think next day better never anyways graduated school got job local sawmill town ape work push button lift plank back forth decent money though working little 2 year understand people work entire life point want seem like lazy keep going work business go bed week knowing go back work relax get much anxiety keep awake night lead waking tired af going place hate never depressed know really want anything besides cooking food playing videogames workout work really make hard focus thing brings much anxiety started going therapy medication eat daily able notice difference losing hope bad mod ha effecting entire family feel like problem one feeling way family really want erased know commiting suicide damage family even also thing keeping,guide survive life 20 year old male,special e clip,3509,57,special e clip hello regular boy life regular small town sweden spent life town ever since wa born moved another small town study time ha seem rush last couple year always felt like world real since wa 8 year old childhood could get random intense attack anxiety remember one day wa watching television show wa describing earth would evaporated big sized meteor hit planet got much anxiety tought easily life could end age urge live life fullest could way find reason someone take life loved everything pretty much wa interested fishing spent day back taking small atv drive different location discovering new place fish lot friend school even number attending kid low wa 15 fell love girl going got played really hard used one else wa around wa starting get depressed blame people ha life feeling pretty much everyone ha bad time age 15 20 puberty lot change like school work happened wa lost passion fly fishing sport went fishing anyways playing football stuff like wa picture even though continued go fishing trip get much anxiety away fishing tried talk one day relaxing happy feeling got fishing come back day say returned moved another town study started smoking weed drug made feel like found lost today clean drink lot weekend working last 3 year break keep shape keep staying positive try think next day better never anyways graduated school got job local sawmill town ape work push button lift plank back forth decent money though working little 2 year understand people work entire life point want seem like lazy keep going work business go bed week knowing go back work relax get much anxiety keep awake night lead waking tired af going place hate never depressed know really want anything besides cooking food playing videogames workout work really make hard focus thing brings much anxiety started going therapy medication eat daily able notice difference losing hope bad mod ha effecting entire family feel like problem one feeling way family really want erased know commiting suicide damage family even also thing keeping guide survive life 20 year old male
Suicidal me...,"&amp;#x200B;

My whole life, the thought of death was a haunting idea and also in many ways, a relief…

A relief from life itself.

&amp;#x200B;

I would close my eyes and imagine or at least try to imagine nothingness. I would envision my residue of existence (after death) as a tiny dot surrounded by a vacuum of infinite darkness. 

That idea was never really frightening. I was more concerned about the way I would die and the pain I would endure before being delivered from the agony of living. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being younger i was somewhat aware that life would be just that, so i would ask god, the god that i was by some hazardous event born into, to remove me from this existence. I would hope by the age of 14. That didn't happen, therefore i asked again at the age of 17 and that didn't happen either.

Ironically I had matured, or so did I believe. In order to survive my teenage years I had fabricated a version of myself that would be admirable, but only by others. I never truly learned how to like myself due to that inner desire of being liked by others.

I had so many reasons not to. 

I would lie to make friends and then keep on lying and lying again to keep them. That is most exhausting, especially  when you have to keep track of all your lies and make sure you never contradict yourself. 

Some lies were made to protect me from judgement and many others were just because… I could lie.  

That is what gave me hope and not willing to die anymore. Sad, isn't it ? Bare with me, the best is yet to come. 

Then, I had what I most desired, friends,  I was friends with everyone and many wanted to be in my company. I had just become a “cool kid”. A reflection in a mirror casted by a shadow, a shadow without a physical body. An illusion, a fraud.

Putting it like this can seem that i was a victim, but in the end i was never truly that, i hated that idea. I did all I did with plain consciousness and the illusion of not being given a choice. I would tell myself repeatedly; “ lie to others but never to yourself” as it was some sort of inner wisdom or a moral compass that i should abide by.

Ironic, it is to realise that even in lies our brain tries to find something to grasp in order not to realise how deeply rotten we are. 

I spent my last few years drifting without a goal or a purpose, never really understood the concept of that anyway. Life goals, life purpose. 

Things to look forward to I would guess. 

The only thing I would ever look forward to, was dying before getting old. 30 or 35 seemed like a reasonable age.

The question here would not be why would anybody want to die so young but rather how could anybody have goals or a life purpose with such an expectation.

The answer is simple. I was not hoping to build a life nor have a life. 

By now it is easily understandable that everything that would follow would only be self sabotage in order to meet that expectation. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My relationship With god or lack thereof** 

&amp;#x200B;

I never really prayed because I couldn't understand the language. That resulted in a detachment from the principal of praying itself. Mostly I was too lazy to engage in the exercise. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did pray though, as a child, whenever i would be left alone in a dark room by myself or when i wanted something that i believed would only be possible through a miracle. The word miracle for me simply means being granted whatever i truly wanted, and for some reason, i always wanted the most expensive things from my parents to afford. It wasn't  really much, but the circumstances were not favorable financially speaking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would also pray because my parents were very persistent about it. The idea i believe was more significant with a common saying in french :*” l'appétit vient en mangeant”* 

Am not even sure it makes sense to me in  this context but yet somehow it does… at least to their perspective. 

&amp;#x200B;

I believe, am not sure, the idea of a loving god was introduced to me at the age of 14. That came as a shock because I was never presented with that image of god growing up. The message i would receive would only describe him as an omnipotent being that should be feared or else you would be doomed to hellfire for eternity.  

I had and still have so many questions about things in religion that I find incoherent, but back then, I was too afraid to ask, or maybe didn't care enough or didn't know enough to care. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was in fact doomed to that hellfire according to what I was told about the religion and even though by some miracle I managed to access heaven, it was clear to me that I had no interest in the 70 virgin women at my disposal, in one word, pervy, and if anything, everything else in there seemed so boring to me. 

I had to admit to myself that religion was not for me. I could only hope that at some point in life granted by some miracle again, I could find my way to it. 

Miracle, I overuse the word, for me, it means happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

I never described myself as an atheist and neither could i say i was a religious person for sure.

I think the idea of a creator would be a logical explanation for existence and life itself. I also think that humanity as i experienced it, is nothing like that god would be.

Our inerrant selfishness, cowardice and egotistical behaviour that translates in many aspects of religion is simply something that i can't make sense of when it comes to saying something as such : “we were made in god’s image” 

&amp;#x200B;

Selfish, coward, egocentric,.. 

I should know, I was both fluent and expert in the practice of those. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yet, somehow, I ended up being exactly the opposite of the above. Paradoxical.

I could never explain how that came to be. I could say that I finally accepted that I wasn't worthy of happiness. 

I told myself, if i can't experience things in life that could make me happy, i would participate in whichever way in making some other people happy in my stead. 

&amp;#x200B;

That became my religion in some ways. If my life has no meaning and we are all doomed to this misery, we owe it to each other to make our existence more bearable. 

The world is already full of despicable ignorants and self centred people. I would try my best to be one less.

&amp;#x200B;

I am no angel, i am no good, i am inherently bad but i can always try…

Am still not happy and recently started looking into ways to end my life the most effective way and less painful, but there's more to the story.

I’m not really alive for myself,"So I’m a junior in high school, and within the past 12 months i’ve overdosed twice on tylenol. I have moderate social anxiety, but i manage it well enough to make friends. My depression is really the kicker, it’s all genetic as far as i’m concerned and the dissociation keeps me pretty isolated. My life is fine otherwise, decent relationship with parents (we don’t fight but i also don’t tell them anything), good grades, and a promising future if i reached for it.

"Rumors have gotten spread about me at my school, my life is getting progressively worse and I want to die","I'm a female in high school right now, I'd rather not reveal my exact age. This year has been one of the hardest years of my life, and I'm suffering from severe anxiety and depression. A lot of this stems from the fact that I beat myself up if I don't perform perfectly in sports or school.

I'm on antidepressants and I have a therapist but it's not seeming to be helping at all. I've been cutting, considering suicide, and last night I broke into my parents alcohol so that I could just get really drunk for a bit to forget about things. I feel really guilty about that one.

This last summer, I dated this one kid I'll call Jack. He was emotionally abusive and pressured me into doing things I didn't want to do. I broke up with him after about three months because he snitched to my parents everything we had done. I convinced my parents he was lying and that I didn't know him. About 3 months after our breakup he has told 50+ people that we slept together because he wants to be liked and accepted by popular boys at our school. This has caused me to be bullied and made fun of by lots of people because Jack is not well liked. I want him to stop telling people this because it's just making my life so much harder and I don't know how long I can keep this up for.


I can't get my parents involved because they're very strict and would be disappointed and angry for months if they found out I wasn't a virgin. Please give me advice so I can know what to do and how to make this better.",ijustliketorun,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jhgr28/rumors_have_gotten_spread_about_me_at_my_school/,female high school right rather reveal exact age year ha one hardest year life suffering severe anxiety depression lot stem fact beat perform perfectly sport school antidepressant therapist seeming helping cutting considering suicide last night broke parent alcohol could get really drunk bit forget thing feel really guilty one last summer dated one kid call jack wa emotionally abusive pressured thing want broke three month snitched parent everything done convinced parent wa lying know 3 month breakup ha told 50 people slept together want liked accepted popular boy school ha caused bullied made fun lot people jack well liked want stop telling people making life much harder know long keep get parent involved strict would disappointed angry month found virgin please give advice know make better,rumor gotten spread school life getting progressively worse want die,like run,1492,105,like run female high school right rather reveal exact age year ha one hardest year life suffering severe anxiety depression lot stem fact beat perform perfectly sport school antidepressant therapist seeming helping cutting considering suicide last night broke parent alcohol could get really drunk bit forget thing feel really guilty one last summer dated one kid call jack wa emotionally abusive pressured thing want broke three month snitched parent everything done convinced parent wa lying know 3 month breakup ha told 50 people slept together want liked accepted popular boy school ha caused bullied made fun lot people jack well liked want stop telling people making life much harder know long keep get parent involved strict would disappointed angry month found virgin please give advice know make better rumor gotten spread school life getting progressively worse want die

I Wish I Could Kill Myself,"I have thought about this so much throughout my life. I tried to kill myself when I was in the 5th grade. I have hated who I am for as long as I can remember. My mom and I have a very complicated relationship that I think contributed. Thought about suicide daily all throughout middle and high school. Never did it because I am a chicken. Things got better for awhile. I got married at 20 and had 2 kids. I was much happier for a little bit. Now it is like I am right back in the hole. COVID has hit me hard and turned my world upside down. I feel like my life is going nowhere and my only purpose is to stay alive so I don't scar my children. I started making a plan the other day but then stopped when I thought about how sad my 4 year old would be. I think I should do it before my 1 year old is old enough to remember me. But my 4 year old would be devastated. I can't find the energy to do anything other than things for my kids. I went to the doctor and was put on Fluoxetine in April but even just going to pick up my medication every month is too much. I don't want to leave the house if I don't have to. This frustrates my husband a lot so I try for him. But if i had my way i would have no one look at me ever again. Husband is clearly frustrated with dealing with me and I dont blame him. I started crying randomly the other day and instead of being concerned he just looked at me and went ""Really?"" He says he understands and is trying to help me but I can tell he is over it. I feel like I'm fucking up my kids by having them seeing me cry all the time so I think I should just end it so I stop upsetting them. But then if I killed myself my 4 year old wouldnt understand and my husband would be left hanging dry with childcare. Basically I feel like I have to stay alive for everyone but myself. I love my children so much but I feel like a burden to them and like I am going to damage them. At this point I am 25. Been dealing with this for over 15 years and I am so tired.

I wrote my letter. It's all I can give and I couldn't mention one name.," 

To Everyone I Left Behind

I’m writing this on the 23rd of October, 2020. I used to think things would get better. I’ve been hanging on and pressing forward under the assumption that one day I could find some measure of peace. There was always something I was chasing which I felt would change everything if I could just achieve it. First it was escape from abuse. Next I dreamt of friends who value me and a girl to love me. I thought a decent job and a nice place to live would help me steady myself. I’ve always been wrong. Recently I learned it doesn’t matter what I have or who I share it with; I’m miserable regardless. That's the realization that drove me to finally act. Nothing I do, nothing I achieve, and no relationship I foster will ever change the way I feel. Life will always be one brutal struggle after another.

I don’t want anything anymore. I don’t want a loving wife. I don’t want children. I couldn’t care less about travel or sightseeing. There’s nothing else I want out of life. Nothing has stopped me except fear that I’ll hurt those people closest to me. I’ve come to see that, whenever and however I die, the people closest to me will mourn; I’m no longer willing to bear the burden of living for the sake of protecting others from inevitability. 

I wrote this because I want everyone to know why I did it. It’s nobody’s fault, I just don’t want to keep doing this anymore. I’m in pain all the time and this was the only way to end it. I hope you can all come to terms with my decision someday.

My friend wants to kill herself. And I don't know how to help,"First of all my english is not that good so i'll be using google translater. I can't speak about this in russian websites because they're all stupid.  
We became internet friends maybe 5 years ago, since then we are really close. She can tell me whatever she wants and if she will feel better after, i'll be all ears.   
She's 7 years older than me (i'm 23).  she has a difficult life. after the divorce of her parents, the mother began to hate her daughter since childhood. Until now, her mom is very toxic. ""Others may have a good life, but you don't, because it's you. You ruin everything as always"" her mom says that.    
of course my friend thinks so because her closest relative is telling that.   
She doesn't have close friends in real life so it's really hard to feel that you're not alone.   
Many bad things happens in everyone's life. She already have few suicide attempts but at that time she was afraid to make it to the end. Right now she's feeling so bad. She's not afraid anymore. She wants to stop feeling that pain. She has  hallucinations about her ex and bad things that he has done to her. When she thinks about suicide she feels good and free. She thinks that it's an escape for her. And everything will be good without her.  


It will happen in 2 week. And i don't know what to do, what to say to her. What can i say? ""Don't worry. Everything will be okay"". Well it's stupid to say that.

My kids are still asleep this morning and I've been staring at a bottle of medicine since last night.,"My husband and 2 kids went to bed at 9PM last night. I did not. 

I've sat here on the couch and stared at this large bottle of acetaminophen since 9:30pm last night. I poured some out. I counted 45 pills. I put them back. I did this over and over and lost track of time and now I've been sitting here for 13 hours counting and recounting pills and each time I count them I count a reason to take each one. 

Im a failure. I cant do anything right. I cant even get out bed in the morning and I just lie there and when night comes I cant sleep because I dont want the disappointment of waking up in this nightmare. I dont do housework anymore and the mess piles up. I dont shower, brush my hair, brush my teeth, or do anything outside of playing and taking care of babies. I have no one outside my husband and two toddlers and my husband doesnt understand depression and thinks it's something that just comes and leaves just as quickly. I pretend to be okay but he's sleeping at 9PM and I'm awake till sunrise counting pills and reasons to take them. 

I just want to be normal. I just want to wake up happy. I want to be motivated to clean. I want to feel alive and awake. 

My life feels like a nightmare and I dont why. I feel anxious and shaken and like I'm in a nightmare. The people around feel like pawns and fakes and like they're ghost and not even there, even my own husband and kids. None of this feels real and I'm in a nightmare but the only way to wake up from a nightmare is to die in the nightmare and I dont know if I want to die for real but I know I just wanna wake up and be normal.

Do not disturb. Do not resuscitate.,"I feel so small and so insignificant. 
Non existent. An afterthought.
People don't care. Not really anyway, faux caring is simply an escape, a way to make themselves feel better.

Im hurting so so much and there's never anyone there for me. No family. Socially awkward friends who, let's face it are so happy and enthralled in their new life simply saying anything more than 'i work so much, im just tired' would be burdening them. And that's all I am, I burden to others. Im truly happy for them but also a little envious.

I hate feeling this way but honestly it's been so long since I really felt any other way its become the norm. 
Put on the mask everyday, let people believe im simply a workaholic and perpetually tired. 

As I lay here in bed, trying not to cry because my tears sting my eyes, the hounds wedging me between them in an act of comfort, all I can think of is what I've lost, a pity party if you will, how I sadly wake up everyday perpetually exhausted. Im not missed now, simply forgotten, pushed to the side, an after thought, always an afterthought.

I've been slowly setting my socials up, so that I can just slip away unnoticed, im nearly perfectly invisible that people forget I exist. No tags, no pictures, a lack of posts, a permanently inactive status...noone will notice. If I could slip into nothingness right now I would.

It came to my attention earlier this evening that I could ruin my body art and not a single soul would notice for days, maybe even weeks. And with no family to contact, no emergency contacts anywhere, it would be as if I never existed, cremated and tossed in trash when eventually my neighbours were alerted by the unpleasant odour wafting from my unit. I go days without talking to people, 'the art of solitude' I suppose, a few would believe im tired and sleeping or ticked off and need space...how ignorant.

"No clue what to do at this point, feel like I've tried everything possible.","I'm not sure what to do anymore, or if there is anything else I could possibly do. I'm 22 years old and have been dealing with mental health issues since school, I think the only reason I've managed to last this long is genuinely because of my mother who unfortunately died in June. I've tried working jobs with very little to no success as I keep having issues with mental health and having extreme episodes where I can't think or do anything. Ever since school I've seen doctors about it and since about 14 was put down to anxiety, within the last couple of years I was told I could have a form of autism, I've been told by others possible bipolar or possible BPD.  


To this day I've never no matter how hard I've rang and cried and pleaded on the phone got the help I need and nearly every mental health person I've seen has just basically dismissed me after I've missed a phone appointment or something, something that is because of the ongoing problems I'm having. Then because of that they say that I am better and no longer need the help and it's another waiting list just for them to tell me I can only help myself and that I need to go out and socialise. Sometimes I spend all my time out with ""friends"", sometimes all my time at home crying wanting to just die, I've attempted a couple of times in the past.  


It's impossible for me to live like this, I spend more than half the month with no money because I end up having a suicidal episode where I end up self destructive and I end up with nothing. Every month since at least June I've spent 2 weeks out of every month not eating. I live with my brother who at times has seemed like he wants to help and understands but then everything is used against me a week after and I'm guilt tripped for cutting myself, not having a job, using even the slightest thing like some bread when I've been desperate feeling ill.  


I've now got 3 weeks with no money or food to go, in a household I'm not welcome, wanting to just die constantly but feeling selfish and everything for it, not wanting someone to find my body, not wanting to leave stuff unsaid, so I sit in a panic state constantly with no friends or family to help at all.  


I know people say it's never worth it but it's the least selfish thing I could ever do, it frees the burden of me on everyone, I know I don't bring anything to the table just problems and issues and even though I want to want to live, I just don't and life feels impossible to me, I've tried to prove myself wrong too and others but I can't.

"In 30s and still loner, socially awkward, reject - why not kill myself?","I'm in my 30s and alot of people my age are married with children, busy with work, already have their clique of friends, so it's very hard to make new friends at my age.

I went through a lot of verbal and emotional bullying in school and it continued in college and office jobs in adulthood. It seems like most other geeks/nerds at least had other geeks/nerds as friends when growing up. But I didn't even have them as friends. People have said in condescending ways that I don't talk, I look lonely, I just ""study all the time"", I've never had a girlfriend, I'm short, etc. I've had to deal with so much bitterness and PTSD flashbacks for pretty much my whole life since middle school. 

Not just about the past bullying but how it has affected my life right now. That is, I now have social anxiety, and people have absolutely *no* empathy for shy people and victim-blame them for being weak. I can't just ""get over it"" because even when I consistently try to make friends, be confident and outgoing by attending meetups, many of the people there are cliquish and unwelcoming towards shy, low-status males. So many times people ignore what I say, talk over me and interrupt me, treat me like a 3rd wheel, talk to others instead of me, if left alone with me then make up an excuse to leave me, etc. For the ones who are friendly and actually listen, alot of them don't show up to following meetups

What's so frustrating is that I feel I'm way more proactive than most people yet I have nothing to show for it. Not just in regards to how I always have to go to meetups and go alone whereas most people already have friends and don't need to go to meetups. But also in how I have to strike up conversations with people whereas people who already have friends and cliques can get away with making no effort in socializing with new people with lesser status than them. 

For example, one common advice is ""ask people questions"" and ""people love talking about themselves"". I've asked many people many questions about themselves and shown interest in them, only for them to either show disinterest and give blunt replies, or talk at length about themselves, while not asking me *any* questions and showing *no* interest in me

Another example of my proactiveness is that I've spent nearly a year on weightlifting and BJJ, yet I don't really feel any more confident, less shy, and or have less PTSD flashbacks than before. I also tried meditation many times and hardly noticed any improvement. I've also attended plenty of Toastmasters meetings and given numerous speeches yet noticed no improvement in my life

I have traveled to nearly 10 countries and spent a few months living in some of them. Most were friendly and some were rude towards me, possibly judging me as a ""loser back home"" who came there to escape my problems back home. 

Another common piece of advice from society for introverts is to play sports as you can have fun without talking as much. But I often am not taken seriously, get picked dead-last, many times have to deal with rude immature pricks trying to shove me and such, rude teammates being cliquish and showing obvious favoritism towards their friends or guys taller than me, etc. I'm in ok shape as I'm around 5'6 and 145 lbs

Another common piece of advice from society regarding getting dates is ""it's a numbers game"", ""you got nothing to lose by asking her out"". I've *literally* cold-approached over 2000 women at nightclubs/shopping malls/coffee shops/etc and didn't get *even one* girlfriend/lay from it. I got around 10 girls willing to go on dates with me (none of them wanted a 2nd date), and maybe one would've been interested in a hookup at a nightclub, but another guy took her from me and I didn't see her again. 

What angers me is that so many guys can easily get girlfriends despite having never cold-approached a woman as they always get introduced to them because they have status/social circle, or they use dating apps with photos demonstrating their status/social circle. I had no choice but to cold-approach because I've been a reject/outcast/loner my whole life

I've also seen numerous therapists and none of them really helped. Sure, they listened and showed some empathy but didn't really offer any solutions. 

Since I'm socially screwed, I can at least do well with my career and financially, right? Not so much. I have a high net worth and income for my age, but it's chump change compared to other software engineers my age. As angry as I am about being very underpaid, I'm finding it nearly impossible to get a new higher-paying job because of all the competition, I often feel so unmotivated and depressed that I lack the energy to study for coding interviews, etc. Some of them make 3-5x what I make as they had friends refer them for jobs, they didn't have employment gaps like I did from workplace bullying, they can concentrate when preparing for interviews as they don't have depression/PTSD like me, etc. 

Why are people so cruel/judgemental/condescending towards low-status males who can't join cliques? Is it because they have no empathy for they have to go through because they themselves never had to experience being excluded, ignored, bullied, etc? Or is because of ""hurt people hurt people""? They're hurt themselves so instead of helping social rejects, they want to project their hurt onto them?

What the hell else am I supposed to do? Why shouldn't I kill myself?",thraway14,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jh2yjw/in_30s_and_still_loner_socially_awkward_reject/,30 alot people age married child busy work already

I somewhat made a suicide attempt.. not sure what I should do from here and could use some support and advice,"Hi everyone.. I’ll try to make it brief, but last night I was intoxicated and I locked myself in my office with a bottle of Xanax and some sentimental items and photos, and after some thinking, I decided to go ahead and take the Xanax. I took enough of it to know I might stop breathing. I wrote a suicide letter too. Brought all my sentimental items to my bed with me and went to sleep. 
I’m here this morning pretty upset with myself and realizing that maybe it wasn’t a suicide attempt, but it was definitely a gamble? Maybe it doesn’t matter. I wrote the letter. 
I don’t know what to do now.

Can i talk to someone please?,"15m.

Last night i was really depressed. I felt like i wanted to just take alot of my meds and just hope for the worst and not wake up. I didn’t do that but i cried alot. This morning i woke up and overheard one of my sisters saying that my grandad has cancer. 

I can’t do this anymore. It just keep on getting worse. 

I’m emotionally sensative because of my mental health. Moderate to severe ADHD, Severe anxiety and depression. I’m sorry if i fuck up if i try to talk to you. I’m not good at it.

I Want to kill Myself,"I am a 20 year old adult from India. I clearly don't find any purpose of my life. I come from very poor family, since the childhood I grew up with the lack of money. I never had enough money to live a decent life, I always thought of killing myself since last 3 years. I was very good at studies till high school after completing my high school, I got admission in a college after clearing toughest exam in India. After joining college I was very happy as it was my dream college but it didn't come of that way. I started hating my college, my course, my life and everything and tried to kill myself twice. I often used to go to bed thinking about how I might kill myself. I failed at killing myself and I began to search  for money because I thought that money will bring me happiness, and tbh for a short time it did. I became happy I started earning for 5-6 months. I earned for about $5000 I forgot about depression and everything and found purpose in my life and I felt the way that I never felt before, but on a very gloomy evening, I lost around $4500 dollars. I almost lost everything and I lost my all source of income. From that day only I am again struggling to find a purpose in my life, I am not able to focus on my studies, I can not sleep properly, I can not eat. I just want to kill myself and leave this earth.

Non-depression induced suicide thoughts,"I don't have mental problems, or at least haven't discovered yet, but I often feel sad, calmly sad. I have bad temper, this pisses off my family I'm always in cold War with them. I'm not good at, r interested in sustaining friendship, I don't put in the effort but I'm bold of having the desire of being cared by others. 

I don't consider myself as a failure, or at least not yet. I do well academically and now live on scholarship in another country away from all my family and friends, if they exist. I'm tired of all sorts pod things I need to care about, especially when the ongoing examinations are putting more stress and anxiety on me. What's the point of striving for 'future'? To get a decent job while continue to drain myself in office cells? And hopefully retire, enjoy some leisure years before the inevitable death? 

Some say that the meaning of living is the enjoy it, but I'm not enjoying it, i choose to not enjoy it right now so that I can enjoy it 'in the future', but clearly there will be little to be desired in the future as I perceive. I have used to view the world in a rather pessimistic and fatalistic way, this won't change regardless my situation. So why I keep being alive and enduring the suffering? If I swiftly or impulsively decide to kill myself at one moment, things are all over for me, im emancipated, i would finally be able to enjoy the eternal composure for ever. I don't understand why I keep sticking myself to all the trivial affairs, maybe I'm afraid of death not because it is terrible, it will be our destiny, we all end up being star dust, embrace the fate in advance sounds not crazy at all. I probably fear about the irreversibility of this decision, and it leads to unknown. 

I don't have much to miss if I die, literally no one cares about me and I have isolated myself since the quarantine started, and stopped contacting my very few acquaintances.

"Good news, i guess.","I was going to commit suicide with my father's gun at the end of the year. Don't get me wrong, it was a good year for me. I got to enjoy games with my friends, even if in voice call. I just couldn't fake it anymore, i had to do it.

I'm too much of a coward to try painful suicide methods, like hanging, jumping, drowing, cutting, and i don't know how to take pills, literally, every medication that i take i have to dismantle the pill to take it.

So the gun was my last option. I already had some things prepared, such as suicide notes. But then... My father accidentally messed it up.

He has anger issues. One day, he started to fight with his neighbor and shot his car. (i'm pretty sure he controlled himself so he wouldn't kill the guy instead)

Now he doesn't have his gun anymore. I like to think it was destiny saying ""Hey. You have some things that you should resolve first.""",ltwezz,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgoxk7/good_news_i_guess/,wa going commit suicide father gun end year get wrong wa good year got enjoy game friend even voice call fake anymore much coward try painful suicide method like hanging jumping drowing cutting know take pill literally every medication take dismantle pill take gun wa last option already thing prepared suicide note father accidentally messed ha anger issue one day started fight neighbor shot car pretty sure controlled kill guy instead gun anymore like think wa destiny saying hey thing resolve first,good news guess,lt zz,885,19,lt zz wa going commit suicide father gun end year get wrong wa good year got enjoy game friend even voice call fake anymore much coward try painful suicide method like hanging jumping drowing cutting know take pill literally every medication take dismantle pill take gun wa last option already thing prepared suicide note father accidentally messed ha anger issue one day started fight neighbor shot car pretty sure controlled kill guy instead gun anymore like think wa destiny saying hey thing resolve first good news guess
Had my first car crash today... (16F),"The last couple of days have been really screwed up for me, from failing a test I took days to study for and getting my first B to this today (amongst other things). I’m sorry to anyone reading this, I know this sounds trivial and other people have real issues on this sub, but I didn’t know where else to put this. I’ve been feeling extremely stupid for the last couple of hours because the crash was completely avoidable. A car drifted into my lane while I was driving with my mom and I panicked (I have bad anxiety) and swerved to prevent an accident and crashed into some trees. The other driver kept going with no damage. I feel incredibly dumb and embarrassed, I wasted the police and emt’s time (I wasn’t injured, although I feel like I deserve to be), and I could’ve hurt my mom. My parents aren’t mad at me and know it was an accident, but the repairs are gonna be expensive, I just know it. I didn’t want to become another teenage driving statistic where reckless teenagers crash their cars for no reason, so I always tried my best to drive as safe as possible, but now I am. There are a lot of days where I wake up and and the first I do is ask why. I hate myself even more now, my life has no value. I’m a terrible example for my younger cousin who is just learning to drive, and I honestly feel traumatized. Nonetheless, this is all my fault and I’m not asking for any sympathy, I don’t deserve any. My mom and dad say I should take a bath and rest and to not to worry about it, but I don’t deserve it. I feel so sick right now, worse than earlier, and I’m extremely tired, but I can’t go back to sleep. l don’t want to feel this anymore, I just want to be done, but I’d just get found and I don’t want to create another unnecessary bill. Thank you to anyone who bothered to read this, I appreciate it.

Edit: Thanks everyone, so much. I still feel bad, but I was able to fall asleep and the urge isn’t as strong anymore. I’ve struggled with depression for six years and in all of those years I’ve never felt as comforted as I do now, thank you.",LateCarrot7356,10,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jh2m8b/had_my_first_car_crash_today_16f/,last couple day really screwed failing test took day study getting first b today amongst thing sorry anyone reading know sound trivial people real issue sub know else put feeling extremely stupid last couple hour crash wa completely avoidable car drifted lane wa driving mom panicked bad anxiety swerved prevent accident crashed tree driver kept going damage feel incredibly dumb embarrassed wasted police emt time injured although feel like deserve could hurt mom parent mad know wa accident repair gonna expensive know want become another teenage driving statistic reckless teenager crash car reason always tried best drive safe possible lot day wake first ask hate even life ha value terrible example younger cousin learning drive honestly feel traumatized nonetheless fault asking sympathy deserve mom dad say take bath rest worry deserve feel sick right worse earlier extremely tired go back sleep l want feel anymore want done get found want create another unnecessary bill thank anyone bothered read appreciate edit thanks everyone much still feel bad wa able fall asleep urge strong anymore struggled depression six year year never felt comforted thank,first car crash today 16f,late carrot 7356,2058,37,late carrot 7356 last couple day really screwed failing test took day study getting first b today amongst thing sorry anyone reading know sound trivial people real issue sub know else put feeling extremely stupid last couple hour crash wa completely avoidable car drifted lane wa driving mom panicked bad anxiety swerved prevent accident crashed tree driver kept going damage feel incredibly dumb embarrassed wasted police emt time injured although feel like deserve could hurt mom parent mad know wa accident repair gonna expensive know want become another teenage driving statistic reckless teenager crash car reason always tried best drive safe possible lot day wake first ask hate even life ha value terrible example younger cousin learning drive honestly feel traumatized nonetheless fault asking sympathy deserve mom dad say take bath rest worry deserve feel sick right worse earlier extremely tired go back sleep l want feel anymore want done get found want create another unnecessary bill thank anyone bothered read appreciate edit thanks everyone much still feel bad wa able fall asleep urge strong anymore struggled depression six year year never felt comforted thank first car crash today 16f

I’ll take misery over nothing,"
I feel nothing at all.

For some reason I often, if not always, find myself wanting to be back in that darkness that my depression used to be. Before meds, before getting in a relationship. By all means I’m better than before but I wish I wasn’t, as awful and probably insensitive as that is to say. I feel guilty for wanting to go back to the nonstop thoughts about planning my suicide and self hateful thinking. 

If I knew getting better meant being stuck feeling nothing 24/7 I wouldn’t have bothered with therapy or medication. I preferred the misery over whatever this is. The only thing that remains from how I felt before is the fatigue. Mix that with apathy and what results is me lying in place, too tired to do anything and thinking about nothing at all.

I want my misery back. I want off this medication. I want to have the drive to kill myself again. I want to die but I never will end it myself in the state I’m in right now. I need the misery as the motivator, I need my old hopelessness and self hate to tell me what I really am, which is worthless and a burden to everyone.

What are you meant to do if you've found yourself actively planning for suicide?,"I watched that new contra video where she talked about the difference between active suicidal thoughts and suicidal ideation. And how suicidal ideation is this passive sort of murmuring in your brain, rather than an active and dangerous plan.

But say you do have a date in mind, and a method. And you've researched this method and it's actually pretty full-proof. And you haven't wavered. You don't see any hope in your life, and you spend most days imagining how great non-existence will be, pierced by the occasional guilt at knowing it will hurt your loved one. But nonetheless you are seriously on course to end your life.

What are you meant to do? I've called hotlines. They can be helpful to release pent up emotion, but there's no answers there. GP's hate me and act like I'm wasting their time (which tbh I guess I am!) I don't have many friends, but I have a few. Am I meant to tell them? Am I meant to just not do it?

Time's up,"Years ago I would always overexaggerate my mental breakdowns telling myself that I had went insane from depression; I now suffer from actual psychosis and I can't seem to escape the endless delusions and thoughts that are swirling around inside my head, I'm literally insane.

I can't focus on a traditional lifestyle because everything outside the bigger picture is trivial to me, I could not care less for anything that life throws at me. I may be insane but I'm smart enough to acknowledge the fact that I lack the necessary prospects that would lead to a life of contentment. My delusions does not stem from an inconsistent perspective on life as I can see reality for what it is, I'm just fundamentally incapable of finding contentment in it.

I care only for knowing the cosmic truth, but I may never fully know and comprehend it in life, which is why I can never be content. I cannot fathom living an ignorant and vain existence never knowing why I even did it in the first place and still somehow be content. This is where my delusions start to wander, in moments where I fall into a meditative state of deep introspection and contemplation I have spurts of clarity and enlightenment where I can feel an incomprehensive truth, I know it through intuition, but I can never see or fathom it. The theme seems to be unity, a collective and unending force, fiction and reality becomes undistinguishable as everything is derivative of infinity which allows for everything and all to be part of reality.

I know there is more to life than going to college but I can't go through this life being stuck here with anxiety and issues that ruins even things like my part-time job,"I graduated high school 2 years ago. I had mental health issues so I halted my plans for university. 

The first year was real bad - I was having anxiety, breaking down and crying about why I was a valedictorian but kept getting rejected everywhere I go. I just couldn't stomach confidence and doing anything any more. To me, there was no point to my life and the sacrifices  I made during school (setting aside my understanding friends, lack of fun, making time for studies, making time for my ECs to the point I hated it, family problems, boyfriend who ended up cheating on me, mentor who unfortunately passed away, general anxiety worsening with each social interaction that went south and crying to bed remembering how painful it is to then get up acting everything is okay like I always do)

Took a long break from anything productive at the advice of friends. I felt like such a waste of space to my family. I know they want to give me time but I could tell they just want me to move on with life but I don't want to move on if it means settling on anything that will accept me. I spent time searching and I finally found what I wanted to do through some opportunities. I took the plunge and got a scholarship ride to a college I was excited to go into.

Second year was when the pandemic struck. I lost my scholarship. I withdrew from my dream college. Both my grandparents are in hospital. My anxiety is spiralling out of control at part-time work and internships just falling apart. I dont know where to go but I know what I want to do. And yet, I dont know if I will get it.

I feel stuck here in my home country. I really want to go study, do research and just finally be done with this crap about my anxiety, family situation but I keep coming back because I know I cant leave due to the pandemic and just... I know my parents and relatives cant take care of my grandparents by themselves.

Please I dont know what to do. Do I have to give up everything for others and things that wont work out?

I hope I'll get to die over the next few months.,"I'm at a point where I want to die but don't want to kill myself. The reason why I don't want to do it myself is twofold: first, it'd hurt my family. Second, I might fail and permanently injure myself. I want someone or something else to kill me.

Looking at the current events, however, I think I might get a chance to die in the near future. Though my age makes me unlikely to die from COVID, I think a second American civil war is becoming increasingly likely given the current political situation in the US. It'll not only give me a chance to die, but I'll get to do so while serving my country. I just hope I'll be killed as painlessly as possible with as few other people dying as possible and that I won't go to hell.

Tried to kill myself last night. No matter how much i try to stay positive i doubt i will ever be happy.,"Warning: (mentions of sexual abuse)I have had suicidal thoughts for as long as i remember. When i was 4 i even remember telling my cousin that i was going to kill myself. After that life didn't get much better. Well if i were to go into a long paragraph about my life story and every reason i have to want to die that will be a long story, for now im going to be talking about the reason this time (yes i tried to kill myself multiple times woops.) The thing is i have never had a good year. I have had moments but over all their is allways some problem or some random mood swing that leaves me wanting to die for atleast half of the year. I dont strive to be happy really i just strive to be ok for once. I dont want to feel pain anymore. I just feel hopeless. I have diagnosed depression so sometimes even when things are going ok i am still stuck with constant pain. When i was in 3rd grade i was molested by a girl in my school. She was the same age as me. The first time it happened she told me if i told my parents they would kill me because it is wrong to be gay. So i didn't know what she was doing and i didn't even know how sex worked at all so i was just very confused. Because of that combined with other bullying i started to pull my hair out untill i was bald due to stress which made me feel unattractive and stripped me of my self confidence completely. I really didn't like it when she assaulted me but i couldn't say no because i thought what she was doing was normal for friends. I even encouraged it sometimes because she was really mean to me but she was my only friend so when she would do those things it was the only time she would show me affection. I never told anybody untill 6th grade when i was finally able to break free from her. I was still pretty clueless about the weight of what she did to me so i told a friend of mine and her being a 6th grader took it lightly and told the whole school and they proceeded to call me a lesbian, slut, ect...  My dad found out because he overheard me talking to my friend about it. He was very supportive but i still felt guilty because i still felt like maybe i was lying about being raped and it was really my fault. I only really said no directly maybe 2 out of many times and i even encouraged it sometimes because i thought that maybe she would be nice to me for once so maybe i was just a discusting whore. When i told my mom she laughed and jokingly asked if that makes me gay now and told me that its bad because that makes me impure and not a virgin anymore. She also scolded me for not being able to push her away. Fast forward to age 15. I finally understand my trauma, i understand the weight of it and seem to have gotten over it. I know its not my fault and am more self aware and emotionally intellegant. I am not the child i used to be. Well not exactly...So i got a boyfriend that i love very much. We are sexually active and he knows about my trauma because i told him. He told me that he wants to hang out more outside rather then have sex at the house and for some reason that just triggered me. I just felt like i was the only one horny one and i was just disgusting and i randomly just felt extremely embarrassed and ashamed. Not only that but during sex he likes to call me a slut and pretend he doesn't want me sometimes (he has a power struggle kink i do it back too) and it sort of makes me feel a little uncomfortable but im into it too a little dispite that and i just tried to push those thoughts away because i want to show that i am strong enough to handle it and i still want sex to be fun for him. So i tried to find a solution. I no longer wanted to feel rejected so i was like ok im going to be flirty untill he gives in and initiates and i feel ok again. Well... He had an anxiety attack because he told me i was acting strange, and i felt horrible like i was just being petty when he is going through something worse and i should support him instead of get passive aggressive. So i told him about my issue and everything seemed ok and we talked it out untill he went to sleep. After that i just felt completely suicidal. I cant talk to him about my trauma or how much i want to die i can only bring up a small portion because i don't want to burden him. I just then started to feel hopeless like my trauma will allways pop its head in and i cant escape. Then just a ton of flashbacks happened and i felt like i didn't want him to touch me anymore i just really feel disgusted with myself. At the heat of the moment i got out a necktie and made a noose and tied it to the ceiling fan and just tried to kill myself. I ended up makeing it too long so i just stood their anxious and shaking while i was trying to push myself down. And i stoped once my face got purple and the ringing in my ears got so loud it terrified me. After that i just cleaned up and looked at the mark on my neck.

I welcome death with open arms and probably open wrists. I can’t see an end to the suffering except through my own demise. I’m broken.

My death will bring long-term relief to everyone who has had the misfortune of meeting me.,"I have been thinking lately, how I have become a significant nuisance in the lives of the people I love and care about. I just keep being a bother that gnaws on their well-being, slowly making their lives worse. Especially for my family and my mother. She didn't deserve to have more shit to deal with, being virtually bedridden is more than enough. 

And yet she has to put up with me being an useless slacker that can't even get his own shit figured out, that can barely keep up with basic things as keeping the house organized. Despite the fact that not doing that just causes her more pain and suffering. I still can get myself together to do that. It's almost like I don't care about her, like some sort of heartless monster.

Nevermind the fact that I am virtually a leech, a parasite consuming whatever my family has to sustain itself without giving them anything back. Not even am I able to fulfill my role of student, doing the major I have always dreamed of. Turns out it's just a dream, as I have proven myself to be quite unable to do fucking anything.

The worst thing is that I am occupying a slot someone else who would be much more capable of taking advantage of. Someone who actually has earned being where I am. Someone who deserves it. But that's not me. Never has been, it is clear. Because I just am not good for anything.

Too dumb, too harmful, too detrimental, good for nothing. Perhaps I am exactly that. Maybe I always have been a monster in the making, slowly wrecking havoc in the lives of anyone remotely related to me, but it just has become apparent to me now. Did I just get the self-awareness I have always needed? Who knows.

Whatever the case might be, the point is that now I am painfully aware of the consequences of my existence. It stands to reason, then, that my existence *has* to end if I will stop being such a detriment to everyone else.

As I don't have the option to OD or hang myself and slitting my wrists or any vital vein or artery is bound to fail and also be traumatizing for whoever stumbles upon such an image, I have been considering to run away with no devices on me at all, no ID, nothing.

Just leave the house with the most raggedy clothes I have and leave everything else behind. Then I can find a place I can just bury myself in, so no one ends up stumbling upon a rotting corpse. And then I'll leave nature to do the rest. It's painful, but that is exactly another reason to do it; a being like me who just creates pain and misery deserves to get it all back, no? What better way to do than by starving myself to death?

Or perhaps I could just throw myself into a river, there's plenty of large ones around. The body is bound to just sink if I get myself sufficiently far from any person who might see that. Drowning sounds like another painful way to go, so to the list it goes. 

Plus, the good thing about just disappearing is that people will not blame themselves if I kill myself, they won't be tormenting themselves with doubts and what ifs. If I disappear people might be worried for a while, but then they will move on. Life will go on and they will get to reap the fruits of a life without me; a better life.

But of course, it's all a pipe dream for now. I will have to wait until I can somehow manage to leave every behind, and properly prepare to that moment. But I already have an idea of what I'll be doing.

A serious question,"I am 23 years old. All my life I have been introverted (which I didn't use to mind) and unpopular (which I have always minded).

Every day I wish I could either go back to the past and fix my mistakes or wake up as somebody else.

I may be autistic to some degree, and as a child I had such a terrible time socializing that my parents moved me to a different school because I was tremendously isolated all the time. In the following school things were equally terrible, and to add to that my grades became awful as well.

Also, I never played sports nor did extra activities, which made me uninteresting and weak. I was awfully unpopular and everyone picked on me.

I was always more childish than my peers. When kids started flirting and doing ""grown-up things"" like drinking and smoking, I did none of that. When they started dating and going to parties, I wasn't part of that either.

When I entered college, I had no interest in the major I had entered and I quit after only one year. I was so ashamed of my bad reputation, my bad grades and my bad physique that I didn't socialize at all and I made no friends at all. While other people partied and dated, I did none of that.

I became self-secluded and I missed on all the developmental milestones that other people achieved. Drinking with friends, going to a disco, dating, having sex, attending parties at someone's house. I did NONE of that.

So, the question:

**Is it worth it to stay alive at this point?**

I have already attempted suicide and failed. I hate my life, I hate what I have lived. I would trade it all for a different life right now.

I tried therapy and also medication, but both of those things seriously aren't helping me at all. They do nothing.

I missed out on everything and ""catching up"" at 23 seems pointless to me. Doing NOW what I didn't do at 16-18 feels to me like a sad rendition of something I should have done when it was the time.

Posting my list of reasons to live so that I can’t deny them anymore,"If I died:
I’d never get to travel the world. 
I’d never kiss my boyfriend. 
I’d never wake up to my dog licking my face. 
I’d never see my little brother graduate. 
I’d never get to marry someone. 
I’d never feel the sensation of sliding freshly shaved legs under the sheets. 
I’d never get to prove my mom wrong. 
I’d never get to hear my favorite artists new songs. 

My dog would never know what happened to me. 
My mom would relapse. 
My brother would take his life too. 
My fake friends would post about how great of friends we were. 
My boyfriend would blame himself. 
My grandparents would go through my stuff. 
My teachers would turn it into some extra “suicide prevention” lesson for everyone else.

I feel like I’m yelling into an empty void,"I really don’t know how to drag out saying I want to die. I really just want to die. I hate life, and every monotonous, depressing, heartbreaking thing about it. 

My family doesn’t give a shit about my depression, I’ve told my mom how I feel, and she said I was just selfish and that everyone feels that way, that I’m just being a crybaby.

I had to play it off as a joke to my dad because he said he was gonna send me to a mental asylum.

I don’t know who to talk to, in fact, I’m afraid to post this here because if my friends or family find it, then I’m gonna be sent to a fucking asylum and locked up.

My parents don’t take it seriously, my family doesn’t care, my friends are probably sick of me saying depressing things and don’t offer much help apart from a “that sucks man” and I don’t blame them. I don’t want them to have to constantly reassure me, they have their own life and it’s not up to them to be my constant reassurance.

I’ve talked to dozens of therapists and councillors, talked to help lines. But they all give the same advice, say the same things, whenever I talk to one of them it feels like I’m being talked to by a goddman audio loop.

There’s none I can talk to, no one who can fix me. You can’t fix me.

Parents will talk to you and say they know best, that you’re overreacting, because they were teens too at one point. But society has changed so much that they will never, and can never understand.

I don’t know what to do. I can’t get a gun where I live, I don’t have the willpower to cut my wrists or hang myself. It’ll hurt. I don’t want to have to try to kill myself and then get some life altering disability or something from it.

I know life isn’t fair and everything but why couldn’t it at least give us a way out of it?? It’s fucking bullshit. I didn’t choose to be born, I don’t want to live, so why in the fuck can’t I just die without having to feel a fuck ton of pain?!

Sometimes I want to be tortured.,"edit: probably NSFW. probably not safe for anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes I wish I was kidnapped, imprisoned, and mercilessly tortured.

Wouldnt have to think about anything. Wouldnt be a failure, a social outcast, or an emotional burden.

Just raw pain as someone tortures me ever more cruelly. My entire being wrapped up in pain and just trying to survive another 30 seconds.

Until I give in to the pain. Give up and accept it as the only friend I have. Beg for more. Relish in the sweet agony of being held an inch above death without ever being able to reach it.

I would beg for more. Maybe I would be trained to hurt myself. I would devise my own punishments. Air them for the world to see. How much can a sack of meat take? What would its reaction be to certain things? Would I scream? Convulse? Rip my hair out and try to strangle myself with it? Would I bash my head against the wall until passing out and then awaken to a red hot iron burning my feet? Would I then be forced to walk on glass?

How long could I smile under such circumstances? What would it take to convince me to chop off my own hand and beg to be allowed to eat it?

Would I even be allowed to speak or would my tongue be cut out and skewered?  Maybe sleep deprivation would be the worst. Not allowed to lie down, sit, or crouch. Would you play darts with my face? Would you smash my fingers with a hammer? Would you make me sit still without moving for weeks and make me beg to flex a single muscle?

I promise I would listen and do as you say. My mind and my soul are gone. I am nothing. I am your plaything designed to exact your revenge. Think of me as your worst enemy, the worst thing that has ever lived. Why can't you tear me down, tear me apart, tear me from this world and force me to live as a wretched and miserable piece of garbage?

I want to beg for the end. But never quite get there. A month, a year, a decade. Into old age. My mind twisted, stunted, and no longer human. My nerve endings scarred from the pain and my pain aversion sense dismantled. Please one more blow. One more agonizing punishment. One more day of hell before I go. And you never let me go. I dont want to go but you never let me go. And i am so happy. So happy to finally become who i was always meant to be. And i sit in pure bliss at the dismantling of my personhood, and suddenly, without expecting it, drift off into eternal slumber. The last echoes of pain echoing eternally between my fried neurons who interpret it as joy and salvation, and i enter the heaven I was fooled to believe in.",lonelyperson789,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jh3wm4/sometimes_i_want_to_be_tortured/,edit probably nsfw probably safe anyone amp x200b sometimes wish wa kidnapped imprisoned mercilessly tortured wouldnt think anything wouldnt failure social outcast emotional burden raw pain someone torture ever cruelly entire wrapped pain trying survive another 30 second give pain give accept friend beg relish sweet agony held inch death without ever able reach would beg maybe would trained hurt would devise punishment air world see much sack meat take would reaction certain thing would scream convulse rip hair try strangle would bash head wall passing awaken red hot iron burning foot would forced walk glass long could smile circumstance would take convince chop hand beg allowed eat would even allowed speak would tongue cut skewered maybe sleep deprivation would worst allowed lie sit crouch would play dart face would smash finger hammer would make sit still without moving week make beg flex single muscle promise would listen say mind soul gone nothing plaything designed exact revenge think worst enemy worst thing ha ever lived tear tear apart tear world force live wretched miserable piece garbage want beg end never quite get month year decade old age mind twisted stunted longer human nerve ending scarred pain pain aversion sense dismantled please one blow one agonizing punishment one day hell go never let go dont want go never let go happy happy finally become wa always meant sit pure bliss dismantling personhood suddenly without expecting drift eternal slumber last echo pain echoing eternally fried neuron interpret joy salvation enter heaven wa fooled believe,sometimes want tortured,lonely person 789,2564,32,lonely person 789 edit probably nsfw probably safe anyone amp x200b sometimes wish wa kidnapped imprisoned mercilessly tortured wouldnt think anything wouldnt failure social outcast emotional burden raw pain someone torture ever cruelly entire wrapped pain trying survive another 30 second give pain give accept friend beg relish sweet agony held inch death without ever able reach would beg maybe would trained hurt would devise punishment air world see much sack meat take would reaction certain thing would scream convulse rip hair try strangle would bash head wall passing awaken red hot iron burning foot would forced walk glass long could smile circumstance would take convince chop hand beg allowed eat would even allowed speak would tongue cut skewered maybe sleep deprivation would worst allowed lie sit crouch would play dart face would smash finger hammer would make sit still without moving week make beg flex single muscle promise would listen say mind soul gone nothing plaything designed exact revenge think worst enemy worst thing ha ever lived tear tear apart tear world force live wretched miserable piece garbage want beg end never quite get month year decade old age mind twisted stunted longer human nerve ending scarred pain pain aversion sense dismantled please one blow one agonizing punishment one day hell go never let go dont want go never let go happy happy finally become wa always meant sit pure bliss dismantling personhood suddenly without expecting drift eternal slumber last echo pain echoing eternally fried neuron interpret joy salvation enter heaven wa fooled believe sometimes want tortured

Could Really Use Some Help...,"This looks like the right community to post in, so I really hope that someone, anyone, can help talk me out of this..

I married up. My wife’s family comes from immense wealth. I’ve always strived to provide her with the same type of life that she grew accustomed to growing up, but eventually, my sales commissions slowed down, and my gambling and credit cards debts only increased, trying to keep up this fake lifestyle I knew I could never maintain, but was too much of a pussy to admit to failing at.

Now, I’ve been taking 2 mg of Xanax (no prescription) for 6 fucking years. My credit cards are maxed. Hell I even just got hit by the IRS for a $10K Audit (payment due in 2 weeks). I’ve closed my 401K, I’m out of savings, I can no longer continue to live this lie.

I know that everyone will tell me to go seek therapy. But why? What’s the fucking point? I failed. My problems will still exist during and after therapy.

It seems like the best option for me is to take the 30 2 mg benzos I have, drink a couple of bottles of wine, and write a letter to my loved ones.

I’m writing this not because I want to, but because I am literally at my edge. I don’t know any other way out. I know that this is cowardly. I know that this will hurt my family, my wife, all of my friends. But every single day that I wake up, in enormous debt, hating my job, it feels like the best solution is suicide.

"Compassion or competency, you may only choose one.","I'm going to take the plunge. My life's been a bitter mess up until this point, it's not getting any better, and anyone who says otherwise is living a vastly different life than I have. They truly have no clue what they're talking about.

I just have to ask, before I do anything. Why have the people with the competency needed to change my life around dropped the ball each and every time I reached out to them? As much as I love my friends and family for trying (well, most of them), they just plain sucked at making me feel better. They said the wrong things in their attempt and just drove me further down into this abyss. I didn't need them, as much as I appreciated their attempts. 

I needed someone who understands why I feel this way. I needed someone who went to medical school for eight years, took every psychology course offered, and knows every single tick of the human brain to help sort out my emotions. I needed someone who could give me answers, and solutions.

But when I try to reach out to these people? Nothing. They just didn't have it in them to give a fuck. And I don't understand. You took this job to help people, but you refused to help me. My psychiatrist upped my antidepressants to near-toxic levels and then yanked me off of them completely, My counselors passed me around like they were playing a game of hot potato. My latest counselor didn't even make it to our appointment earlier today. If they found it in them to give a shit, they could have helped. I believe that with every ounce of my being. But they didn't, they just didn't. 

So reddit, answer that question for me, so I can finally find peace.

How did it get to this..,"Posting on a page full of people who don’t know my story.. Who do know the real me.. in reality, no one does. I don’t even know who I am anymore.

I don’t know what my life has turned in to. Nothing brings me joy anymore. I feel like I’m forced to keep my mouth shut about how I’m feeling because it makes other people (my wife) feel uncomfortable. 

I have no friends, I dropped everyone I used to talk to because I was heavy in the drug scene. I have no family out here, my dad killed himself back in 2016 (it will be 4 years on oct 29th). 

I thought I did everything right. I got clean, I have a good paying job. I bust my ass and work hard every single fucking day. 

My wife doesn’t care. Sex isn’t the same. Our love isn’t the same. Her mind is on other men (I’m 27f btw). 

My family has a history of fucked up mental illnesses. Im reaching a point in my life where reality and the voices in my head are all starting to blur together. 

Death sounds so much better than life. I’ve experimented more over the past couple of weeks with cutting. It’s fine.. but my ultimate goal is to kill myself by hanging. I can’t take this shit anymore. I’m tired of being being an empty shell of who I used to be.

Tired of getting triggered all the time,"A few days ago I wrote down a ""before I die"" list. Those are the things I want to do before I die. I have ""getting IKEA meatballs"" on it, so it'll be a while before that happens. There are only 2 things on that list. I couldn't think of others. 

I've been struggling with depression / anxiety for a while. Don't even remember when I started suicidal ideation, it's never really active (to the point where I would make plans) so I didn't notice when it began. Quarantine has really taken a toll on me (as a lot of other people) and I find myself incredibly lonely and exhausted and unmotivated all / most of the time. I'm a college student and I'm barely keeping up with classes, and that's only because my profs are understanding (about quarantine in general) and give a lot of extensions. At the beginning of the school year I had a few friends I tried to get dinner at least once a week with, but it has fizzled out as people get busy (and other reasons). 

Recently I'm finding myself getting triggered (panic attacks, unstoppable crying, etc.) by so many things. Most of them are related to people I've had a romantic / sexual relationship with (which all ended negatively). Some of these people I have not seen for over 3 years. And yet my friends could mention them, or I could just remember them and I would get extremely upset and be unable to do anything for a day. I usually would take the day off and just stay in bed and wait for the feeling to pass and eventually it does. But it happens again and again and I'm so tired of not being able to control my own emotions. I have such vivid memories of these people that every time this happens I replay every single action and word of our interactions. And it's like reliving the feeling of being worthless and replaceable and dumb and being abandoned and not wanted again and again. I'm scared of talking to friends because I worry they will mention something that triggers me (I have a pretty small social circle so most everyone I know knows one another); I'm scared of sleeping because of the nightmares I get. I just feel so out of control of my life. 

My coping mechanism is a yearly ritual that I do every birthday. I promised myself I would not consider suicide seriously until my birthday. On the night of my birthday I ask myself whether I want to live for another year or not. And I know where and when I would do it, should I decide not to.

But recently I have been thinking about different locations and times, thinking those would be fine as well. Which just adds to the lack of control I feel about my life. 

I have a psychiatrist that I go to weekly, but I still don't know how to talk to her about my suicide ideation. I don't want to be sent to the hospital. And most of the time it feels like we're talking about the most recent crisis. I never know how to start talking about this with her.

I Can't Keep Doing This,"I'm trying my best to find a reason to keep living - a reason to hope. But...I can't keep living like this. 

I feel like an absolute failure. All my close friends are married, having kids, and are years into their careers while I'm floundering aroand and unable to make things work. I'm not lovable - and I'm not just talking about romantically. I don't have any redeemable qualities; I know everyone else's lives would be better if I died. It's embarrassing to feel this way, too, since I've always identified as a Christian...but now I don't know if God even cares. I feel ashamed of being religious, and I feel ashamed of my doubts. I just...I feel like I'm a fuck up no mattet what I do.

I absolutely hate who I am and really want to kill myself. I fantasize about various methods constantly. I know my life won't get any better. i don't have any hope for myself. I just wish I had someone who'd help me end my life since I'm too much of a coward to end it all. I wish my friends understood how soul crushing it is to live a life that will never have meaning.

Should I tell my family?,"Ok so a few years ago when I was a sophomore in high school I bought a noose from our local Walmart so that I could hang myself. I almost attempted suicide but I chickened out in the last minute out of fear. I then went home with my noose after failing to kill myself and hid the noose under my bed.

That noose stayed there for 2 in a half years until I recently threw it out at few months ago because I wasn’t as suicidal right now compared to how I was a few years ago. 

I’m doing better right now, but I still have thoughts of killing myself at times. I love my family and I don’t want to see them in pain because they lost their child to suicide. Should I tell my family my that I almost attempted suicide a few years ago or should I move on and keep it private?

I mean if you think about it, if I were to successfully commit suicide right now, my family would be upset right. If I were to successfully commit suicide after telling my family that I use to be suicidal in the past, they would still be upset. No matter if I told them I was suicidal or not, they would still have the same reaction if I were to kill myself.

So I don’t see any benefit for telling my family about my suicidal thoughts ESPECIALLY when my last attempt was a long time ago. Should I say anything to them, or should I just keep it to myself?",Myles2002,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jh7k9y/should_i_tell_my_family/,ok year ago wa sophomore high school bought noose local walmart could hang almost attempted suicide chickened last minute fear went home noose failing kill hid noose bed noose stayed 2 half year recently threw month ago suicidal right compared wa year ago better right still thought killing time love family want see pain lost child suicide tell family almost attempted suicide year ago move keep private mean think successfully commit suicide right family would upset right successfully commit suicide telling family use suicidal past would still upset matter told wa suicidal would still reaction kill see benefit telling family suicidal thought especially last attempt wa long time ago say anything keep,tell family,myles 2002,1325,24,myles 2002 ok year ago wa sophomore high school bought noose local walmart could hang almost attempted suicide chickened last minute fear went home noose failing kill hid noose bed noose stayed 2 half year recently threw month ago suicidal right compared wa year ago better right still thought killing time love family want see pain lost child suicide tell family almost attempted suicide year ago move keep private mean think successfully commit suicide right family would upset right successfully commit suicide telling family use suicidal past would still upset matter told wa suicidal would still reaction kill see benefit telling family suicidal thought especially last attempt wa long time ago say anything keep tell family

I’m suicidal. My uncle just committed suicide. My brother committed suicide 10 years ago.,"I’m 23M and I’ve been on the edge of suicide for 4 months. Tonight I got the call that my uncle just took his life. He was one of the most important people in my life, he was always there for me when I was depressed. 
10 years ago my older brother committed suicide when he was 19. It was devastating for my family. My parents have been worried sick about me for months, scared to death that they are going to lose another son, and then this news came. My uncle was very close with both of them.

I have no idea how I am going to find the strength to deal with this. One minute I am fantasizing about my own suicide and the next I am losing another family member to suicide, seeing my family devastated again. I feel like I can never take my life because it would just be unbearable for my family, but my life as it is is unbearable for me.

I had a full blown manic episode in May, completely lost my mind and ruined my life. My girlfriend of 3 years left me and I alienated all of my friends (also in a new city). I have tried pills, tried therapy, it hasn’t worked for me. I’ve accepted that there is no help out there and I have to help myself but I am so weak, I was already crushed and now I have no idea how I can carry on. I haven’t finished college and don’t have any career path, so I started an electrician apprenticeship and now I am freezing my ass off everyday thinking this is definitely not for me, but just dreading having no plan for the future if I quit. 
I seriously don’t believe I will ever make friends or have a girlfriend again. I deeply fear that I will finally put my life back together and things will be okay, then I will have another manic episode and ruin everything again. I don’t see how I will ever be able to have a family or even take care of myself. My ex left me for that very reason.

I can’t do this (life), but I can’t do this to my family either (suicide). My existence was already hell and now I am just in a place that no word has been made up to describe.",BarelyAlive666,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jh4nod/im_suicidal_my_uncle_just_committed_suicide_my/,23m edge suicide 4 month tonight got call uncle took life wa one important people life wa always wa depressed 10 year ago older brother committed suicide wa 19 wa devastating family parent worried sick month scared death going lose another son news came uncle wa close idea going find strength deal one minute fantasizing suicide next losing another family member suicide seeing family devastated feel like never take life would unbearable family life unbearable full blown manic episode may completely lost mind ruined life girlfriend 3 year left alienated friend also new city tried pill tried therapy worked accepted help help weak wa already crushed idea carry finished college career path started electrician apprenticeship freezing everyday thinking definitely dreading plan future quit seriously believe ever make friend girlfriend deeply fear finally put life back together thing okay another manic episode ruin everything see ever able family even take care ex left reason life family either suicide existence wa already hell place word ha made describe,suicidal uncle committed suicide brother committed suicide 10 year ago,barely alive 666,2000,89,barely alive 666 23m edge suicide 4 month tonight got call uncle took life wa one important people life wa always wa depressed 10 year ago older brother committed suicide wa 19 wa devastating family parent worried sick month scared death going lose another son news came uncle wa close idea going find strength deal one minute fantasizing suicide next losing another family member suicide seeing family devastated feel like never take life would unbearable family life unbearable full blown manic episode may completely lost mind ruined life girlfriend 3 year left alienated friend also new city tried pill tried therapy worked accepted help help weak wa already crushed idea carry finished college career path started electrician apprenticeship freezing everyday thinking definitely dreading plan future quit seriously believe ever make friend girlfriend deeply fear finally put life back together thing okay another manic episode ruin everything see ever able family even take care ex left reason life family either suicide existence wa already hell place word ha made describe suicidal uncle committed suicide brother committed suicide 10 year ago

I'm so tired,"Trigger warning for abuse and sexual assault, im not sure how to tag this but I dont want anyone to relive any bad experiences. Im sorry.

I don't really know where to put this. I'm not familiar with forums or social media (I had to do some research to create this account). I just dont have anyone right now.  
I realize that my problems must seem stupid or meaningless. They feel like that to me too.

I think everything got worse the day I was born. My mother is mentally ill and suicidal and ever since i was a toddler i was told every day how I made her want to kill herself, how I ruined her life, how I shouldn't have been born. She's said it over and over and still says it now. I want to leave but I know she'll try to hurt me more or the rest of my family members. I'll also ruin all of our relationships. I know if i go, I can't make any contact with them ever again. I'm stuck.

My mother often gets violent when upset and mumbles to herself and throws things. Sometimes she hits me or tries to strangle me. My other family members are aware of this but never did anything because almost everyone in our family is scared of her.  They're not aware of how she molested me when i was nine years old though. I never told anyone because I knew it would ruin our family and I don't want to make everyone else suffer more than I already have. 

I'm conflicted on my mother. She often does spoil me with gifts and food, but I feel no emotional connection to her, and i feel uncomfortable acknowledging her as my mother. I don't feel like she's my mom. She's not afraid to hurt me if something doesn't go her way or threaten suicide or self harm. 

I think im unfortunately a lot like her. I have a boyfriend and friends, so I should be grateful, but all I do is cry and hurt myself and at this point, i'm sure they're all tired of me and hate me.

Today my boyfriend and I got into a disagreement or something. I don't know. I had a nightmare and began crying and shaking. He rather coldly said to calm down and i stopped to avoid angering him. He's kind and selfless but i'm selfish and i wear him out. I told him how disgusting I was and he got upset and said no. I asked him if he hated me. He said no. He asked if he should just leave, something out of the ordinary. He's never said something like this before and i began crying and said he could leave me if he wanted. He got upset again. I apologized for being the worst partner ever. He left without saying goodbye and that was it. I hate myself for making him so miserable.

I can't trust my friends to talk about this with. One would panic if I talked about suicide. I dont think i trust the others enough. 

I just want to end it all. I make everyone upset and distressed. I know i have no value by continuing to live and my life is only getting to go worse, i feel like a ticking time bomb at this point. Sooner or later I know i'll kill myself. I'm not the sort of person who has any value or worth. I feel disgusted knowing I'm alive, and I've caused so much damage.

I dont know what to do. Im not looking for some ""you can do it! you've lived this long"". I've heard it before and it isn't true. I'm just weak.

Am i worth anything at all?

I'm sorry this post is all over the place. I just want to fall asleep over and over and hope that at some point I don't wake up anymore.

Y’all I’m not okay,"Over a month ago a friend in my friend group committed suicide. It’s hit everyone hard. But I’m on the outside. I’m very close to people that were close to him but he and I only had a handful of interactions. Interactions that are important to me and that I’m grateful to have had but in a strange way I don’t feel valid to grieve for him. Yet his departure still hurts immensely. 

This however is not the first suicide to rock my social circle. 

It’s hit hard every times but it’s hit different every time. It has been so far removed that the empathy is there but the pain isn’t. It’s hit so close that I’ve cried for months and felt pain that I was sure I would never recover from. 

I’ve seen and experienced suicide first hand. I see how it wrecks and rips and breaks friends and families and lovers. 

So here I am. 

I can not possibly inflict the pain of suicide onto the people who know me and have befriended me on the crazy ride we call life. I love them and care for them too much to do that to them. 

But it is painful to live. It is painful to feel my heart break and to feel so fucked up and broken and worthless.

Ive attempted one more.,"This is my second post here. I’m not sure if I mentioned this but my partner bought me to his parents house because of how suicidal I can be around my family. I am grateful but at the same time I have attempted suicide more time being at his parents than I have my entire lifetime. 

He has a load of exes who are now his friends but they very clearly flirt with him infront of me and he does not notice at all. Not only that but he then goes and defends their actions and chooses to not respond to me at all. One of his exes threatened to beat me up and he chose to comfort her instead of me. I have been abused in the past so something like this can be very triggering to me. He knows this. 

He has told my depression story to all his exes and all of them have either called me a bitch or lame and he agreed with them all and even went on to say how he doesn’t even love me and doesn’t see a future with me but when me and him are alone he says the opposite to me. 

I feel soo much more alone now that I am living in his house because I really don’t have anywhere I can escape to. I dont have friends whose house I can go to as everyone I know is shielding. 

Yesterday night was the worst. He took me to his exes house and she was literally flirting and making sure I knew. My partner was also laughing extra hard at things she said which weren’t funny at all. I asked him about this when we got back and he didn’t answer me for 3 hours. I overdosed because I feel soo alone with everything else going on. Theres soo much more to this before anyone says “why do it over a guy”. I have been suicidal since the age of 8 and everytime i think I’ve found a reason to live, it goes the other way. 

It has been over 12 hours since my OD and the effects are now working. I have a stomach ache and headache.

I’ve made too many mistakes,"There is so much shit I’ve gon through like everyone and I just don’t feel strong enough to handle my thoughts anymore. I hurt everyone I know through selfish decisions. I feel like I can’t win or even get a leg up in life. The biggest thing on my mind is how I’ve treated my girlfriend. I’ve been with her for almost a year and early in our relationship I secretly solicited sexual pictures from other girls. I have no idea why I did that. I wasn’t unhappy with my relationship, and it wasn’t out of spite. I just did without thinking. And I regret it 100% because I didn’t enjoy any of the pictures. I felt horrible. And my relationship isn’t fantastic as were both codependent (I think) and we have trust issues with each other. And I want to break up with her for her sake but we’re just in too deep with our relationship. I feel like I’m 100% locked in. I’ve met her family and she’s met mine, and I feel like she’s unhappy all the time with me but she doesn’t want to break up. I’m afraid she’d become suicidal if we broke up which is what’s also keeping me from doing it. I made stupid ass mistakes and now I want to kill myself to escape them. I sincerely HATE myself.

This is the fourth time I've tried to write this. I want to make it clear that this is not a joke, it's not a game, it's something that's really happening. I no longer know how many years I have been in this state, a state of depression, anxiety and chronic and severe insomnia. You have no idea what it is like to live in a state of intense fear and loneliness for so many years in a row. But ok, maybe we were not all made to live, some of us are faced with a life predestined to suffering and injustice, but honestly, who said that life was just. My whole existence is a mistake, my life failed, now it makes no sense that I am still here. I will not waste time talking about everything that brought me to this point. If I write this here, it is because it may be my last post and my last written words. My parents believe I was healed of depression a long time ago, but it wasn't, that was just a little pause, then I fell back, I just pretended I was healed so they could rest.

Hello?,"F(17)I cried infront of my friends and mom today. I don't know what to do anymore. Should I just email my school and tell them I'm suicidal and watch what happens next? Or should I just wait til I'm 18(next year) to get therapy. I'm at my breaking point, not now but my breaking point to actually fucking kill myself or run away TO kill myself or willingly get kidnapped and murdered, whatever type of death. I'm so close to just break and go die. This sounds literally so fucking ass I know, but. I feel so bad my mom has to deal with me. She doesn't care about my mental health, all she wants me to do is clean and shit and I don't do it (sometimes I do) , most bc I'm constantly dragging myself to even do thingsm I'm failing my classes, I'm pushing my friends away.

 lately I've felt so generous to give my friends home-made meals for them because they DESERVE meals and love. I just feel like giving everything I have, my love, my care, my food, my stuff, my joy. I feel like if I give everything away and watch and attend my friends birthdays before this year ends. I can finally kill myself and let everything go. I'll miss my mom, I'll miss my mom so much I just want to spend time with my mom before I go, my friends my cousin I want to spend my time with them before I can kill myself at the end of this year or soon. Maybe I won't but I have a feeling I will. I might fuck around maybe.

pros and cons,"my whole life ive been called stupid, like seriously by everyone. it started in kindergarten and continued every year until sophomore year of college, I had teachers (and peers) consistently tell me i can't do anything right, maybe if i was smarter people would like me more, asked me why i need so much help all the time and to stop asking questions. all this gave me an intelligence complex, so even though I have almost a 4.0 in college, I still get set off very easily when someone implies that I'm not smart or when a situation makes me look incompetent. I know I come across as stupid and I don't know how to fix it, I think i am masking a moderate case of autism because social situations never come naturally and as a kid I had no idea what was going on or how to communicate anything. Today, people think I'm a bimbo and tell me that i assume i don't need to know anything because i'm ""pretty"" but i hate the way i look and i have no self confidence whatsoever. i have friends but i'm just a joke to them, they only see me as entertainment and its obvious I'm barely even seen as a human being, same goes for my family. lots of guys want to hook up with me but never want anything serious because I'm a shell of a person, despite the years of character development provided by bullying. I'm anxious, twitchy, I talk like i have a marble in my mouth, have trouble making eye contact, people look away when I'm talking to them and start their own conversations. It's devastating to realize that if you died people might feel sad but no one could say they were really close with you. All I want are close relationships and the ability to make conversation with people, to be someone worthy of basic respect.

Anyway I've been depressed since childhood but something that happened yesterday made me pretty sure that I don't want to be alive. I finally built up the courage to try to get my driver's license after the trauma of my friend dying in an accident while I was taking driver's ed as a 15 y/o. My mom, who knew I was nervous, drove me there and screamed at me the entire time for not filling up the tank with gas (with what money, with license?), I asked her to stop, i'm not neurotypical and I knew i wouldn't be able to focus on the test. When we got there my hands were shaking and i was holding back tears. The instructor was aggressive with me (he got angry with me when I asked him to repeat himself once). I didn't fully understand his vague instructions and I was already upset, but I was scared to ask for clarification because all my life teachers have demeaned me for asking questions. I did my best to complete the test but when I was finished the instructor told my mom to reschedule a new test because I'm incompetent and I just do whatever I want with no concern for anyone else, and I'm so sure of myself for no reason. That hurt deeply for reasons I can't totally explain. It showed me that no matter how good my intentions are, people are just unnecessarily cruel and that there's a huge disconnect between who i really am and how people perceive me. I wish I was able to communicate better and understand/ be understood.

People's opinions shouldn't matter but how else do you construct an identity? I have no reason to have a single shred of self worth because I'm constantly demeaned and picked apart (even by strangers). maybe this is a bad example but it's just the tip of the iceberg. the rules of social interaction make no sense to me. I'm boring and I'm dull. I find myself inadvertently stealing aspects of people's personalities all the time (someone told me this might be a symptom of autism). Maybe i'm just too sensitive for this world.

After the driving test, my mom is so willing to believe the worst about me, saying I'm so smug, I never even try to listen to anyone. I cry on the way home because I realize this is all I have to look forward to for the rest of my life. I try so hard to understand things but nothing ever makes any sense the way it seems to for others. Later I finally tell my mom I don't want to live and have felt this way for a very long time. She calls my psychiatrist on her cell that night (who knows nothing of my depression &amp; just prescribes adderall for me) and tells her that I'm acting erratic, I'm threatening suicide, etc. when I was very calm and explained I have no plans to hurt myself, just a passive death wish (not entirely true). We went to the hospital and then resolved to find me a therapist soon.

It's come to the point where I'm making pros/ cons lists but all the pros are being eclipsed by these dark thoughts.

1. Finally being in a relationship. I've been in love with this man from college for three years now. I've only really been with him. we hooked up for a whole year and a half and I think he was only sleeping with me during that time. I haven't seen him since last December before he got a girlfriend. They broke up a few months ago and he's been texting me recently (he's never really done this before, I guess he's just bored) sweet messages and calling me love and beautiful, saying that he admires the way I advocate for marginalized communities. I've never had someone treat me this kindly and it feels odd. Last year when I was sick for a month, he even said he missed me when my best friends didn't even reach out to me. Part of me thinks he genuinely likes me and, as sad as it sounds, it's the main thing that's made me hesitate about killing myself, but if he knew how stupid i am and how much baggage and sadness I have, he wouldn't want me. It just feels like it's never going to happen for me and one of the major reasons I wanted to get my license was so that I could finally hang out with him. I won't rely on someone else for happiness, I know how fleeting that is, but it would help me dig myself out of this dark hole.
2. Grad school. My only dream since middle school was to get into Harvard one day to prove that I am, in fact, smart. I thought that would fix everything- myself, my soul, my life. I've worked so hard in undergrad despite my learning differences, picked a challenging double major + minor, plenty of extracurriculars. I've given up on all of it, I've barely done any homework all semester and I don't see the point if I'm going to end my life.
3. The off chance that my future will be better than my past and present. The only time in my life I've ever felt like I had something to offer the world was in 8th grade when I performed a monologue and my drama teacher pulled me aside and said ""I'm not blowing bubbles up your butt. You have real talent and could make it a profession if you wanted to."" I thought she was just being nice but she even recorded my monologue and showed it in front of the entire class saying that I had an incredible gift for acting and they could all learn from me. She continued to urge me to go into acting throughout that year and the next year saying she's not kidding and she's never seen talent like mine before in someone who was not a professional actor (perhaps a lifetime of sadness has some fringe benefits). I don't know why ever since I fell into this deep depression I have been thinking of that for the first time in years when I haven't even done any acting at all since then. Maybe it's a sign, I have no idea. I do know that if I die there's no chance of finding out if she was right.

Recently, however, I've been having some bizarre OCD superstitions wherein I feel like my dead grandpa is communicating with me through angel numbers. His lucky number was 777 and I've been seeing it a lot, as well as 666. I take this to mean that it's time to kill myself and finally find peace. I'm not schizophrenic, just raised to be superstitious plus I have OCD so it's easy to get carried away. I also feel strangely connected to two former students at my college who died by suicide at my same grade, in my same major, who grew up in the same area that I did. I feel like even if i try to choose life, it's just going to happen to me like i'm powerless to stop this fatal trajectory.

Overstayed my welcome on Earth,"**This is mainly just a massive vent so please don't read it if you're in a bad place right now, there's just no one I trust to say it to in person so might as well do it anonymously on the internet.**

I feel like I overstayed my welcome on Earth. I’ve felt like this for a really, long time and feeling guilt all the time about it. cuz I was lucky enough to have one of the most kind-hearted and loveliest Mom’s you could ask for. So, I keep trying, I function pretty good. I stay hygienic (p messy room tho), I go to work, I call the family members I am close with (prob not enough), I take care of my pets, I try and see my friends when I am up for it. I usually just like coming home and being alone though. 

The close friends I have or had I guess, I always had a feeling they didn’t actually care about me or my space/boundaries and they recently verified that in my heart. They never did make much of an effort when I think about it, not in the way I see them with each other or other friends. The other friends I have I feel like they’re just nice to me cuz they’re hoping we will get into a relationship, it feels like the niceties I am shown always just lead to something more sexually intimate than I think I want, idk I just have an ache in my chest I feel like no one actually cares about me except for my close family and that makes me feel so guilty about this constant gnawing thought in my head that’s just always there.

 I have good days; I have a lot of good, normal days but I just feel like this place isn’t for me. I don’t even know if I want to get better. I’m typing this out and crying while also messaging people back on my discord in a totally Normal Happy Way it just feels Wild I feel caught between trying to just get by each day, trudging into some future and just wanting to get the fuck out of it and it's like that with most things. I started cleaning out my room cuz it got Too Depression Den and I can't tell if I'm doing it to get my shit together or to make sure no one else has to deal with it in case I just leave. Whatever it is it's motivating me to do it at least. Small victories. Very long ramble I am sorry. I hope no one got brought down by my venting and you’re all doing the best you can as well.

When the things keeping you here are almost not enough anymore,"For me it’s my best friend, her 2 year old son, and my boyfriend. 

I want to see him grow up, I want to be his fun auntie and spoil him, and see him become the gentleman I know he will be... but recently I’ve been telling myself (as I don’t see them incredibly often and with COVID even less) that he probably doesn’t recognize me yet. That I haven’t touched his life in a way he’ll remember when he’s older, so instead of robbing him of one of his aunties later down the line, why not now when I’m still a stranger?

My friend is amazing, we’ve been friends for over a decade. We’ve had ups and downs, the downs have made our bond stronger and the ups have been some of the best moments of my life. We do not talk everyday, sometimes even for a week, with life being busy but we always pickup right where we left off. She would be absolutely devastated but she’s also one of the strongest women I know and she will get past it for herself, and for her son, she will carry on. 

And then my boyfriend... we’re in a rough place on the verge of breaking-up. Though, the relationship is not what’s holding me, it’s the guilt of the devastation that he would feel that would spiral him down as dark a path as I’m on, and I can’t yet willingly send him here.

But I’m close. So close. The break-up could be straw that broke the camels back.

I wish I was just terminally ill or got into an accident on the street. At least the people I’d be leaving wouldn’t have to feel like they didn’t do enough.",_chatalie,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jh284z/when_the_things_keeping_you_here_are_almost_not/,best friend 2 year old son boyfriend want see grow want fun auntie spoil see become gentleman know recently telling see incredibly often covid even le probably recognize yet touched life way remember older instead robbing one aunty later line still stranger friend amazing friend decade ups made bond stronger ups best moment life talk everyday sometimes even week life busy always pickup right left would absolutely devastated also one strongest woman know get past son carry boyfriend rough place verge breaking though relationship holding guilt devastation would feel would spiral dark path yet willingly send close close break could straw broke camel back wish wa terminally ill got accident street least people leaving feel like enough,thing keeping almost enough anymore,chat lie,1494,62,chat lie best friend 2 year old son boyfriend want see grow want fun auntie spoil see become gentleman know recently telling see incredibly often covid even le probably recognize yet touched life way remember older instead robbing one aunty later line still stranger friend amazing friend decade ups made bond stronger ups best moment life talk everyday sometimes even week life busy always pickup right left would absolutely devastated also one strongest woman know get past son carry boyfriend rough place verge breaking though relationship holding guilt devastation would feel would spiral dark path yet willingly send close close break could straw broke camel back wish wa terminally ill got accident street least people leaving feel like enough thing keeping almost enough anymore

Companionship just isn't the thing that makes me want life, only makes me hate the fact I'm hurting yet more people. While there, I literally had to take sleeping medication because the depressive thoughts were so intense I couldn't sleep. There are people in there that, if they find out I passed away, will be shattered by it. I was told by one that I'm the only person she's ever met that's completely relaxed her anxiety. Told by another that I was the first person to ever truly believe in her ability and be sincere about it. And this is how I repay that kindness. This is what I do to the people who show me they care about me.

There's a quote from my favorite manga that perfectly describes how I'm feeling at this moment. It reads 

""I'm back in my room that I am all too familiar with. There is a feeling of relief that envelops me as I return to my world. It flaunts that I never truly did a thing to move forward. The feelings I'd bottled inside came bursting out: ""Everyone around me is just leaving me further and further behind. Just what am I supposed to work hard at now?""

I'm really over all the bad luck and hurt,"I had to quit my job 2 back in 2018 because I tore my ACL and wasn't going to be able to commute around NYC anymore. I worked at hard to get to that job, and then I had to leave it and move back with my parents in Florida to get knee surgery and recover. I spent 9 months in physical therapy so that I could start this crud country road trip I always wanted to do. I was finally about to leave for my trip, and I went out with an old hometown friend as a final good-bye, and the idiot got too drunk and tried to fight me. He shoved me over causing me to re-tear my ACL. 9 months of physical therapy all for nothing. I had to get surgery again and delay my road trip for another year. I continued living with my parents feeling like a loser and trapped by my injuries. And my Dad is really mean to me and was charging me rent money even though I didn't have work and didn't even want to be there, I just needed a place to heal up. Finally a year later, on my road trip and it was going good at first. But for the past 2 months it's been nothing but bad luck. The girl I love stopped talking to me a few days ago, my motorcycle got stolen last week while my van was at the mechanic, then my skateboard snapped in half, and now my van is broken down again.

Ups and downs and ups... And downs again,"I've been recently diagnosed with depression, while doing my thesis, during a global pandemic.
I know that maybe I'm victimizing myself, but I'm really struggling to deal with everything.
I've spoken to my thesis tutor and she was very comprehensive regarding the diagnostic and said that it was OK to move slowly now, with the work I've been developing.
Now, I'm just trying to be active. I'm taking some medication, prescribed by the doctor. But despite feeling ""Ok"" in some days and trying to hold every single piece of shit together, it sometimes crumbles down and intrusive, depressive thoughts come, once again.
2 weeks ago I was at my low I think. I though about ending it all, disappearing from the face of the world. It got me wondering if I never existed in the first place and how good that would be. The peace that it would bring. I just wanted to die.
I confessed some of this to my boyfriend and I really thought he understood me. But sometimes, I also thinks he judges everything that I do (and mainly don't do) or that I poorly execute. My self esteem is at the lowest point in my life so far (I'm 22 years old) and I'm just tired of feeling better, believing that it gonna be OK from now on, just to understand that, in the next day I had another breakdown that does not let me get out of bed. I also think that he looks at me like I'm a burden and I really do not want to be that. Besides, I think he finally understood that I'm a failure, unable to finish my master degree. 

Somedays I wish I was never brought into this world. Today is one of those days.

Will it ever get better?

I feel my life is just nothing
Student life: It has been 2 years since I dropped out of university and settled for an office job.
I feel I'll never amout to something.
I've lost sight of my goals, don't feel I have a path anymore, and I'm settling for whatever comes my way, and honestly I loathe myself for just dropping half way through my chemistry BA. 

The reason I stopped going to university is because I hot a slump on calculus 2 and organic chemistry 2, I tried over and over but just couldn't understand them in theory. Repeated both courses 3 times without success. I feel I'm dumb and incompetent. I've never been good at asking for help so I just drowned in my frustrations. Then I hear ""why not go back and finish?"" First of all I barely can remember the basics of chemistry, secondly, I was dumb enough to verify the market for what I wanted to do (pharmaceutical) and saw it was bottlenecked which further threw me off. Sadly I've got no other interest or potential for other fields. Suck at art, music (creative stuff in general) can't handle blood or needles so medicine field is off the map, I'm horrible at math so I doubt accounting. Don't care about politics, and is just a horrible field, can't say I'm humanistic enough to try social sciences. There's no way I'll ever be a teacher, can't stand being around raging teens/kids. 

Current career: work at an insurance company, I'm somewhat good at it, at least I don't mess up and from time to time fix someone else's screw ups. My workmates seem to appreciate me, but that only extends up to work environment, while others drink together and even play games on consoles together I'm left out, even after they asked for gamertag and console, I hear them talk about how they play x games and bla, bla bla. You may have think it was an error /accident they forgot, I did mentioned it and gave my info again, and wrote it on a paper for them, and never got even a message; I get it we're adults and we should be mature about it, but it hurts just knowing that the only reason they are nice is because you're somewhat good at the job and can help them fast on work
Which has made been made obvious by them approaching me at work to verify they did their stuff right. Don't get my hopes up, just tell me you ain't interested on knowing me beyond work. Got derailed from topic, sorry. Back to the point; realistically the skills I've got can barely be transferred to another working area, I see myself yet again on another slump in my life, even though it has been 2 years since I began working; I can't say there's much room for growth in this career line. 

Love life: the record isn't that good been left twice, one in amicable terms, one by a cheater. Yes they have been long relationships but it's apparent I'm a boring person because they leave once they get tired of the monotony. Sorry I ain't so sporadic nor got the money I wish I had to go on trips/vacations. Yes I have been contacted and told they miss me and all, but you know it's as far as it goes. Plus going back is seen as a sin/weakness by my family and friends. 

So I end up asking... What's my purpose, what am I good for, why am I even allowed to breath, I should just fuck off and die, not like the world would care. I'm already a disappointment to myself and others, so why drag the charade? It becomes more pointless the longer I live.

Anyways I'm too much of a failure. I've tried ending myself 3 times before but I've failed, just like in everything else in life.

it's rude to have guests over if you're dead,"my brain keeps yelling at me that i could just take my entire bottle of zoloft right now if i really wanted to and i could die and it'd all be easier. i got diagnosed with bpd earlier this week but i has to be wrong because no one has said anything for the over 10 years i've been in therapy. i'm a bad person, i already know that, and i'm not crazy. i saw this video of a woman who talked about &gt;!writing letters to people in her own blood!&lt; and like i'm crazy i guess but not that crazy. i'm just thinking about dying and i realize no one would miss me and the people who say they would are probably just lying to me because everyone leaves and why would anyone anywhere ever try to help me or actually care? it's just fucking ridiculous imagining that anything good will happen when it never will.   


the only thing keeping me from doing it is that i have a guy coming over to build my pc with me later and i think it'd be kinda rude to invite someone over and then when they show up you're dead. i mean that's giving them an experience they weren't asking for and would probably fuck them up for life.

if anything, this is all just a stupid feeling that's gonna pass later and by the time he leaves i'll be fine.

I’m doing “okay” but dying is still all I think about.,"I’m taking my meds, I’m going to therapy, and generally I’m doing a lot better. I’m not crippled by my depression and anxiety anymore. Yet, I still want to die.

Im only 15.,"I may sound stupid in writing this down here but
I really feel suicidal nearly everyday, i've had countless thoughts to doing it i've attempted to do it once but couldn't, everytime I woke up I felt no reason to why I have to live it seemed that I had no motivation, I always wanted to cry, the belt to the neck was my method due to having many belts in my room.

Everytime I calmly ask my older stepsister for a problem I have with her like invading my privacy or doing whatever she wanted to me she goes beserk on me. I feel really manipulated or controlled, I realized I probably can't do anything about this even if I tried to talk it out so I left this problem running.

My little sister is just the better version of who I am, she does so much things better and isn't like who I am, has people who make her feel better or great at all times, everytime I see her, it immediately reminds me:

""Why am I lonely? Why does she always have it all better? Do I really live on her shadow? I want to be an equal""
I've tried to follow my own path but it was pretty hopeless and that I felt really demotivated, couldn't do it.

My other older stepsister minds whatever I just do and make a complaint out of it or find any reason no matter what over and over, won't mind her own business and again, had to just keep this running because talking it out seems to never work

Im lonely, haven't got friends and ""once again"", seeing my classmates, cousins or family members have the opposite of ""loneliness"" does remind me and tell me ""Why?""
They've got people who care.
I feel no freedom to anything, anything.


Whenever I wanted to tell my parents about a problem, they don't care, they tell me people had it worse and just lay it off think its ok.
Yes, I fully and definitely understand there are definitely many who have had it worse.

Right now, my only thoughts seem to be suicidal ideation and feeling sadness everyday feeling no motivation and being lonely. Don't know when the lights will be off for me. Haven't exactly gave up on life just yet and seeking for a little motivation and change-of-life before more problems kick in and make it worse.",gUmFisT,9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgksw5/im_only_15/,may sound stupid writing really feel suicidal nearly everyday countless thought attempted everytime woke felt reason live seemed motivation always wanted cry belt neck wa method due many belt room everytime calmly ask older stepsister problem like invading privacy whatever wanted go beserk feel really manipulated controlled realized probably anything even tried talk left problem running little sister better version doe much thing better like ha people make feel better great time everytime see immediately reminds lonely doe always better really live shadow want equal tried follow path wa pretty hopeless felt really demotivated older stepsister mind whatever make complaint find reason matter mind business keep running talking seems never work im lonely got friend seeing classmate cousin family member opposite loneliness doe remind tell got people care feel freedom anything anything whenever wanted tell parent problem care tell people worse lay think ok yes fully definitely understand definitely many worse right thought seem suicidal ideation feeling sadness everyday feeling motivation lonely know light exactly gave life yet seeking little motivation change life problem kick make worse,im 15,gum fist,2147,11,gum fist may sound stupid writing really feel suicidal nearly everyday countless thought attempted everytime woke felt reason live seemed motivation always wanted cry belt neck wa method due many belt room everytime calmly ask older stepsister problem like invading privacy whatever wanted go beserk feel really manipulated controlled realized probably anything even tried talk left problem running little sister better version doe much thing better like ha people make feel better great time everytime see immediately reminds lonely doe always better really live shadow want equal tried follow path wa pretty hopeless felt really demotivated older stepsister mind whatever make complaint find reason matter mind business keep running talking seems never work im lonely got friend seeing classmate cousin family member opposite loneliness doe remind tell got people care feel freedom anything anything whenever wanted tell parent problem care tell people worse lay think ok yes fully definitely understand definitely many worse right thought seem suicidal ideation feeling sadness everyday feeling motivation lonely know light exactly gave life yet seeking little motivation change life problem kick make worse im 15

I’ve tried so many times and just my damn luck to be rushed to the hospital. Not sure how it happened the last time since i live alone! Sheer dumb luck! I hate you for rushing me to the hospital. You should have never come! You only pretend to care cause it makes YOU LOOK GOOD! Fuck you!! I only have myself.

"So, I dont usually post anything, but I just want someone to hear my story","So I'm 17 years old, and not attractive at all, and as a bonus, I'm short, 160 or 5'2, I have had suicidal thoughts since I was 13 years old, and I didn't like what I felt, so in the heat of an argument I told her what I felt she said that she would prefer a dead son rather than a bad one, the argument was about why I didn't get A on a math test, I got a B... That hurt alot. Time passed and I started to notice that my friends where getting taller and taller, and I was still the same height, and my insecurities started, and I'm not sure why, but I started to feel like my friends didn't want me there, and the feeling of loneliness started to grow, at first I felt lonely just sometimes, and it kept growing, soon I started to feel it constantly, when I was with friends or my parents, I felt how none wanted me, I felt alone. Then one day about 3 years ago I went to the train tracks that was close to my school, I was just standing there, and wating for a train to run over me, I was ready in felt, I was just texting with some friends wating for the train, then one of my friends that I liked texts me if I want to come over, I swear to God even if I don't belive him, it was like destiny said, nope, not today, and I left, then after a while of walking i could hear the train, and I thought to myself, I could be dead now, and I sad that I will give life a shot, and suddenly it felt better, so me and that girl, I'm going to call her N was starting to become close friends, and I was happy, I loved to make her laugh, she had some problems to and i supported here I all ways I could, I was happy, then one day I told her what I felt and I was so confident that she would feel the same, because she always said that I always maked here laugh her ass off and that she enjoyed to be with me, but she said that I was perfect for her BUT, I was to short, and things started to go down we remained friends, but as the school year was ending 1.5 years ago we went our separate ways, we kept connect during the summer and we still friends, but I started to feel that lonnlienes started to grow, and when school started, she and I where in different schools, she got new friends and she slowly forgot about me. Going from talking to N every day to only a few times a month, that hurts, and now I'm here, a verry short man in a world that only tall and strong men will have the girls, and the thing is, N ist not the biggest problem, but she is one of them, I have a few small ones, and ofcourse the lonnlienes, that's to mutch, being afraid that I will die alone, that no one will love me, I dont know, I'm just afraid and alone",0TheEndIsNear0,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgqrz6/so_i_dont_usually_post_anything_but_i_just_want/,17 year old attractive bonus short 160 5 2 suicidal thought since wa 13 year old like felt heat argument told felt said would prefer dead son rather bad one argument wa get math test got b hurt alot time passed started notice friend getting taller taller wa still height insecurity started sure started feel like friend want feeling loneliness started grow first felt lonely sometimes kept growing soon started feel constantly wa friend parent felt none wanted felt alone one day 3 year ago went train track wa close school wa standing wating train run wa ready felt wa texting friend wating train one friend liked text want come swear god even belive wa like destiny said nope today left walking could hear train thought could dead sad give life shot suddenly felt better girl going call n wa starting become close friend wa happy loved make laugh problem supported way could wa happy one day told felt wa confident would feel always said always maked laugh enjoyed said wa perfect wa short thing started go remained friend school year wa ending 1 5 year ago went separate way kept connect summer still friend started feel lonnlienes started grow school started different school got new friend slowly forgot going talking n every day time month hurt verry short man world tall strong men girl thing n ist biggest problem one small one ofcourse lonnlienes mutch afraid die alone one love dont know afraid alone,dont usually post anything want someone hear story,0 end near 0,2629,74,0 end near 0 17 year old attractive bonus short 160 5 2 suicidal thought since wa 13 year old like felt heat argument told felt said would prefer dead son rather bad one argument wa get math test got b hurt alot time passed started notice friend getting taller taller wa still height insecurity started sure started feel like friend want feeling loneliness started grow first felt lonely sometimes kept growing soon started feel constantly wa friend parent felt none wanted felt alone one day 3 year ago went train track wa close school wa standing wating train run wa ready felt wa texting friend wating train one friend liked text want come swear god even belive wa like destiny said nope today left walking could hear train thought could dead sad give life shot suddenly felt better girl going call n wa starting become close friend wa happy loved make laugh problem supported way could wa happy one day told felt wa confident would feel always said always maked laugh enjoyed said wa perfect wa short thing started go remained friend school year wa ending 1 5 year ago went separate way kept connect summer still friend started feel lonnlienes started grow school started different school got new friend slowly forgot going talking n every day time month hurt verry short man world tall strong men girl thing n ist biggest problem one small one ofcourse lonnlienes mutch afraid die alone one love dont know afraid alone dont usually post anything want someone hear story

I’m at my all time lowest,"
Sorry big vent don’t except people to read it just need to get off my chest, don’t have the confidence to show my friends this or anyone really, sorry for the bad grammar and punctuation I really can’t be bothered fixing it. 

I have always been a quiet kid, well I think i am to be honest I’m not sure anymore I use to always be that happy little kid without a care in the world. I miss him, I miss not caring what I looked like, I miss not caring what I wear, I miss just waking up and only having to worry about school each day. I am just so done every time I try to by myself nothing good ever happens I always fuck it up and ruin everything I don’t know when I stop being me I don’t think I have been myself for a long time now I try to be happy, I try to get to see the positives in my life but i can never seem to be satisfied when them. I didn’t ask to born this way, do you think I want to look like it his, no I wish I was confident but no it’s hard when you have the shittest fucking genetics humanly possible, like how can I work with this cunt. Imagine being the ugliest in the friend group all your life, it hurts, it hurts so much when I like a girl and my friend fucking swoops in this has happened so many fucking times because my self esteem is that fucking low, I can barely look at Myself without criticising myself every morning day and night like how was I ever going succeeded in life when I’m so fucking ugly. I know the worlds not fair, every has their own problems but fuck me, sick of seeing good looking people say life’s hard like fuck I’m sure it is mate I’m sure life must be so miserable waking up looking perfect. That’s my dream. But I know dreams are stupid to hold onto, why try when I can just end it all and finally not have to look in another mirror and cry myself to sleep again and again. I don’t think anyone knows how I feel I have never told anyone any of this because it’s so fucking pathetic I’m legit crying while I type this out, I just wish I was confident enough to just be myself, be yourself they say yeah it’s not that easy I wish it was but I have tried so many times and I can’t handle everyone being happy while I’m faking a smile just to fit in. I just wish I could keep going in and building my confidence but I just can’t everyone is so fucking good at life I am so bad at it everyone seems so carefree and confident and I can barely stare at a mirror for more than 5 seconds before getting depressed. I think I have given up on girls, this is pathetic but I have always longed for a relationship someone to tell all this about, I have always wanted that, it’s the thing I will probably regret the most. I honestly have tried so many times, I don’t blame my friends how can they know how I feel when I barely can fucking talk to a girl I don’t even stare at their face because I don’t want them to look at me because I’m so ugly cunt, imagine that trying to find someone and I can’t even hold eye contact. I don’t know what to do anymore I have been with this friend group since highschool without them I legitimately have almost nothing, I’m already lonely, I already feel left out 90% of the time they do shit i just can’t start over I couldn’t I don’t have the confidence or the drive to care anymore. I lost my best friend years ago we stopped talking he was probably my only real friend I ever had, like a proper proper friend you know and I fucked it up like always. My family don’t know any of this they probably think I’m just a quiet kid but I don’t even know if I am. I feel like I’m not a quiet kid but my Confidence is that low that I have became one. I don’t think I will ever be the person I want to be, I just don’t think I can hold onto that hope, I have always known I’m ugly but when it got brought up with all the boys when we were going out one night and everyone fucking laughs what the fuck am I suppose to do, none of them realise this is probably the worst thing they could do to me, the number one thing I hate about myself and they all laugh and I sit their awkwardly laughing wanted to disappear into thin air, like why do I exist to get tortured on the fucking daily like this I don’t know what else I am suppose to do. I keep thinking I will meet a girl and my life will change but the more I think of it the stupider it fucking  sounds life’s not a movie shits not going magically click into place I’m still going look like a train wreck and want to kill my self every day. This is my lowest point I think I have ever been in my life, I don’t want Attention, fuck I want attention but is that to much to ask probably it’s just so fucked how I can be so insecure about how I look, how, how can this be in the slightest fair I know why no girl ever wants me I don’t even want myself, how will a girl want me if I hate myself it makes no sense, I am so over trying and trying just to fail again and again i wish I had someone I could talk to but my friends are that type of friend if you know what I mean fuck me just why do I bother hanging out with them, why because I have no one else I have nothing I just want to look different I know you will think life won’t suddenly get easy but I fucking think it would, having the confidence to go job interviews having the confidence to make new friends having the confidence to talk to girls having the confidence to just be myself who I was meant to be. I always wanted to just be me, but it’s hard to do when I don’t even know who me is. I don’t think I will ever get to experience that person, I don’t think I will ever be good enough for myself to accept, yes not other people, myself I want to accept me but I can’t, I can’t look in a mirror and smile to myself because what I see looking back at me is so ugly, I hate the word ugly, I hate it it’s such a fucking disgusting word the word is made for me, I’m not ugly like fat or facial features it’s just these fucking moles and freckles I hate the fucking sun I have tried these laser surgery’s they suck the expensive as fuck and I look the same why does this shit exist. Why must I deal with every day while my friends have flawless skin and are so happy it hurts, it hurts to see them have fun without me I don’t even want to know the amount of shit the have probably talked about me I would probably break down and cry till I had no tears left. I can’t see myself getting old having kids I just can’t I can barely see myself getting through this year. My anxiety always gets the best of me and I procrastinate about everything no one ever messages me if I’m okay, I’m not fucking okay, I don’t remember when I was last okay, I wish I was okay but no I’m a pathetic piece of shit that has nothing to show for in life, life is a cruel joke I don’t think I was made to succeed in life I ain’t the main character I’m the shitty side character you walk by and never see again my whole existence is so fucking irrelevant what am suppose to do with myself I just want to be me is that so much to ask, it must be, I don’t think anyone has ever truly known me and they probably never will because I am so fucking lonely and it hurts to even type this out it feels wrong to even talk about how I feel, it doesn’t feel like I deserve to express my emotions I’m just not worth it, in the end we all die I guess, I’m just going have a head start on everyone else. I could keep typing for hours all my emotions have been bottled up for so long I have never spoken to anyone about how I feel, I have been faking smiles left and right for so long now, I wonder what it’s like to be happy to look in the mirror and go fuck me I look good today, I once thought I would get to that point in my life but I seriously cannot be bothered anymore it’s so hard to try when your friends constantly do things that put you down. They don’t do it on purpose though because they don’t know, they don’t know them just being their happy self hurts me so much, I long to be with them laughing, joking with them I know everyone has problems I’m not special I just can’t handle them as-well as others I guess. I have tried, I really think I did my best, well maybe not my best but I definitely did try, getting knocked down again and again, getting back up becomes too much, easier for me to stay down and out. My friend group would be fine without me I don’t except them to come to my funeral, I honestly don’t think I would want them there. I would tell my parents not to worry, they did nothing wrong, I am the problem, not them. I wished I had the courage to show someone this wall of fucking text but I would feel to bad, waiting to see their reaction, them thinking I just want their attention and I’m just making all this shit up, I wish I was but honestly it would be harder to make this shit up. I don’t know where I went wrong, I always was happy when I was younger but as I became more aware things just escalated. Highschool probably was the worst thing someone like me could go through. A situation where popularity is scaled on how u look in vast majority of cases, I wish looks didn’t matter I really wish they didn’t because it’s my greatest fucking flaw the biggest flaw the most important thing in life and oh whoops let’s not give his kid fucking any, he will be fine, it will be a fun experiment to watch him suffer and hate himself for his short life, yes maybe they have placed bets when I would kick the bucket who the hell knows. We are watching the AFL grand final tonight and then going out after going it’s going hurt so much when my friend is with the girl I wanted so fucking bad but my self esteem hit me like freight truck and I barely could speak to her so he slides right on in like I don’t exist and she doesn’t seem to give 2 fucks about me, why would she, why should she care about me when I don’t care about me, it makes no sense, I make no sense I have the stupid concept that a girl will make me happy probably from all those stupid fucking movies where they fall in love and live happily ever after. I know it’s so fucking unrealistic but I still want it so fucking bad, and I can’t, I can’t not want it, I think it’s the one fucking thing I want, nothing else would matter, it probably sounds so stupid but I really thing it would make me happy. I just want to be happy.",Geelong40,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jh34ws/im_at_my_all_time_lowest/,sorry big vent except people read need get chest confidence show friend anyone

Recently my Grandma died and I saw the body today. It sent me in a downward spiral. My boyfriend and I also broke up because he was spending less time with me and more time with other females. He decided to end things on that he wanted to focus on his studies. I understood that and we went our separate ways. I’ve been isolated for a couple of days and I just sat here for the past 45 minutes contemplating taking my life. I made a video and everything. I understand I need help now.

My life is so miserable and the only way I keep myself afloat is through escapism,"I'm 16, I've been severely bullied for almost 2 years now, I've recently discovered a hate page that posts pictures of me with awful, disgusting captions that are used to entice older men. I have an abusive ex that hates my guts and leaked my nudes. I run the risk of going homeless because my father is so in debt with the utilities and he barely pays our bills. My mom has age-inappropriate expectations for me and treats me as if I'm her therapist, I'm expected to also juggle AP classes at school, study for my SATs and obviously do well.

There is nothing redeemable about my life. There used to be, but now I cannot think of anything. The only thing that keeps me afloat is escapism, whether that's chasing after a crush or a partner, locking myself in my room for hours, listening to music, etc.. I am genuinely so miserable. I want to die, I really do want to die. I haven't thought about it in a while but that's because I always act like things aren't as bad as they really are.

What now?,"Life of trauma. Eating disorder. Severe anxiety and depressive episodes. Self harm. I'm also struggling financially, dealing with bad self hate and generally waking up every day in mental agony. 

What happens when you genuinely have calm thoughts of death? What happens when you just need an immediate way out and you can't find one? I don't want to die in pain or fail at dying, but I don't want to be a part of this world anymore. I've tried therapy and suicide hotlines. I've tried talking, I've asked so many people how they cope- the common theme? nobody copes, they just keep going for no reason. 

I have purpose, a hobby I love. Amazing friends, amazing boyfriend and supportive family. I have a degree and potential for a promising future. I have 2 beautiful cats. It's all so fleeting, we all die anyway, I don't know why I have to stay.

I hate this planet so much I don't want to be here anymore and I can't get out, I don't know why I'm alive. I feel like I've gone past my expiration date. I'm not like everyone else. I struggle and panic with the most basic of things, I get all muddled and confused. I'm constantly embarrassed and depressed. I hate having a human form, I don't feel connected to what I see in the mirror. I don't want all the things a future might contain. 

I don't want to be an adult. I don't want the responsibility of living a life and paying bills. It's too much to bare. I want to lay down and go somewhere else. I want death to take me somewhere else. I don't know if i want to be a person or a soul at all.

Nothing feels good anymore. Nothing makes me truly happy, now that summers gone every day is just rain and darkness and more misery- the pandemic is msking everything more and more bleak. I don't want to watch all my friends descend into parenthood, I don't want to keep going, why is a life so important when there are millions of lives better than mine. Why do I have to care. I don't want to contribute to society, I fucking hate society I want to get out of it all now. 

All I have ever wanted, is to be creative and just enjoy nature. I only feel happy when I'm enjoying small things like the sky or the sea, or sitting by a fire or listening to a thunder storm. I don't get to do any of these things enough because life takes its toll and society steals all your time and money away from you. I don't want this anymore. I just want to fall asleep. I just want to stay asleep. I'm in so much pain all the time.

It's not irrational, I'm not hysterical, I'm calm, I'm collected. I want to sleep and never wake up. I hate this horrible world.

To anyone who’s made an attempt...,"What does the sensation of cutting your wrists feel like? I’ve tried to stay positive through this year, 2020 sucks, man. I built up my love life only to be met with the disillusion of having to let everything go, I help my boss when she needs it and then she fucks me over so she doesn’t look bad (I hate Puerto Rican’s, they’re all ingrate, slimey cunts). I’m so tired of it. Of everything. 
I used to journal. Been journaling since 7th grade, but that doesn’t even relieve me anymore. Nothing brings me joy, nothing sparks my interest. I feel like squidward during that episode where he was sad and going through the motions.

Hanging in peace,"I was planning to do it for so long, gave myself a ""due date"" and so earlier I picked up the rope, tied it to my door the way I've been studying it and just...let myself hang there. I could feel myself get a little numb, a lot dizzy but also a sense of peace. 

That's the peace I've been looking for for years and it was right there wrapped suffocatingly around my neck.

Then I heard my cat on the other side of the door and couldn't do it. Nobody understand it and they're all very upset when I say this but...I don't push myself to live to spare my boyfriend or my mom some heartbreak. I love them all but they don't need me.

Things to remember before going,"With each day that goes by, I feel ever slightly less afraid of dying and leaving what's here in this life behind. With each passing sunrise comes another day that I'm emboldened by the idea of leaving this pain behind and embracing the dark and cold.

But before that can happen there's many important things to wrap up and conclude. I need some advice on what these things should include. Obviously some high priority ones include things like:

Notarising a will to pass along monetary and physical property that was yours. 

Closing bank accounts. 

Quitting your job. 

Disposing or selling of unwanted goods.

Terminating all online accounts and emails. 

Etc. 

Any other suggestions to fill in the empty spaces of what a person leaves behind after passing would be deeply appreciated.

I can’t deal with no sleep anymore.,"I can’t deal with no sleep anymore. Like I sleep for 2-3 hours max then wake up after some stupid nightmare and can’t get back to sleep. And lack of sleep is *really* taking its toll now.

Some of these nightmares don’t even make sense. A new reoccurring one I’ve started having is the nightmare that I’m trying to fall asleep, so when I wake up it feels like I haven’t slept at all.

I tried stopping meds as I thought that was causing nightmares, it’s been two weeks and that obviously wasn’t it. I do all the stupid sleep hygiene stuff I’m told to do (no phones or cigarettes before bed, baths, hot drinks, sleeping pills, aromatherapy, reading, meditation music) - nothing works.

I’ve tried talking about the nightmares, not going straight back to sleep, going straight back to sleep, writing them down. Nothing works.

I tried increasing my work hours, because I knew that was stressing me out and adding to the guilt, so I tried to eliminate that stress. Also I was hoping that work would tire me out, which it does, but for whatever reason I still don’t sleep, so now I’m just mentally *and* physically exhausted. 

I’ve spoken to professionals about it, they recommend the sleep hygiene stuff. I tell them I’ve tried it, they say “you’re probably under a lot of stress” - no shit. I’m literally having 24 hour battles with myself trying to convince my brain that we shouldn’t go hang ourselves.

But now shit is getting scary, because the nightmares are happening as soon as I go to sleep, not a few hours in. So now we’re down to 1-3 hours before I wake up, and it’s taking its toll. 

I struggle to speak aloud during the day, I’m forgetting words for everyday items, I’m struggling to concentrate. At work I’m usually able to bounce around and put on this front for a few hours, even when things were at their peak. But now I can’t even keep that up. I’m getting snappy, I’m getting so fucking weak. I keep seeing shit when I’m trying to sleep which I know is just exhaustion, but it’s really scary.

And the thoughts are 10x worse now, which I know isn’t helped by the fact I can’t sleep. It’s not that I don’t want to sleep, I’m absolutely *desperate* for sleep. Pills don’t work. Nothing works. I’m at the point where I know what’s going to happen - and I’m pretty sure I don’t even want it to now. I’m not calm at the thought of dying now, I’m *terrified* by it. Because I remember what this is like, getting to the point where I’m calm/numb and just go welp, time to go.

Because it’s getting to that again. And I know it’s not helped by the fact I can’t sleep. I’ve tried going back on meds, but I’m not hopeful. I can’t remember the last time I was this exhausted. 

Yesterday I spent the entire day zoned out sat on my bed. I didn’t even do anything, because I didn’t have the energy, but I couldn’t sleep. So I just sat dazed for the entire day, other than a few breaks to have a cry at how tired I was, and to go for a walk with my other half so I didn’t try kill myself.

I know this is getting to a peak again soon, and this time I actually don’t have the energy to do anything about it, nor do I want to. I don’t want to die anymore, but I also *can’t* live like this. 

Exhaustion is a fucking killer in itself, man. My brain does and says stuff I didn’t even think it could, and I don’t have the energy to argue with it anymore, because I’m physically and mentally exhausted.

I just want this over with. I just hope it’s not scary. Because at the minute I feel like I’m on autopilot and can’t do anything about it, and I’m really *really* scared.",coffeeandacatfish,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jh1yd3/i_cant_deal_with_no_sleep_anymore/,deal sleep anymore like sleep 2 3 hour max wake stupid nightmare get back sleep lack sleep really taking toll nightmare even make sense new reoccurring one started nightmare trying fall asleep wake feel like slept tried stopping med thought wa causing nightmare two week obviously stupid sleep hygiene stuff told phone cigarette bed bath hot drink sleeping pill aromatherapy reading meditation music nothing work tried talking nightmare going straight back sleep going straight back sleep writing nothing work tried increasing work hour knew wa stressing adding guilt tried eliminate stress also wa hoping work would tire doe whatever reason still sleep mentally physically exhausted spoken professional recommend sleep hygiene stuff tell tried say probably lot stress shit literally 24 hour battle trying convince brain go hang shit getting scary nightmare happening soon go sleep hour 1 3 hour wake taking toll struggle speak aloud day forgetting word everyday item struggling concentrate work usually able bounce around put front hour even thing peak even keep getting snappy getting fucking weak keep seeing shit trying sleep know exhaustion really scary thought 10x worse know helped fact sleep want sleep absolutely desperate sleep pill work nothing work point know going happen pretty sure even want calm thought dying terrified remember like getting point calm numb go welp time go getting know helped fact sleep tried going back med hopeful remember last time wa exhausted yesterday spent entire day zoned sat bed even anything energy sleep sat dazed entire day break cry tired wa go walk half try kill know getting peak soon time actually energy anything want want die anymore also live like exhaustion fucking killer man brain doe say stuff even think could energy argue anymore physically mentally exhausted want hope scary minute feel like autopilot anything really really scared,deal sleep anymore,coffee catfish,3574,35,coffee catfish deal sleep anymore like sleep 2 3 hour max wake stupid nightmare get back sleep lack sleep really taking toll nightmare even make sense new reoccurring one started nightmare trying fall asleep wake feel like slept tried stopping med thought wa causing nightmare two week obviously stupid sleep hygiene stuff told phone cigarette bed bath hot drink sleeping pill aromatherapy reading meditation music nothing work tried talking nightmare going straight back sleep going straight back sleep writing nothing work tried increasing work hour knew wa stressing adding guilt tried eliminate stress also wa hoping work would tire doe whatever reason still sleep mentally physically exhausted spoken professional recommend sleep hygiene stuff tell tried say probably lot stress shit literally 24 hour battle trying convince brain go hang shit getting scary nightmare happening soon go sleep hour 1 3 hour wake taking toll struggle speak aloud day forgetting word everyday item struggling concentrate work usually able bounce around put front hour even thing peak even keep getting snappy getting fucking weak keep seeing shit trying sleep know exhaustion really scary thought 10x worse know helped fact sleep want sleep absolutely desperate sleep pill work nothing work point know going happen pretty sure even want calm thought dying terrified remember like getting point calm numb go welp time go getting know helped fact sleep tried going back med hopeful remember last time wa exhausted yesterday spent entire day zoned sat bed even anything energy sleep sat dazed entire day break cry tired wa go walk half try kill know getting peak soon time actually energy anything want want die anymore also live like exhaustion fucking killer man brain doe say stuff even think could energy argue anymore physically mentally exhausted want hope scary minute feel like autopilot anything really really scared deal sleep anymore

I haven’t felt like anyone has really love/care about me, my dad is on cocaine/crack, he doesn’t do anything for me, I feel alone. I hate being alive nothing has gone good for me. No friends. The only thing I do all day is lay in my bed or sit around on my phone trying to pass time all day. It’s almost like prison but instead of bars in real life, the bars are in my head. I already have my suicide planned, I have about 4 years before I am 21, if by then I feel my life is still shitty and has no meaning I will shoot myself if I need to I will do it before then. I hate how I look every time I look in the mirror I get depressed, I have saggy man tits from losing a lot of weight, only 16. I’m short, when I think of myself i wonder why I had to be born. Another thing is I got fucked up crooked ass teeth, i have a hard time articulating my thoughts. I have bad social anxiety When I went to public school I was always quiet because of the teeth, when I did talk most didn’t listen, this just made me hate myself more. I have constant comparisons in my mind with people because I always feel inferior. I always question past decisions.

"Why is it all so hard, can I just cease to exist?","Everything’s so overwhelming or doesn’t feel like anything at all and I just want it to end. I know I don’t have it as hard as a lot of the people on this sub and that I’m really immensely lucky to have loving parents and financial stability (although this also makes me so fucking worried because I don’t know how i’ll be able to get a high paying job after college with how absolutely depressed and mediocre I am), but each day just feels like the same thing over and over again. It’s just a cycle of forcing myself to get out of bed to doing work and feeling so lethargic and drained to sleeping again. Is this all there is to my existence???? I’m 21 and I’ve never even been in a relationship before and honestly it just attests to the fact that i’m unlovable outside of my biological relationships. I’m not even horrendously ugly or illiterate, just unlovable. My friends are just... they say that they’re there for me but always hang out without me. And I can’t even bring myself to reach out because I don’t want my depression to linger on anyone else. There’s literally no meaning to life if I can’t have a net positive so why can’t I just move on? I can’t even kms because I know my parents will be so heartbroken and I feel so guilty for hating my life and being the way I am. But fucking hell do I want it to end. Sometimes (okay actually a lot of the time) I wish I had some terminal illness or cancer so I’d be able to pass without hurting my parents that much. 

I wish euthanasia was legal and that suicidal people were validated more often too. It sucks to see so many other hurting people only being able speak on here. It sucks to see everyone struggling with even performing the act and it sucks to see people suffering even more after failed attempts. The world is a cruel place, but only to some. I guess that applies here.

Now I'm failing and it's humiliating my family, who take great pride in my academic accomplishments (which I did for them, not me), and make sure to brag about me to every person or news paper outlet that will listen.  For my entire academic career I've had a 4.0, and now I'm below a 2.5, which is the threshold for my scholarship.  It is very likely that I will lose it by the end of this semester.  Not only will my family be embarrassed by me, but I suspect my boyfriend's family will not want to associate with me either once they hear about it, since they also value grades very highly (my boyfriend's a 4.0 student, like I used to be).

I haven't told anyone this, and I guess that's why I'm writing it here.  I don't know if I'm looking for advice or anything; I think maybe I'm just trying to vent.",[deleted],0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgtxfo/if_i_fail_this_semester_im_going_to_kill_myself/,anymore already lost passion school long time ago learning remotely making everything worse even want go school first place family expected go disappoint also know go though future without degree either way lose failing humiliating family take great pride academic accomplishment make sure brag every person news paper outlet listen entire academic career 4 0 2 5 threshold scholarship likely lose end semester family embarrassed suspect boyfriend family want associate either hear since also value grade highly boyfriend 4 0 student like used told anyone guess writing know looking advice anything think maybe trying vent,fail semester going kill,deleted,1163,50,deleted anymore already lost passion school long time ago learning remotely making everything worse even want go school first place family expected go disappoint also know go though future without degree either way lose failing humiliating family take great pride academic accomplishment make sure brag every person news paper outlet listen entire academic career 4 0 2 5 threshold scholarship likely lose end semester family embarrassed suspect boyfriend family want associate either hear since also value grade highly boyfriend 4 0 student like used told anyone guess writing know looking advice anything think maybe trying vent fail semester going kill
Finally doing it tomorrow,"Or at least, driving and trying muster up the courage to jump again. Been a few years since my last ""attempt"" (chickened out last minute) but I think this time it'll finally happen. My parents are older, I no longer have any friends IRL, my siblings are more self-sufficient than ever - no one truly needs me, at least not for much longer if they do at all. Everyone will survive if I go, but if I stay my suffering will just continue endlessly. I don't see [another good day](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ijdxh) ahead. Just wanted to say thanks for the help you've given me over the years, truly helped me prolong my life...even if it was pointless.  

Not like I've done anything truly good with my life in the past 10 years since my first attempt. Just alienated friends, hurt people that cared about me, and just been a general dick to everyone who ever took the time to get to know me. Wish I could change but I honestly don't see the point.

am i that jaded?,"I think if people want to go they shouldn't be forced to stay alive. This world is a truly terrible place. Only a very few privileged people enjoy the perks and theyre also the ones convincing the rest of us working away an existence where we're just 1 paycheck away, 1 medical emergency away, 1 mental breakdown away, 1 trauma away from abject poverty, misery, and/or addiction. Just so we can support their egregious, grotesquely opulent lifestyles that enable them to commit acts of violence and abuse with no one with the power to stop them. We're simply just a means to an end, a flesh light for the elite to use until we're no longer of use and replaced with our younger, equally naive, powerless and vulnerable kin. We're all lambs being led to a slow slaughter where all the time we exchanged for cash leaves us no time at all but to think of and regret what we missed and are still missing because being a cog never ends, even at the end your still weaponized to continue to punch people down here and esp the 3rd world.

I pray for it every night.  I ask God to end my existence,  I pray a car hits me and kills me. I pray 5 lbs of force applied to a trigger comes my way. I pray something crushes me so instantaneously that I die upon impact. I pray he just ends me so I don't have to do it myself... 

I'm not brave enough. 

Everyday I lose more and more faith in humanity, I lose faith in human connection (funny, because I spent my life dedicated to learning g about it and trying to make those I have with this feel good about themselves) I understand how much of a loser I am and how insignificant I am and worthless.

"Long term sufferers of depression, OCD, and PTSD who have tried everything.","Most of you are here because you’ve suffered for what seems like an eternity I’m sure, and are close to giving up on life. I understand the urge and have been interested in the philosophy of suicide for a while now. I do believe that suicide can be justified in some situations such as terminal diseases or life long mental illness, but even these come with exceptions. Most who consider suicide do so because they believe nothing will ever get better, and do not feel like living the rest of their life feeling the way they do. This is understandable. However one thing every pro-choice philosopher agrees on is the fact that suicide should always be a last resort. To those of you who who believe you have tried everything, before you make the ultimate decision to end your life, you owe yourself one more try. Ketamine infusions have been shown to have amazing, life changing results. Most can expect to pay anywhere between 800-4000$ for their treatments all said and done. No one wants to die if they have the option to start living a genuinely good life in the near future. If you are at the end of your rope, Why not save up? Why not give it one more shot? These treatments have saved many lives. Those dealing with long term depression, OCD, PTSD, please do yourself a favor and look into this before making the decision. You cannot say you have tried everything until you have tried ketamine infusions, and you can’t justly end your own life until you can say you have tried everything. Just a thought from someone else going through a tough time rn. If you are planning on ending it anytime in the near future, just give it a few more weeks and some doses of ketamine in a controlled, clinical setting. At this point what do you have to lose? Nothing. What do you have to gain?

"I think I might kill myself one day, and that's fine by me","Now that I'm writing this it feels kinda creepy, but what I said; if it wasn't for my thoughts then my life would be pretty much perfect: I have my future well settled, people say I'm handsome, I'm 6'2, for Normie standards I'm muscular, I have good grades, not because I'm passionate, just because it's what I have to do.

I've had a lot of periods in my life when I feel extreme despair, have existential dread, feel that life has no purpose, that working/putting effort in something is meaningless; the last one is especially problematic because the only way I cope with those thoughts is Imagining that all the effort will pay off.

I fought against it for years, but now I accept that I'll never be truly happy and that is kinda comforting.

I touched another kid inappropriately when I was 10,"I once touched someone inappropriately and I want to kill myself. My neighbor used to drop her 3-year-old son over to come play with my 3-year-old sister a few times a week. I was10 at the time. For some background : since I was around 5 , I remember feeling very uncomfortable being a girl, and I wanted more than anything to be a boy (funnily enough now I’m completely fine being a woman and have no gender issues ) but at the time I was confused. One day while my sister was napping, the boy decided he wanted to sit on my lap, while my parents were upstairs working. He was only wearing swimming shorts because it was summer… and I remember being so curious as to what a penis felt like, and what it does because I wanted one too , I couldn’t resist the urge to touch it and play with it. I did this probably 3 times. Years ago when I was 16 , I woke up one morning with the most intense suicidal guilt I’ve ever felt in my life… how could I have touched someone inappropriately?? And fondled him a bit. I was just so curious at the time, but the behavior was disgusting . I also want to clarify, I’m 22 now and I have no feelings for children at all, if anything I find them kind of gross. But I don’t know what possessed me to do this when I was 10. Some days I forgive myself for being young and fucking stupid, others I just want to kill myself because of the guilt of what I did. Is there anyway in which I can get over this? Do I even deserve to live? These feelings of guilt surface every few months or so and I just can't deal with it.

last day here,"I don't know what to do anymore.
I really really want this to be my last day here. I don't know how much longer I can wake up and get through the day and go to sleep to just do it all again. I want so badly to be able to just lay down knowing all my troubles will be gone as I fade away from existance. I would do it now, but I have no idea how. I have pills but they will only work over the space of 2 days and I don't want that kind of drawn out death. I don't really know what else to do. I'm just lying here in the dark at 1am. I can't fall asleep but I don't know what else to do. just typing. hoping someone will listen. I don't know. i don't really have anything worth living for anymore. I'm bad at relationships with people, romantic or platonic. I'm bad at taking care of myself. I'm bad at getting work done. just getting through life. I constantly mess things up and hurt people and honestly the thought of waking up tomorrow makes me nauseous. I've considered suicide many times in the past,, in March and then in July but this is the strongest I've felt about it. the worst part is,,, I'm only 15. I'm supposed to be a child. the past year of my life has been the worst yet. I deal with mental heath issues daily, battling anorexia and anxiety/paranoia. it ruins everything. I can't do basic things. I can't function like a normal person anymore. I know i have a long life ahead of me. i know I can change things and be happier one day but it just seems so far. the pain and fear seems endless. I can't even talk to anyone because in the past people have just laughed at me, or downplayed my issues. it makes me scared that other people will do the same, so I just don't talk to anyone.

It's been the worst day ever.,"I've been thinking about doing it for a year. Had a few bad attempts, but now I think I'm perfectly set-up for it. It's been really shit all alone, without anybody to talk with, I've tried making friends, but they would disappear soon in max a week and I'm tired of this bullshit, all I asked for is somebody I could talk with, but that was too much to ask for, at this point I'm just a useless piece of shit, I don't really want to keep living like this, I just wanted a family who actually cared, not a father who just disappeared 10years ago and thinks I can look at him as one, and a mother who keeps telling me how I never do anything, always just doing nothing even when I do shit then it's wrong and it's kind of shit not going to lie to y'all, it sucks when whatever you do it's never good enough snd it'll never be good enough because you aren't meant to be, it fucking hurts that I'm here doing everything and fuckers just say how I'm not good enough. Hopefully I don't wake up ever because I'm telling y'all that this is the worst thing that could've happened ever. Sadly I'm still here, I can't find joy anymore, it doesn't exist anymore inside me, I can't even fake smile like I used to. I've fucked up and you can say that suicide is for the easy and life is hard bullshit, but I don't really care at this point. By the time you're reading this long ass text I'm not alive so don't waste your time here, go save somebody else, If you can.
I really hate that nobody would ever ask me if I'm fine, not like it really matters because after I say the usual I'm fine or I'm okay then nobody asks back if that's really true. I'm not sure why I'm typing so much of random shit, I guess that's how a last message should be.
I'm sad that I couldn't save anybody, I don't actually care that nobody can save me, because nobody tried ever to do so. I'll just bleed out in the cold, looking at the trees or something lol. Thanks to everyone who ever said hello, or wasted his time talking to me, maybe if you said hi more then I wouldn't be here right now, but people do mistake, I'm one of those mistakes, I shouldn't be here, I wish I didn't fuck up back in the days but now I'm onto it for real. Shoutouts to like nobody really, because nobody cared enough that I wouldn't be here now. Fuck my family especially my parents for always making me feel bad about myself, fuck my brother for always hitting me so hard that I wish I wasn't alive. Nobody to thank really except the people who make music that made me survive for quite a few months, sadly I won't be here for the next Billie song in November but I hope you'll enjoy it. I always liked writing long texts even though I'm not any good at it and sadly I never had time really for this. Why the fuck am I even trying? I should just finish this up real quick then do my things before I don't have the chances.

Your opinion of whether it's time or not,"So I've been depressed all of my adult life and possibly before that as well. I'm 31. My official diagnosis is schizophrenia and bipolar. Schiz started when I was 24. Bipolar has been within the last year I'd say. Ever since I was 18, I thought to myself that I'd never make it to the next year. Did that until I was like 24. When I was in my early twenties, I was hospitalized 4 times for suicide thoughts, 1 mild attempt (cut my arm with a razor blade) and 3 of these times were within a year. I met a couple girls at group therapy and it was a terrible decision because the one caused me to attempt suicide. Now fast forward I'm 31 and I just moved to a new state. I was so hopeful that things would turn around for me with a fresh start. Well there was a girl at my new job that had a huge crush on me and when I didn't do anything about it, she had a guy take a very unflattering picture of me at the urinal and passed it all around town. So now every single person laughs at me both in public and at my job. I sit in my office alone all day every day and work while trying to ignore all the negative talk around me. Then I come home to my basement apartment and spend the night alone. I do this 5 days a week. On the weekends I would go to my parents down the street, but now they are down south for most of the winter so I only have my little brother who works all the time. I think about all the things that have made me depressed 24/7 because I never talk to anyone else. Why should I? They all think I'm a joke and want nothing to do with me. It's been a year since I moved and I have no girlfriend or any friend at all. My career has jped way higher in the last year, but it's not enough to offset the pain I go through every single day.

I've done a bunch of very bad things in my life,"- One time at high school I didn't like some kid so I singled him out and bullied him a bit.
- Outed some guy for being gay by telling it to my friends
- Argued with random people at a concert. One person I jumped against a couple of times and got asked to stop. Second person wanted to move to her friends, but I didn't move out of the way.
- Smoked way too much weed, cigarettes and ate garbage so I'm probably going to die young

Think enough is enough,"I  think I have sorted my plan out . All this time I have felt like this was always my end and yet in the back of my head I always kind of knew that I probably wouldn't do it .. I've always been scared of the finality of it I guess . The what happens after ? What if you just chose to fail early like usual and your future was going to get better ?!  
I don't know .. I have gotten past all those fears I think . Or at least I don't think I give a shit anymore . I called nurse on call to get my plan worked out and make sure that if I did what I was planning then I will definitely die . She said 100% you will kill yourself if you did that . So now I know what I'm doing ..I just have to  find my cat a home or take him back to the shelter somehow ..get the rest of my house packed up and do something about all my crap . I don't know what to do about my cat though . I tried to call the shelter where I got him but they are out as it's a long weekend where I am and they aren't good at answering phone anyways .so then looked at  surrendering him to local shelter or something as I don't have any family or friends . I don't know what to do about this cat . Shit . He has been here a month and is starting to bond with me I think ? He is making me feel so shitty . He deserves a better cat friendly life with an experienced home .  At least I have a couple days to get him out . 
 
I have this really hard pounding fluttering heart and my whole body is vibrating on the inside . I can't connect or recognise my emotions so does anyone know if this is excitement? Or happiness?  I am crying less than usual today now that I feel I have made the decision. Still sadness and goodbye memories tears but I feel different today . I wish I knew what it is . I feel better I think ? Calmer ? Maybe straight headed for the first time in my life . I don't know but I feel like I could be feeling really good like I can go wild and do anything .
 I hope I don't back out . I know myself .I know I am horrible depressed all day everyday . negative about everything . I don't leave my home .. not even my couch to eat or clean .. nothing .Dont have a life . I'm traumatized by my whole horrific life but I know I am lazy and all those things that means I believe I will not be able to do the therapy and all that life long tough work that people do to turn their lives around and get better . I don't see a future ... If I did ,it looks exactly like what I'm living now . Still in so much emotional pain and torment that it feels like it manifests physically in my chest .  This has to be the only way out because I don't know if I will be able to live with myself in 10/20 years of I'm still at square 1 like I am now .",AnalConfettiLover,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgywxf/think_enough_is_enough/,think sorted plan time felt like wa always end yet back head always kind knew probably always scared finality guess happens chose fail early like usual future wa going get better know gotten past fear think least think give shit anymore called nurse call get plan worked make sure wa planning definitely die said 100 kill know find cat home take back shelter somehow get rest house packed something crap know cat though tried call shelter got long weekend good answering phone anyways looked surrendering local shelter something family friend know cat shit ha month starting bond think making feel shitty deserves better cat friendly life experienced home least couple day get really hard pounding fluttering heart whole body vibrating inside connect recognise emotion doe anyone know excitement happiness cry le usual today feel made decision still sadness goodbye memory tear feel different today wish knew feel better think calmer maybe straight headed first time life know feel like could feeling really good like go wild anything hope back know know horrible depressed day everyday negative everything leave home even couch eat clean nothing dont life traumatized whole horrific life know lazy thing mean believe able therapy life long tough work people turn life around get better see future look exactly like living still much emotional pain torment feel like manifest physically chest ha way know able live 10 20 year still square 1 like,think enough enough,anal confetti lover,2710,22,anal confetti lover think sorted plan time felt like wa always end yet back head always kind knew probably always scared finality guess happens chose fail early like usual future wa going get better know gotten past fear think least think give shit anymore called nurse call get plan worked make sure wa planning definitely die said 100 kill know find cat home take back shelter somehow get rest house packed something crap know cat though tried call shelter got long weekend good answering phone anyways looked surrendering local shelter something family friend know cat shit ha month starting bond think making feel shitty deserves better cat friendly life experienced home least couple day get really hard pounding fluttering heart whole body vibrating inside connect recognise emotion doe anyone know excitement happiness cry le usual today feel made decision still sadness goodbye memory tear feel different today wish knew feel better think calmer maybe straight headed first time life know feel like could feeling really good like go wild anything hope back know know horrible depressed day everyday negative everything leave home even couch eat clean nothing dont life traumatized whole horrific life know lazy thing mean believe able therapy life long tough work people turn life around get better see future look exactly like living still much emotional pain torment feel like manifest physically chest ha way know able live 10 20 year still square 1 like think enough enough
Feeling helpless,"Hey yall first time poster, but long time sufferer.

Basically I have suffered with passive ideations since a young child. I never acted on my urges but I acted about 2 weeks ago. Since then I have been to inpatient and got out about a week ago with new meds that helped. I think what helped was being at inpatient and the meds help a bit but I still feel insanely passively suicidal (and know any moment it can become active but I am safe really). I have major anxiety and depression. Before being hospitalized I did not want to leave my room for any reason unless the rest of my family was sleeping. I feel the same way and it is hard to even take a shower, brush my teeth, play video games so I just feel in a rut. I feel like I will never be in a mindset where I do not think about suicide for a day. It is taxing and I do not even know why I am typing this (and feel like im rambling), but a lot of you are not alone. If there is anything you can say that you think will help feel free to.

I don’t know what to do,"I’m so scared. My wife and best friend of 6 years seems to be taking things to a place where we are going to get a divorce.

But the last few weeks have been hell. She says I don’t understand what makes her tick, that I never listen to her needs or treat her more than a good friend. That she had hoped I would be the one to value her. Even if I try my hardest, I feel like I only do things wrong. We rarely have sex.

Do I tell my parents,"Hey everyone, some info about me: I’m a guy 27 yo, just finished med school in summer ( during these 6 years my mental health deteriorated to absolute state of hopelessness). Even during my studies I often contemplated that it might be easier to just die and not go through this stress anymore. Might seem dramatic, but it really destroyed me. I kept clinging to a hope that maybe once I graduate it’ll get better. I started a job 3 weeks ago and im not performing very well, unsure if what’s holding me back is my knowledge or lack of experience ( which is something I know is normal). I have been provided with very little/none training and I feel extremely unprepared to do this kind of responsible job. I’m incredibly stressed, the covid situation is definitely not helping either. Most of the time I’m in subway waiting for the train to arrive I feel like a hollow shell and wonder if it wouldn’t be easier to just jump than keep going through this. I used to have suicidal thoughts quite often but it’s always been within the reigns of (I would never do this to my family), but lately I feel it swaying away from this barrier. So my question is, do I tell my parents how much I’m struggling? I don’t want them to worry, because I know they’ll be beyond themselves. But at the same time I don’t want them to regret that I never spoke up in the event that I do something stupid (I’m not that low yet, but at this point I can’t say it’s impossible).

TLDR: I’m struggling badly, do I tell my parents who’ll worry A LOT, or try to handle it myself- tell friends only.

I don’t know.,"I’ve been thinking a lot about it lately. Honestly, the main thing holding me back from doing it is my mom. More specifically, the pain she will endure if I did go through with it. I can’t help myself but to think this is the only way, regardless of how much I would love to believe otherwise. I am a very secretive person, I do not speak about my problems to anyone at all. I hate feeling like a charity case, and especially to feel like someone is “feeling sorry” for me. I know that everybody goes through shit, I understand that we all have problems. I don’t want to mention what my problems are, but trust me it has been taking a toll on me for a very long time. I’ve been trying to justify committing suicide to myself, but even in death I don’t want to hurt my mom.

I need help. I can’t do this anymore.,"15f.  

I hate myself. I just don’t like my life at all. I have lots of mental heath problems and stuff. My mum and rest of my family are ok and are nice to me. My dad is / was physically abusive and is a narcasist. 

I have Schizophrenia, Depression, ADHD, Anxiety and Autism. I’m basically fucked up. 

I get called names like crazy, insane, psycho, slut, whore, retard, emo (referencing to self harming).

Today at school i got told 3 things by “friends”: 

“You don’t have depression because you’re not depressed now” also, “kill yourself” and one of my friends made a joke about self harming, not knowing i do it until one of my friends said i did. 

I’m an idiot. I stopped taking my meds, I’m not eating properly, and i keep getting told off at school for not doing much work at all but they don’t understand ADHD and how it makes it hard and stuff. I’m alot slower than most and i have too much energy for most. Idk what to do. 

I’m fucked up. In school i have people who are nice and i can go and see them and we talk and stuff and there is a room with stuff to mess around with, whilst making work fun at the same time and it makes it easier because i can go at my own pace. I hate going to school because i don’t like people anymore. My teachers are noticing i’m seeming depressed and sad all of the time and stuff and ask me if i’m ok but i’m really not. 

I have tried therapy and they just tried to give me more meds. I couldn’t even talk well because i just kept crying and stuff. 

I had an anxiety attack and stuff when my Schizophrenia started to mess around with my head and i basically fainted in the medical room. I woke up in hospital a few days ago when it happened and the nurse said she saw my scars on my thighs and knees and should she tell anyone. I said to please not to but She was really nice and took care of me and stuff and helped me when i got sad and things. She also liked to colour and coloured with me which was cool. 

I am out now but i haven’t been to school and i’m scared to go back. I don’t like myself at all now and i keep on being sad and getting dragged down and crying all of the time. I just want to take alot of my meds all at once and just hope for the worst.

I'm trying to write my two goddaughters a letter they can read after they've grown up some more.,"I will end my life tonight but I feel especially bad for those two little balls of love.

It's just really hard, I want to leave something that matters to them. There's so much to say but I don't know what I should focus on, they might even resent me and just burn the letters but that's their own valid choice.

I just want to somehow summarize everything they mean to me and tell something about myself, how I'm so sorry that I failed them and everyone else.

I want to pour my heart and soul into these two letters but I'm afraid of saying something stupid/worthless or accidentally leaving something important unsaid.

So please, answer honestly. What would you've wanted to hear from a deceased person that wrote a letter specifically for you?

Edit: finished the letters, it's my time to go now. Thanks and goodbye, spread the love and positivity around you if you're able to.

Peace ✌️❤️

"My last living parent acknowledges how suicidal their child is in jokes, doesn't even care.","All these years I thought my dad didnt understand depression as he has a very boomer-esque ""be a man and get over it"" mindset but he's recently mentioned, both in jokes about how suicidal I am. I was blown away. I knew he was fucked up he's an alcoholic among a slew of other issues and he's very selfish but this really opened my eyes. First was a joke about someone we knew being crazy and he said ""no not like you, not wanting to kill yourself"" and then the other day in regards to a author who committed suicide he said ""you should know all about that"".

I have to say, It's...there is no type of word for the realization your only living parent really just doesnt care that you are suicidal. I could ""understand"" that he wasnt empathetic towards depression since he thinks you can turn it on and off but imagine you knew your own child wanted to kill themselves and you were just fine with it?

Need advice for a friend and I,"Hey Reddit,

I met this beautiful girl over a dating app. We've been talking every day for almost three months now, and we started dating. Everything is going great, I'm really into this girl. She makes me laugh a lot, she's smart, she's super cute, and she's kind. We have a lot of similarities, and we're the same ethnicity, which only made us connect more because of our similar culture. Basically, the ideal girl for me. We go on a few dates, everything is awesome. We joke about our future together. I'm not in love yet, but I could be. I'm invested in this girl. I couldn't be happier, and she feels just as happy as I am.

Or so I thought

I knew she had problems at home; her disconnection with her parents was evident. To sum it up, her father is manipulative, abusive, (not physically), etc. And I guess her mother favors her sisters over her and disregards her feelings entirely. So she doesn't feel loved by her parents or simply isn't. But she has everything; she's a teeny bit spoiled and she knows it. But as she's said, she just wants love from her parents and their validation. I guess that's a horrible way to feel for your entire life. I would probably feel the same.

&amp;#x200B;

So, fast forward to last Friday. We go on a date, everything is awesome, and I feel in love. The following day, she told me she had an appointment with her therapist. I didn't judge, that's fine. It's extra support if you need it. But for the next few days, she barely spoke to me. She just told me we needed to talk, but continued to delay it. She wasn't texting a lot and was really brief and lacking emotion. This wasn't like her at all. She was such an energetic and happy person. So I'm over here thinking, ""what the fuck, she wants to break up?? why?? and why is she delaying it?"". It was on Wednesday that we finally spoke.

She told me her therapist had diagnosed her with dysthymia, or persistent depressive disorder, and I believe she was also deemed suicidal. Her therapist also recommended her self-admit, stating that her case isn't severe enough for him to admit her. This came as a shock to me. She had told me before that she had attempted suicide, etc, and I did think it was a yellow flag, but I didn't think it was this bad. But then again, everyone always thinks that.

We've been talking since, but everything is different. I feel like I'm talking to a completely different person, not the person I once knew. Regardless, I'm offering my support, I want to be at her side. I know she doesn't have anyone else to help. She tells me how she feels, how she thinks about suicide often, how she's numb, how she doesn't want to live. I mean, fuck. That's pretty disheartening to hear, especially from someone you thought felt the complete opposite. I offer my support, and I'm really trying to help; I'll text her often, treating her normally, but I get unenergetic responses. I can almost feel what she's going through. 

Now, she's asking me to leave her. She doesn't want me to ""see her unravel"", nor does she want to bring me down with her or impact me negatively. Imagine how you would feel if someone said this shit to you. It's horrible. But I don't want to leave her; I am here for her. 

I'm afraid to leave her. I feel that if I do leave, she'll have no one else, and she just might do it. She keeps telling me she doesn't want to die yet, and that I shouldn't worry about her. But that in it of itself is pretty fucking worrisome, no? 

So what are my options? Stay with her, possibly bring me down with her (slightly inevitable, my thoughts have already revolved around her since she told me her feelings). Or, I leave her. But I don't want to leave her. I mean, what's the point of a relationship if I can't stay and help even in the hard times? I thought about contacting her sister via social media, and just establishing a connection with the sister so that if anything starts heading in the wrong direction, I have a family member I can contact, but I don't know if I would be in the wrong to do that. 

I really like this girl. I know I'd be devastated if she killed herself. 

She keeps telling me that I need to forget about her and move on.

What I'm thinking, is that I still have enough leeway to try and convince her to hang out with me one last time. I could talk to her then, try and see how she's doing. But ultimately, I think the goal will be to get her to self-admit, no? I might be able to do that if I can convince her that I'll leave her if she can self-admit. 

If I leave her, she'll have nobody else, and she probably won't have a reason to live.

&amp;#x200B;

Tried to kill myself last week,"But I obviously failed. I had a very difficult conversation with my mum where she told me that I’m nothing but a burden and that she can’t deal with my presence (I came back home from college because of covid) amongst many other hurtful things. I kinda lost it after that and dissociated. I usually end up hurting myself whenever I’m dissociating and this time, I managed to slit my wrists. I was bleeding everywhere so I called for help (I’m not actively suicidal) and my brother gave me some bandages while my parents yelled at me for being an asshole. I had a panic attack and my body was seizing etc so they left me alone since they couldn’t scream at me anymore. My dad would come berate me for ruining everyone’s weekend every now and then but no one else bothered with me for the rest of the day. It’s been a few days and everyone acts like nothing happened with their usual behaviour of pretending like I don’t have any mental illness or history of suicide attempts.

Suicidal ideation but don’t want to go to a hospital,I feel so bad sometimes... I’ve stopped functioning like an adult. Many days I lay in bed sleeping when I should be working and taking care or myself but I’m able to pretend I’m okay to anyone that would care. I beat myself up for being lazy but know it’s depression. I’ve been through a lot. I don’t think I am going to kill myself soon but know it’s a high risk for a lot of reasons and I keep thinking about it. I am afraid to tell my friends or anyone who could help because I don’t want it to seem like it’s a cry for attention and if I really intend to do it then I shouldn’t tell anyone because then they will try to stop me. I was in a mental hospital earlier this year and it made me feel even worse because I couldn’t pretend anymore but I feel bad even posting that because I would never want to discourage anyone else from seeking help. I feel like I’m confused and sort of a fraud even when I have these serious issues of trying to deal with  trauma like nightmares and recurring thoughts then contemplating how I should end my life.

My mother didn't realize I was in the room when she was talking about me.,"So I was in the living room, blankets all over me so I guess that's why she didn't see me. But I didn't realize that at first as I was on my phone. My father called my mother and they were talking about some unnecessary things as always. Then they switched the topic to me and that's when it started.

My mother told my father that she absolutely can't stand me anymore. I behave like a 10 year old, asking her for hugs and not wanting to be alone in my room because I'm so lonely. 
I quickly realized that she didn't know I was in the room but I didn't say anything as I wanted to know what more she woul say. Big mistake.

She then went on to tell him that I always threaten her by saying that I don't want to live anymore. (I do this because I have noone else to tell this to and it kills me, ABSOLUTELY kills me when I can't talk to someone about this)
She tells him that she just wished I would kill myself so she wouldn't have to listen to my stupid ugly voice anymore.

(I have an unusually deep voice for being female and my ex-bestfriends always were shaming me for it)

She then started to cry and was really aggressively telling my father all the ways she wanted to see me dead. 

I should be hanging in my room from the ceiling.

I should be a mess of blood splattered on the ground after being driven over by a car or train.

I should be lying in my bed dead after having taken thousands of pills.

I'm going to spare you more details but she was very, very aggressively detailed about telling my father the ways in which I should die. 

My father, I guess, agreed to her or didn't try to stop her atleast. He hates me a lot. (He abused me for over 10 years)

At that point I felt the panic attack coming and didn't hear what else she was saying. She hung up soon after that.

I sat there for a couple of minutes, afraid what she would do to me when she found out, I heard her. I then quickly ran out of the room, up the stairs and smashed my door shut and put my chair infront of the door because I could already hear her screaming.

I'm absolutely terrified. I'm broken. I thought she was the only one I could trust and talk to (even though I knew she hated me from the way she always talked to me before) but now it's real. This is reality. This really just happened. Help me please. I want to kill myself so bad. I am suicidal again since 3 weeks and this week has been going ok, I thought I could finally go back to school again and forget about suicide but this just shattered me.

I had friends who abandoned me for being suicidal. And now my mother, the only person I could trust said this about me behind my back. I have noone. I want to die. Please help me. Please.

EDIT: I don't know if anyone will read this but I just wanted to let you know that I'm still here. I don't know if I will get through this day because it's getting worse as time goes on. The real reason I wanted to edit my post is to say thank you for all you amazingly kind people out there. I didn't think so many people would see my post and I also don't understand how or why but thank you all for your kind words. I love everyone of you, no matter if you commented or not. If someone ever needs help please write me! I think we should all support each other and I'd so love to support you. There have also been some people and I know they only want to help that told me I should kill my parents instead of killing myself. I just wanted to say that I appreciate you trying to help me but I would never be able to do that. The only person I could do something to is myself and I don't think that will ever change. I would comment on every single one of your responses but there's so many and I'm not sure if everyone would want an answer from me in their inbox but just know that I read every one of your comments!

I can't remember the feeling of happiness after having not felt true happiness for years.,"My story i guess or a vent or something idk idc

Im not sure when it all began but for many years i have wanted to kill myself just end it all. I feel so lonely all the time. I have planned and attempted to kill myself before but either pussied out or something went wrong. When i sleep i feel at peace and in those rare occasions i have dreams i am happy, but then i wake up and realize i can never be that happy and every single day i wake up i wish i hadn't i wish i would have just died in my sleep.   
A few years ago or just 1 im not sure a thing happened which like made me feel even more suicidal and then a few months after that another thing happened and that day i went to a mountain planning to jump off but people were walking with there dogs there and i don't want those dogs to see that.  
Simular events happened over and over and then for like the past 2 months the only person i really talked to stopped talking to me. I get her tho i wouldn't talk to a fucking monster like me.  
The past 2 months or so i have just been getting worse and worse as the days go by. I moved to the city thinking my life would be different i could idk meet new people or something go out and live a little.  
But that didn't happen, i relapsed into hurting myself after the person stopped talking to me. I don't cut my arms tho since that is too noticeable, i don't eat for couple days or a week then i burn my hands and scratch and cut my back.  
For a long time i tried pouring myself into work and art to try to think of something else then what is in my head all the time and it worked, for some time. While i was drawing i didn't think of anything else but then after the drawings everything came back, until eventually i came to hate it and destroyed my left hand (i am a lefty) lived near some cliffs and smashed it with rocks and well now i don't feel anything in 2 of my fingers and it shakes a lot.

I am not afraid of dying i came to peace with death a long time ago in fact i would embrace it but then there is always someone there and i know that if i would let myself just drop in the ocean then they would just pull me out.   
It's easy to pretend to be happy so as far as people know im doing fine but in reality not a second passes with out me thinking about ending it all.

For some time i thought that if i couldn't make myself happy then perhaps someone else could, so i had some hopes of that i could be in a relationship or something but then i realized that that is nothing but USELESS HOPE. If i can't make myself happy then why the FUCK should someone else be able to do so, I DON'T DESERVE IT. Someone like me shouldn't be happy and its obvious that no one gives a shit since if they did i wouldn't be alone all the time. 

I just want to know why, why does everyone hate me so much. WHY DO I HATE MYSELF THIS MUCH.  
I just wanted to be happy in life.

But i have decided that next Summer or perhaps rather Easter if i still feel like this then i am going to kill myself. Not gonna care if someone is on the mountain that i plan to jump of just gonna do it.",Dinosherif,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgurhn/i_cant_remember_the_feeling_of_happiness_after/,story guess vent something idk idc im sure began many year wanted kill end feel lonely time planned attempted kill either pussied something went wrong sleep feel peace rare occasion dream happy wake realize never happy every single day wake wish wish would died sleep year ago 1 im sure thing happened like made feel even suicidal month another thing happened day went mountain planning jump people walking dog want dog see simular event happened like past 2 month person really talked stopped talking get tho talk fucking monster like past 2 month getting worse worse day go moved city thinking life would different could idk meet new people something go live little happen relapsed hurting person stopped talking cut arm tho since noticeable eat couple day week burn hand scratch cut back long time tried pouring work art try think something else head time worked time wa drawing think anything else drawing everything came back eventually came hate destroyed left hand lefty lived near cliff smashed rock well feel anything 2 finger shake lot afraid dying came peace death long time ago fact would embrace always someone know would let drop ocean would pull easy pretend happy far people know im fine reality second pass thinking ending time thought make happy perhaps someone else could hope could relationship something realized nothing useless hope make happy fuck someone else able deserve someone like happy obvious one give shit since alone time want know doe everyone hate much hate much wanted happy life decided next summer perhaps rather easter still feel like going kill gonna care someone mountain plan jump gonna,remember feeling happiness felt true happiness year,dinos,3083,89,dinos story guess vent something idk idc im sure began many year wanted kill end feel lonely time planned attempted kill either pussied something went wrong sleep feel peace rare occasion dream happy wake realize never happy every single day wake wish wish would died sleep year ago 1 im sure thing happened like made feel even suicidal month another thing happened day went mountain planning jump people walking dog want dog see simular event happened like past 2 month person really talked stopped talking get tho talk fucking monster like past 2 month getting worse worse day go moved city thinking life would different could idk meet new people something go live little happen relapsed hurting person stopped talking cut arm tho since noticeable eat couple day week burn hand scratch cut back long time tried pouring work art try think something else head time worked time wa drawing think anything else drawing everything came back eventually came hate destroyed left hand lefty lived near cliff smashed rock well feel anything 2 finger shake lot afraid dying came peace death long time ago fact would embrace always someone know would let drop ocean would pull easy pretend happy far people know im fine reality second pass thinking ending time thought make happy perhaps someone else could hope could relationship something realized nothing useless hope make happy fuck someone else able deserve someone like happy obvious one give shit since alone time want know doe everyone hate much hate much wanted happy life decided next summer perhaps rather easter still feel like going kill gonna care someone mountain plan jump gonna remember feeling happiness felt true happiness year

Crying and Confused from Kindness?,"I still want to die, nothing has changed with that in over 25 years from my first thoughts of suicide and self harm.

But I guess my mental condition has gotten especially weird now as I’m crying because someone was kind to me.

A guy I have only spoken with a couple times online purchased an amazon gift card for me for my birthday even though my birthday happened weeks before we talked. He doesn’t know anything about my personal life really. I’ve intentionally tried to be on my most normal behavior in the hope maybe I’ll have someone to talk to. The loneliness is deafening.

But he sent a $20 card to my e-mail with a kind message.

I haven’t received so much as a gift or a card from someone in many many years. I don’t even remember how long it’s been... 5 years? Longer? Maybe 7? They all run together after a while. I stopped counting or ever expecting that again.

I found myself so moved I started sobbing.

Not wanting to frighten him I said thank you over text.

I hate hiding my emotions but I’ve found it’s usually for the best.

The crying was bittersweet.

It was nice that someone would think of me, that’s moving. But it also made me sad that for so many years no one has.

As I know it was just a small token from essentially a stranger, I was privately embarrassed, surprised, and ashamed by my reaction to it.

It also made me feel odd because I do have so much trauma, and this person doesn’t know me really.

So then it’s like my brain starts going “ Does this gift mean anything at all? Why are you so emotional? It probably means nothing to them and they’d probably think you were weird for it affecting you.”

I both appreciate it but sort of wish they hadn’t sent it because it made me feel emotionally noticed and it scared me because I always have to brace for the ensuing rejection if they start asking about my trauma, hospitalizations, suicide attempts, family etc.

I’ve tried so hard to appear “normal” it’s like anything unexpected and I’m falling apart.

I don’t know how to feel about it.

A part of me wants to pull away.

Why am I so messed up I can’t just enjoy this?

I was supposed to be the successful child,"Hi everyone, 
I’m literally laying in my bed in tears as I type this. Basically, my parents had me very young and ended up getting degrees later in life. Their goal for me was to get it on time. For the past four years it looked like I was going to be able to do it but I failed my last class and basically disappointed everyone and set my graduation back. The goal was to retake the class and pass but as the semester has gone by the odds of that keep dropping. I can’t pass the class because I’m not smart enough and I don’t know what to do. Everyone’s going to say I didn’t try but I did, sometimes I’ll spend hours in my room  just trying to get it. Having it online is not helping and I pretty much have to calm myself down before every exam.

I’ve always had thoughts of suicide growing up and even attempted once when I was younger but I ended up just throwing up (not very successful). I just don’t know what to do now. My family is super judge mental and I don’t think I can take being a failure. 

Part of me wants to graduate to please my mom but the other part of me just wants to quit. I’m currently living with her as I try to finish but everyday I feel like a burden. I know my stepdad is getting annoyed with me being there and honestly I just want to get away from everyone. I’ve been trying to get a job so that I can move out and figure things out on my own but I’m not getting any calls back. Having to fake like I’m okay is getting to be too much. I’ve been lying to my only friend about how everything is going and I thought about to just being honest with her but then decided not to so I don’t add my problems onto hers.

For the past week, my mind has been thinking about just ending everything. I feel like everyone would eventually get over it and then they won’t have to see me as a failure. I’m fat, I’m ugly, I’m dumb, and I don’t know what I’m living for anymore.

I don’t have anyone to talk to about things like this and it’s hard. I love my mother but she’s not very empathetic and thinks people should just get over things. But it’s not that easy for me. I tried getting into religion thinking that would help me but it hasn’t.

I haven’t properly combed my hair in a month. I stopped showering regularly. I don’t call people as much as I used. When I first started college, I had a drive to improve my life, that’s gone. Teeth don’t get brushed regularly. I’ve gained 20lbs. I’m falling apart. I want help, I just don’t know how to ask the people in my life for it,

I have hobbies that I love, interests I love, life doesn't feel like a drag in the slightest. I'm happy. Like, I have it really good right now. But I really hope that in three to four years I have the courage to hang myself.

The world is getting *worse.* Like, holy shit, this world is getting so much worse for the working class and it's a little mind boggling. I despise this country. I hate it so much. I fucking despise everything about America and every single capitalist lie that gets shoved down people's throats, convincing them that working 60 hours a week just to possibly survive is normal, and justifiable. What a living nightmare we exist in. Currently, the field I'm pursuing only has good jobs in a few cities, and those cities have exorbitantly high cost of living. 2,000+ dollars a month for a small, unfurnished hole in the wall apartment building? And naturally, my field of work regularly has 10 hour days, 60-70 hour work weeks, that's generally the norm. And at first I thought to myself that this was just a unique, shitty feature of my preferred industry, but it really isn't. Everyone has to deal with such bullshit working conditions in order to meet the bare minimum of living, no matter what field. The workdays are meaningless, and they keep getting longer and longer and wages are getting worse and worse. This is affecting EVERYONE. And the younger you are, the worse you're going to have it. College debt will be something I have to deal with for the rest of my life, and for what? I do not want to be ground to dust for the rest of my adult life just so I can lay down for 10 hours a day on the one day per week I have off. Human beings should not have to live like this. It's inhumane, it's disgusting, and some inescapable climate apocalypse is going to bring about hell on Earth, even for wealthier countries.

Is this really *life?* Is this honestly what life is about? Is this what it all adds up to? We have a brief flash of freedom when we're in our teens, then we're driven into the dirt and feel like shit all of our lives. Then we try and tell other people ways we shouldn't feel like shit, even though everyone just feels like shit. Trying to convince ourselves that there's some mythic utopian life we can be living in which your wages can afford you everything you need to live plus savings and some disposable income for fun, and you don't have to work more than 40 hours a week (which, by the way, is completely unnecessary given the dramatic rise in productivity standards). In reality, everything just sucks when you're in the real world, and I honestly don't want to deal with any of that.

I want to live the next three years of my life the best I can, and ever since I convinced myself that I'll be dead in three years, I have felt amazing. I'll try anything I want, I'll take chances whenever I please, and it feels great. I feel so fucking liberated it's amazing. I don't have to deal with the consequences of anything if I don't want to. I just live, doing the best I can and doing whatever I want knowing that I have an easy out when the fun runs dry and life becomes a nightmare. It feels fucked up, but there's something so cathartic about always having a get out of jail free card. It allows me to do whatever I wish, and I don't want this lifestyle I've adopted to go away. I want to live free forever. But I can't. So when my freedom is gone, I'm going to kill myself, and I'll be happy about it. I won't let the world get to me. I'll live and die on my own terms, and I honestly can't see a better way to do it. What is wrong with me? I love myself and my life, but I really wanna kill myself in three years.",alifornian,13,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgi8k4/i_want_to_die_in_three_years/,right thing easy like way thing going friend care care people relate got good family life fun sibling loving mother currently college getting high mark higher grade ever entire life pursuing subject really enjoy hobby love interest love life feel like drag slightest happy like really good right really hope three four year courage hang world getting worse like holy shit world getting much worse working class little mind boggling despise country hate much fucking despise everything america every single capitalist lie get shoved people throat convincing working 60 hour week possibly survive normal justifiable living nightmare exist currently field pursuing ha good job city city exorbitantly high cost living 2 000 dollar month small unfurnished hole wall apartment building naturally field work regularly ha 10 hour day 60 70 hour work week generally norm first thought wa unique shitty feature preferred industry really everyone ha deal bullshit working condition order meet bare minimum living matter field workday meaningless keep getting longer longer wage getting worse worse affecting everyone younger worse going college debt something deal rest life want ground dust rest adult life lay 10 hour day one day per week human live like inhumane disgusting inescapable climate apocalypse going bring hell earth even wealthier country really life honestly life add brief flash freedom teen driven dirt feel like shit life try tell people way feel like shit even though everyone feel like shit trying convince mythic utopian life living wage afford everything need live plus saving disposable income fun work 40 hour week way completely unnecessary given dramatic rise productivity standard reality everything suck real world honestly want deal want live next three year life best ever since convinced dead three year felt amazing try anything want take chance whenever please feel great feel fucking liberated amazing deal consequence anything want live best whatever want knowing easy fun run dry life becomes nightmare feel fucked something cathartic always get jail free card allows whatever wish want lifestyle adopted go away want live free forever freedom gone going kill happy let world get live die term honestly see better way wrong love life really wanna kill three year,want die three year,ali ni,4008,28,ali ni right thing easy like way thing going friend care care people relate got good family life fun sibling loving mother currently college getting high mark higher grade ever entire life pursuing subject really enjoy hobby love interest love life feel like drag slightest happy like really good right really hope three four year courage hang world getting worse like holy shit world getting much worse working class little mind boggling despise country hate much fucking despise everything america every single capitalist lie get shoved people throat convincing working 60 hour week possibly survive normal justifiable living nightmare exist currently field pursuing ha good job city city exorbitantly high cost living 2 000 dollar month small unfurnished hole wall apartment building naturally field work regularly ha 10 hour day 60 70 hour work week generally norm first thought wa unique shitty feature preferred industry really everyone ha deal bullshit working condition order meet bare minimum living matter field workday meaningless keep getting longer longer wage getting worse worse affecting everyone younger worse going college debt something deal rest life want ground dust rest adult life lay 10 hour day one day per week human live like inhumane disgusting inescapable climate apocalypse going bring hell earth even wealthier country really life honestly life add brief flash freedom teen driven dirt feel like shit life try tell people way feel like shit even though everyone feel like shit trying convince mythic utopian life living wage afford everything need live plus saving disposable income fun work 40 hour week way completely unnecessary given dramatic rise productivity standard reality everything suck real world honestly want deal want live next three year life best ever since convinced dead three year felt amazing try anything want take chance whenever please feel great feel fucking liberated amazing deal consequence anything want live best whatever want knowing easy fun run dry life becomes nightmare feel fucked something cathartic always get jail free card allows whatever wish want lifestyle adopted go away want live free forever freedom gone going kill happy let world get live die term honestly see better way wrong love life really wanna kill three year want die three year

And I don't want or need anyone to tell me that my ""childhood is just a small part of my life"", or that I ""shouldn't grieve over something that wasn't my fault"", or anything else like that. I want to grieve my lost years, besides none of those things make me feel better anymore. I never got to experience a normal school life nor a normal family life, but believe it or not those aren't even the main things I lost, I lost so much more than just those things, SO much more, and I cry so fucking hard when I think about that.

Run out of options / about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it,"I’ve hit rock bottom . I’m ready to do it . It’s currently 6 in the morning here in the UK and I’m about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills . 

I’m a 19 year old male university student studying architecture and planning . I’ve suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . 

Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again .

I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven’t told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I’m still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I’ve fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. 

I can’t bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don’t want to do this but I’ve run out of options . 

Furthermore my brothers and my 20th birthday is only in a couple of days , which adds to the pain . I’m so scared I’ve never done anything like this before and I’m so scared of the pain I will cause to my parents and family . 

Thank you for listening and I hope I can get the peace i need .",Studentsilva28,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgh2fc/run_out_of_options_about_to_lock_myself_in_the/,hit rock bottom ready currently 6 morning uk lock bathroom knife pill 19 year old male university student studying architecture planning suffered depression severe anxiety social anxiety quite year never diagnosed seeked help spoken anyone mental breakdown spring 2019 level somehow managed get back foot complete exam one know wa painful time thing going well first year april 2020 coronavirus hit mixture severe anxiety depression stress caused completely overwhelmed hand coursework resulted failing first year retake feel like complete failure everything going well told anyone moved back uni house acted normal uni friend last week still hoping continue second year feel horrible fake act normal put front around everyone knowing fucked everything pretending everything still okay high functioning depression ive learned hide really well perfectionism paralysis trying good act without fault around everyone time overwhelming bear thought retake year end behind friend let alone shame overwhelming thought family finding also future hold ha last straw suicide mind feel awful want run option furthermore brother 20th birthday couple day add pain scared never done anything like scared pain cause parent family thank listening hope get peace need,run option lock bathroom,student silva 28,2144,66,student silva 28 hit rock bottom ready currently 6 morning uk lock bathroom knife pill 19 year old male university student studying architecture planning suffered depression severe anxiety social anxiety quite year never diagnosed seeked help spoken anyone mental breakdown spring 2019 level somehow managed get back foot complete exam one know wa painful time thing going well first year april 2020 coronavirus hit mixture severe anxiety depression stress caused completely overwhelmed hand coursework resulted failing first year retake feel like complete failure everything going well told anyone moved back uni house acted normal uni friend last week still hoping continue second year feel horrible fake act normal put front around everyone knowing fucked everything pretending everything still okay high functioning depression ive learned hide really well perfectionism paralysis trying good act without fault around everyone time overwhelming bear thought retake year end behind friend let alone shame overwhelming thought family finding also future hold ha last straw suicide mind feel awful want run option furthermore brother 20th birthday couple day add pain scared never done anything like scared pain cause parent family thank listening hope get peace need run option lock bathroom
I just don't think I can cope anymore,"So I have dissociative identity disorder, bipolar 1, PTSD, and OCD. All of them have been contributing to this, I just can't do it, I can't cope, nothing I can do makes me feel better or makes me feel okay. I would like to talk to my friends about things I deal with but I know the relief would only be temporary and they probably just simply wouldn't understand. I would say because I am at the end of my rope that I should check myself into somewhere but I can't as there is only place in our entire town and that place has been ridiculed for how bad it is and I can only assume it would make the situation much worse. What i'm trying to say is I guess it all just feels futile, I know nothing I can do right now would do anything. Literally nothing could help and I am legit just unable to get the treatment that I want, I can't see my therapist two times a week even though that would help me because insurance is an ass.  I just feel like there is nothing left and i'm suffering 24/7, not even my dreams, so I feel like i'm left with one option and that's to die. I can't say i'm afraid of dying, really i'm not so I consider this the only option I got left cause nothing else is feasible and maybe it would do me and the world some good if I just dropped like a fly.

I have a girlfriend as well.. she is one of my comforts but it doesn't change how much of a mess I am in. Idk what the point of this post is. But I find myself frequenting gun shops.. I have enough to buy one. But I am trying to hold off for now.. cause once I do there wont be much time left for me. thanks for anyone who reads this..

They won,"My rapist is my uncle who raped me between the ages of 5 years old till 11, just because I told him I want to become a boy, and he raped me multiple times so that my child brain could understand it’s better to be a women because “it feels good”, at the age of 8 years old I was diagnosed with cancer, and even with that he never stopped, to top it all off one of the male nurses saw him, and that male nurse molested me for months.
I never told my parents due to their verbal and physical abused and threatened me at the age of 13 my mother would call me a whore and if I lost my virginity while chocking me against the wall till I pass out, and all I did was go to a near by park to sit on a swing.
She kept abusing me till the mid of my 20’s.
My father mentally abused me in such ways that he kept comparing me to objects and people and how slow and stupid I am. How I look or act for years.
I can never talk to them about what happened to me as a child because they will victim blame, nor would they apologize for what they have done. 
I’m a transgender man in my 20’s who can’t leave home. 
So at home is where I stay and where my grave would be. 
My country doesn’t have a suicide hotline, and everyone looks down upon rape victims and lgbtq plus people.

"I'm on the verge of suicide after weeks of sleep deprivation and lack of meds and overwhelming life changes and being insulted by my therapist and a suicide number hotline. I'm planning to go to the pysch ward next week, I need some advice :(","I'm at my worst state I've been in in years. I can't take care of myself because I'm addicted to my phone and don't sleep until 10am to 5pm, and the lack of sunlight is putting my body in shock. But lately I've been barely sleeping at all. I want to buy some books to bring with me to the pysch ward to keep me busy because I need to be nursed back to health in a safe environment that reinforces healthy body schedules like the hospital.

But my grandpa's funeral service is this Tuesday and burial on Wednesday. I want to pull through long enough to attend that and perform some music for that, and immediately after I'll turn myself in. My family doesn't like me going to the hospital and they're against doctors and shit and think I'm putting myself in trouble while they're the ones responsible for my major depression and post traumatic stress disorder and insomnia.

I want to buy some books off Amazon, one about origami so I can fold some origami, a fiction book that'll keep me happy, and maybe a self help book on depression or managing my emotions.

I also wanna write down a list of funny jokes from r/Jokes to bring with me because everytime I've been to the psych ward the nurses have good laughs with me cuz I'm pretty chill and humorous and not violent towards anyone.

I'm worried my mom won't take good care of my dog even tho she feeds him (very rarely the dog will get out the house cuz of her negligence and I'm the one who always brings him back)  or that my parents will get angry at me for going to the hospital and they might try and stop me, need some advice on that :(

Yearning for death,"I have a very strange situation. i am not depressed or sad, however i wish to die as i see no point in life. The factors stopping me are primarily religion and fear. As far as i can remember as child i always wanted my life to pass by and end as quick as possible. Depression and mental unsuitability is a common behaviour trait within my direct family therefore i believe my desire for death is genetically induced. 
I acknowledge that emotions are all perceptions of my outlook on life and if i can control this i can choose to be happy and choose to avoid certain emotions. I’ve also come to the conclusion that i enjoy the rush and feeling of being upset or alone as this removes my attachment to reality. This philosophy gives me control over my literal emotions allowing me to function without emotions interrupting my daily life unlike other members of my family. 
But despite me having control over my emotions not being depressed or sad i still wish to die like i mention before i cant because i have belief in religion which prohibits me from doing so and the fear of killing my self is far too great.

I rlly wanted to celebrate the end of school! Furthermore, tmr was going to be rlly busy.I felt rlly frustrated and blasted paganini's 24 caprices and also some intense Vivaldi. I messaged my only friends who were from other schools and they were too busy to reply. I felt rlly sad that my only friends couldnt talk now and other ppl who were accessible were my classmates. I remembered how ppl ostracised me in class(eg. usually ignore me, deride me, mock me) and I got rlly mad(I dunno why, doesnt usually happen). I messaged ""fuck u"" to the class grp chat and they laughed at me. I talked abt how they didnt show any care toward me and instead derided and ostracised me, to which they replied that I was ""self centered"" and didnt ""understand ppl"". I then left the chat and punched the wall till my knuckles were red and cried for a few minutes. My brother just stared at me and then pretended nothing happened, and my mother was so busy she didnt notice(she was in the next room working).I hate that ppl are always mean and dont care abt me and how my mom is always too busy.

How can I prove to myself I'm alive?,"I think I'm dead. In hell in fact. How can I prove to myself if I'm alive or dead?

I (tried?) To kill myself a few months ago, and short of  a literal miracle that means I'm dead. I remember I was in my car. I heard the gun go off. Then all I heard was my ears ringing. I use reloaded ammo and the only way this is possible is I shot one that didn't have powder in it. I had to push the bullet out of the barrel because it got stuck.. 

But I think it worked. I think this life I'm living since then, is my personalized hell. My wife left me 2 and a half years ago. Since my (attempt?) our relationship has gotten better. To the point where I know 100% she cares and wants to be with me. She's just scared to make that step. She's right there, but no matter what I do, no matter what I say, she can't come back yet. Its like every time I think she's going to, something pulls her back. I haven't been able to land a job since that night too. Every time one comes up something else out of my control happens that I can't take it or they just don't hire me. Everyone in my life except my wife only use me for what I have or what I can do for them. My own family doesn't care about me. My dad actually tried to fight me and told me I could get out of his house and he doesn't care if I'm under a bridge, just because me and my sister got into an argument.


But looking at my life as a hole, all the things happening to me, are what I would believe my hell would look like. 

And now I can't stop thinking about it. What if I was successful. What if I am in hell and this is everything I deserve. I don't deserve my wife. I don't deserve a family that cares about me.

Induced Suicide through Medical Operations?,"First and foremost, I believe that banning ""suicidology"" was a mistake that did more harm than good.

Outright saying ""You're not allowed sharing your no-no thoughts"" is the most frustratingly misunderstood and harmful thing you can do, and if you don't understand that, you're part of the problem. 

All messages by people who ""want to help"" say to ""go ahead, talk, share"" but ""no-no thoughts bad"" - hypocrites. ***No-no thoughts are us reaching out.***

Let's say that you are going to have a surgery where you are going to be put to sleep.

What can you take to make the general anesthesia a one way trip?

Alcohol is out of the question, too many ways to tell, need to take too much too close, thin blood, general demeanor

It’s so selfish, and I do care about them, but all I can think about is the sweet release of death. Is there a way to ease the pain of my loved ones?

A story where the ending can't be found,"     About a year ago, I came to this sub with a post asking for help. Some people were there for me, and I hope anyone that puts themselves in the position to help someone starving for a release from the pain they're enduring understands what they mean to those people.
After I told my story, I told people about how I kept myself alive. 
By stalling. 
     I have been stalling for the past year. I have tried and tried my absolute best to keep going. I have completely cut contact off with everyone and everything that was doing me harm mentally. My ex and I have not interacted. Though sometimes I catch myself checking her socials to make sure she is okay. The best friends that betrayed me, I do the same. I have tried my hardest to find a creative outlet. Which has lead me down some wonderful paths, which have seemingly faded into nonexistence as I have gotten worse. I have gained weight as a side effect to this. I have tried drowning myself in objects, a new $2000 pc. Every current generation console. A new BMX bike. My favorite foods. None of this had brought me more than an hour of happiness each. 
     I cannot help but lay in bed and think that this is it for me. Stalling until I cannot go on. Until I am but a piece of trash in some cosmic waste bin. Every night I think about taking my life, and every night I struggle to stall until I fall asleep. 
    Tonight, this is my stalling. I don't know if I can stall much longer, as everything I love has become but something I cant comprehend. My brain feels like it cannot work apart from when I'm stalling. I have mental breakdowns weekly. Im scared to leave my house because I live so close to my ex, and I feel like if I see her, I will implode. I just want to be normal. I miss ""before"". 
Before I was completely broken down, shredded up, and turned into this glob of unending greyness. 
     I genuinely do not think I can stall for another month, let alone another year. I feel like the only way I can get away from this is to give up. I feel like a car that can't run anymore, I feel like my muscles are tearing one strand at a time, and my brain is slowly melting.

Change?,"Change?
What is change? What is time? What is life? Simply we cannot answer those questions exactly. I have been at the lowest you can go. And currently I am at the lowest point at the moment, I have these times when I know I want to make a change, to be better. Yet my own self contradicts me. I am my own enemy. I am my own guard. I don’t know why my mind is so against happiness, like ive said tons of times before happiness doesn’t want me. Simply I think how does one become happy? How do they....? I notice that I myself know I’m gonna die at a young age. It’s so sad to think like this but simply when someone says “there’s much more to life you have to have hope” those are meaningless words now....there is no hope. There isn’t much to life... I see that I am a negative person I wish to be someone very different. But I am stuck with this weight on my shoulders. I cry so hard bc I’m sad. I’m emotional. Maybe too much, but I cry so hard knowing that I want to be happy. That I want to feel important maybe it’s too much to ask. But I simply don’t get how people say they are so happy. I don’t wanna kill myself bc I’m simply too much of a coward. There had been moments that I wished nothing but death. I wanted to feel something. I guess at the end of the day it’s just a sad day. And this is all the time. I read this quote you see “sleep will never be enough if it’s your soul that’s tired” and I simply see the truth in this. You see no matter how much I sleep in and lay down. I’m constantly craving sleep. To be at rest for a bit. Getting through the day is hell but when I’m asleep I feel so loved and free. The world is sad. I’m sad. I feel I’m just not enough. I’m a problem. Simply put it that way. I’m dying slowly. Painfully slowly. -xx this just shows a small bit of my brain.

Forests of Oregon.,"I’m living in Fresno. I have been battling a lot. I truly do not have the support system I need , and I feel completely broken and useless. I’ve tried many routes and people who don’t understand wont understand this. 
 My body’s been used up , I’ve had family members molest me , beat me and abuse me in every way possible. I’ve watched my mom with a shotgun to her head to growing up now and realizing how fucked this world is. 
   In December of last year everyone forgot my bday which was fine sis turned 21 so I had like 4 blunts ready to go , so I just drank and met up w some dude to smoke , he laced my shit and I woke up a mess in my car in so much pain and he was gone. Blocked off the app I used and gone from my life.and I know he’s doing it to others. I failed to stop it. Being used the way I was while asleep has left me feeling COMPLETELY Downright disgusting. 
And now afterwards everything just hits. I’ve been in around 10 different places this year alone from Stockton to Fresno and in between. I feel so much more alienated the more I move. 
   I didn’t give up after the rape. I moved myself to Stockton with my little money , I fought my own anxiety’s until they were unbearable. Losing my high school crush to suicide right after finally starting to have him to myself in may.  to friends stealing from me and to my “ friend “ now kicking me out. It’s been a road. But I truly feel it’s the end. 
   I just wanna run away to Oregon and relieve myself there. Completely and fully. Idk how to do it and honestly don’t wanna do it alone , because the fear of pain and that moment of regret but I know I want to do it. I just wanna spend the weekend with the trees and swimming and smoking blunts and taking acid , I wanna fully cherish nature and then become one with it. This world isn’t for me. Growing in a world as an empath has no meaning but every piece of pain is like a knife and I’ve been truly staring at myself wondering why tf I’m still here. 
   Ide rather be in Oregon right now. 
 I wish I could have a suicide pact with someone but I couldn’t watch someone else go. Or have that thought to have a beautiful soul next to me go along w me. But it deff would make it easier. 
  ( sorry if this was a mess. there’s so much more to my pain but I just wanted to write quick.

I feel like i post too much on here,I opened up to my friend about being suicidal (i was really hesitant at first because she doesn’t have the best mental health either but she insisted she was fine). first she said that ruining everyone else’s lives would be like selfish of me. she also told me that she also tried killing herself 4 years ago and that she knew how i felt. she said she cared about me too. after a couple minutes she just left:c she said i should call a suicide hotline. idk i just wish i had never told her because now i feel kinda.. invalid? i don’t know if she meant for it to sound that way but like it seemed like she just brushed it off as “well i got out of it so you should too lol.” i don’t know why she wanted me to tell her so badly for her to just.. yeaahhh big mistake. i wish i was more reserved. she also told me that her sister attempted in january ? honestly the stuff she was telling me just made me feel like a shitty excuse for a friend because even after reaching out to her many times she never told me how bad she was feeling. i know i’m not that approachable to talk to but it pained me to know that nobody would come to me if they needed someone to talk to:( i know i wouldn’t have guilt tripped her into staying. she barely even texts me anyway. i reply to her stories all the time and i get responds like a week later. eek that was a lot of words but overall i feel even worse now than before i told her😗👍🏼,muhfukinwhale,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jghr8l/i_feel_like_i_post_too_much_on_here/,opened friend suicidal wa really hesitant first best mental health either insisted wa fine first said ruining everyone else life would like selfish also told also tried killing 4 year ago knew felt said cared couple minute left c said call suicide hotline idk wish never told feel kinda invalid know meant sound way like seemed like brushed well got lol know wanted tell badly yeaahhh big mistake wish wa reserved also told sister attempted january honestly stuff wa telling made feel like shitty excuse friend even reaching many time never told bad wa feeling know approachable talk pained know nobody would come needed someone talk know guilt tripped staying barely even text anyway reply story time get responds like week later eek wa lot word overall feel even worse told,feel like post much,uhf uk whale,1415,35,uhf uk whale opened friend suicidal wa really hesitant first best mental health either insisted wa fine first said ruining everyone else life would like selfish also told also tried killing 4 year ago knew felt said cared couple minute left c said call suicide hotline idk wish never told feel kinda invalid know meant sound way like seemed like brushed well got lol know wanted tell badly yeaahhh big mistake wish wa reserved also told sister attempted january honestly stuff wa telling made feel like shitty excuse friend even reaching many time never told bad wa feeling know approachable talk pained know nobody would come needed someone talk know guilt tripped staying barely even text anyway reply story time get responds like week later eek wa lot word overall feel even worse told feel like post much

Gonna kill myself next week,"Hi reddit,

29/F here, for reference.  

I'm going to kill myself next week. I've been barely hanging on, and have felt myself slipping more and more recently. Typically, I hide how depressed I am. It has been so bad I cry every day. My parents noticed. 

My family is so messed up. My sister is insanely depressed, and I ask her to talk to me and she refuses. She's afraid I'll share all her shit with my mom. My brother is crazy. He's basically schizophrenic, but doesn't know it yet - flat earth, 5G, anti-vax, microchips... the whole sha-bang. My youngest sister is getting married this week. I held off until after her wedding. I want her to be happy. 

I'm alone, with no dependents. Everyone I love has someone else. I reached out to my best friend/fuck-buddy, and she's basically tired of my shit. I am not over dramatic, nor do I use suicide as a manipulative tool. I'm going to overdose next week. That's it. I'm serious about it. I'm finally ready to try to do it. 

I tried to overdose a few weeks ago. It was more impulsive than anything.. but it made me comfortable with it. I had bad side effects for a few days, but I got over it. I can go through that again if I fail, but I don't think I will. I know the dosage I need and everything. I've researched it for years. I thought it would be into my 30s, but I guess this is close enough. 

That's all. I am putting this out there secretly hoping someone from my life notices and reaches out. I don't really count on any of you, no offense, because I've posted here before and haven't heard anything back after a few replies. Everyone has their own lives, and an internet stranger is essentially a non-person. It's easy to get removed. I'm not upset, but just know I don't expect an insincere attempt at helping me. I want someone to care and be there for me and **stay**, but nobody ever does. 

People **always** leave. 

Thanks for reading.",tulipoblastoma,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgdd99/gonna_kill_myself_next_week/,hi reddit 29 f reference going kill next week barely hanging felt slipping recently typically hide depressed ha bad cry every day parent noticed family messed sister insanely depressed ask talk refuse afraid share shit mom brother crazy basically schizophrenic know yet flat earth 5g anti vax microchip whole sha bang youngest sister getting married week held wedding want happy alone dependent everyone love ha someone else reached best friend fuck buddy basically tired shit dramatic use suicide manipulative tool going overdose next week serious finally ready try tried overdose week ago wa impulsive anything made comfortable bad side effect day got go fail think know dosage need everything researched year thought would 30 guess close enough putting secretly hoping someone life notice reach really count offense posted heard anything back reply everyone ha life internet stranger essentially non person easy get removed upset know expect insincere attempt helping want someone care stay nobody ever doe people always leave thanks reading,gonna kill next week,tulip oblast oma,1906,27,tulip oblast oma hi reddit 29 f reference going kill next week barely hanging felt slipping recently typically hide depressed ha bad cry every day parent noticed family messed sister insanely depressed ask talk refuse afraid share shit mom brother crazy basically schizophrenic know yet flat earth 5g anti vax microchip whole sha bang youngest sister getting married week held wedding want happy alone dependent everyone love ha someone else reached best friend fuck buddy basically tired shit dramatic use suicide manipulative tool going overdose next week serious finally ready try tried overdose week ago wa impulsive anything made comfortable bad side effect day got go fail think know dosage need everything researched year thought would 30 guess close enough putting secretly hoping someone life notice reach really count offense posted heard anything back reply everyone ha life internet stranger essentially non person easy get removed upset know expect insincere attempt helping want someone care stay nobody ever doe people always leave thanks reading gonna kill next week

I'm afraid to kill myself because I am transgender.,"I desperately need to get out of this world and that isn't only because of the struggles I have faced being trans. If I had to quantify it, it would barely be a quarter of the reasons I want to kill myself. 

Yet, I'm afraid that if I kill myself, I'll be buried under the statistic that comes with trans people killing themselves. All the other reasons, all the other struggles I've faced socially, educationally, and with family, will all be overcome by me being trans. 

It'll just be like nothing else mattered. How people treated me. How I felt bad for treating others. What I did. What other people did. 

None of that would matter. 
It would all be because I am trans. And that terrifies me. 

It would be a scapegoat. Just another tranny killing themself.

Nothing to be sad about.

"Why when someone via reddit, quora or hell even real life is projecting something bad on me, like their insecurities and with their friends gang up on me to insult me, but if I share that my trauma is bigger than someone people both online and irl jump on me and harass me and do not stop","I have had a few situations in real life and three online where people project their insecurities on me and it was somehow fine but if i ever complained about their behaviour towards me which is abusive I was called drama queen and told to shut up, one person even pushed me. I do not believe every person who is an ass to me is a narcissist but i do mot know what to think. Some people have mentioned that i may look somehow vulnerable so people are okay with bullying me but i do not know.

"I'm just going to get all my pain and emotions out into the void, sorry","I'm sorry for being born without wanting anything, I'm sorry for not wanting to struggle and fight others for a chance to have fame and fortune, I don't want it. I don't want anything but the brief pleasure I get from learning something from entertainment, eating food, or having sex.   


Every time I have to go to a job, or deal with a flat tire or talk to someone when I don't want to, or do anything I dislike... it makes me want to blow my brains out. Anything, any inconvenience it makes me want to die. I've been in love, I've had sex, I've had good food, I've been to foreign countries on beautiful islands, it's nice, as soon as it's over though life becomes not worthwhile and even sometimes during it's not worthwhile.   


I hate people I despise people people are so fucking stupid it's amazing, so hypocritical, so selfish. When I see good people it just makes me sad how hard they have to work to not get stepped on. But then I also hate myself, I'm so average physically and mentally. I feel like a giant piece of shit looking down on people, who am I to look down on others?? And yet I can't escape the truth or my version of the world, whatever it is, it makes me hate everyone and everything. The fact that the US is so incompetent with education, crime, healthcare, anything. I don't know how I'm supposed to just suffer through all this shit and cancer.   


The good times aren't worth the bad times or even the tranquil times. It's shit. It's bullshit, the optimists make me want to smash my brains out, why can't I be happy like them and assume everything will work out and not see the nuance of any situation, only take 2 secs to consider someone else's opinions.  Or the fucking pieces of shit who hate everyone and think there's a man in the sky who wants to kill gay people and won't let you eat shrimp. How am I expected to live in a world where 80% of people are one of these two types. The leaders of the world just jerk off and pull in cash for themselves, it's a hard life I get it, but positive change is so slow for humanity I can't be bothered to help push the boulder up the hill for the next generation, fuck them. I don't give a fuck about them.   


I'm 22, I learned piano, I learned programming, it just made me realize how little I want to touch or do anything, even music which I love more than anything will never fix my disposition of having to do things. Another terrible trait is how lazy I am because of this, how am I expected to accomplish anything though if I have no desire to do anything, I don't want to burden others with myself, not because I care about them, but because it would hurt my ego to be sitting in a room for the rest of my life with people who love me and look at how pathetic I am. I am just a man like many other men, more fortunate than 99% of any human who has ever lived, and yet I can do nothing with everything given to me, fuck me. I'm listening to chambers of reflection on repeat while typing this (fun edgy shit I'm too old to be listening to fucking mac demarco and be depressed but I guess that's life) feels like I never had the chance to be anything and I lived my life to make my parents happy until I realized I that isn't enough to motivate me to live. Tried to find my own reasons to live and I've realized there is no reason. We make up our reason to live and I can't make up mine. Oh well. Time to be forgotten.

"when i was a freshman in high school i thought I would never make it to senior year, yet here I am, with absolutely no idea what I'm going to do with my life","I didn't think I would survive for this long, and now I'm just a dumb high school kid with some kind of mental health problem. I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me, my mind is so fucked up and I'm pretty sure I have adhd and anxiety or maybe I'm a sociopath because at times I'm extremely emotionally numb &amp; I hate feeling happy/positive emotions. sometimes I'm too aggressive or I stutter too much and I feel like I'm an annoying and useless piece of shit. I also have trichotillomania but I would never admit that to anyone I know.

lately when I'm doing work I get so anxious about my future and school that I can't focus on what I'm doing and end up wasting time, making myself feel even more shitty. my brain is scattered and cloudy and I can never have a full, clear thought. I get distracted so easily. I really have to get into college, but I don't think my parents believe I can (btw my parents are asian immigrants). I'm a above average student, I'm smarter than the average but not smart enough to be comparable to the students who take all ap classes/get a full score on the SATs/etc. when I was younger, I was praised and expected to be a ""star student"" and I stopped actually trying to put effort because I thought I was smart enough. I wish I didn't do that and I wish I studied harder in middle school. now I'm just lazy and unproductive. the only extracurricular stuff I've done is band/music/art stuff, but I don't even want to pursue music as a career. I've done nothing in my life and now it's coming back to fuck me over. I have nothing to show for the colleges.

I've been thinking about suicide since I was 13 and how everything would be so much better if I never existed, if I never felt pain or anything. I don't think I've ever self harmed but I've started banging my head whenever I'm under stress (which happens so randomly) and pulling my hair (as I mentioned earlier) to try to cope with it. I know it's bad for my health but I can't help it and I don't know how to stop. sometimes I imagine myself dead from drowning in the bathtub of my mom's bathroom, limp and lifeless. sometimes I get a quick urge to take a scissor or the nearest sharpest object and stab myself in the eye. I can't tell anyone about this because they won't listen, my parents never really received mental health education so they wouldn't get it, I'm too distanced from my friends and they probably think I'm fine because I act like it, and a therapist would most likely be impossible and too expensive. nobody in my life fucking knows and understands any of this. 

the only reasons why I'm still alive is that I don't want my mom to think how much money she wasted on me and I don't want one of my best friends to feel responsible for me. I don't want my friends to suffer or cry because I'm dead.

but I want to die. I don't know what my future is going to be like, if I don't get a job and earn money in the future what the fuck is the point? how am I going to live like that? if I'm going to die I hope I die sooner than later. also im trans and my parents &amp; most people don't know and I fucking hate it when someone calls me by the wrong pronouns (obviously it's not their fault but still). every time someone make a transphobic remark towards me (both online and irl) it makes me want to die. I don't have a fucking place in society, the whole world is terrible, and nobody actually cares about me. I'm a waste of everything and my brain doesn't function like a normal person's brain does and all I can do is pretend everything is fine and hope a car accidentally runs me over and kills me so I don't have to deal with any of this anymore.

My life has been a living hell created by myself.,"What can I possibly do besides suicide when my life has been nothing but a huge brick to the face because not matter what I do to fix my problems. More arise and wont stop! It's a nightmare  I'm posting here because I wanna be heard, I have  nothing to lose I have no family no friends and the person whom I cared for and loved so much, left me because of my past because I was destined to be stabbed and treated  wrong for the rest of my life ? and I am witness to my mistakes in the past never been to jail never broken the rules too much never been a drinker or a party guy too much. I was born in a different country called Panama between north and south america, my mom left me in that country 1 year after I was born, she left with my siblings my oldest sister and brother, I was raised by my grandfather and grandma they were all fantastic and good parents to me throught my childhood till I was 6 and my grandfather died of cancer all suddenly lung and throat cancer even tho he had quit many years b4 but I guess still happened. Then my mom called and told my grandma to not put me in the school for the whole year cuz she was coming to get me, she was currently living in the US and became a citizen, so the whole year went by and never came and got me. I was disappointed, I was then raped by someone who my grandma left me with after school the next year after I I turned 7 I never remember the incident for a long time.
6 years later she somehow came and got me with my new green card, I was removed from my friends and everyone I once knew and was very close to .
A month after I got here not knowing English at all was sent to middle middle school and 2 years behind because of my language barrier I was put in a advance esl  class for the whole year my teacher was a bad teacher and used to lose her shit with me because it was hard for me to concentrate, used to call me stupid becUse out of all the 12 students there, I was the only one not talking much but is because I was intimidated, somehow I passed the class and left that school from Dallas, I then moved to McKinney Texas and went to high school there, i did a whole year there and then my mom and my brothers and I, had to move to Dallas again during winter, we then moved to mesquite tx and stayed there for 5 years on and off becUse me and my mother got into it many times because she always treated me as different than my siblings so i started not caring and just left high school and started living with friends since I was 16 and 17 I was out and doing my own things for a little while I even moved to Oklahoma then back to Dallas and had my first 2 childs with two different woman one fucked me over and the other one just kinda  kept me out and my other one fucked me over and cheated on me while I was a at work, she would call her ex husband and take off with my daughter and never paid a thing in my apartment I cooked and cleaned when I could after work, I worked in a commercial printing warehouse and I worked almost every day maybe one day off and, somehow my green card went missing out of my wallet and a week after that, everything  started to hit me hard, my ex had waited till I got fired and then I went to take a nape with my daughter so i could wake up and have energy for my next move, but when I woke up, my newborn daughter took off with my daughter and my car and then i called cops but they couldn't help because that was her mother but if I would had been awake would have been a different story, I then got into a big depression i let some friends stay there while i would go to work and stay at my .moms for a while cuz the job was close to her house, and but I couldn't keep paying for my apartment no more becaUse my new job didn't paid me enough and then I had no ride to go to my old place because those friends stopped responding, and my parents wouldn't take me so I then find out that those friends of mine got cops called on my place and they were trying to run drugs and party hard there and so they got caught and I didn't have enough time to go get my things and leave so I lost everything I had, and now that I had no green card I could not find any jobs that would hire me so I met another chick who also cheated on me and got pregnant and didn't tell. Me and so a year passed by and after I got with this burnt survivor chick, my ex finds my number and texted me asking me 8f I wanted to meet my son and I did and he looked like me and we had a connection within a few weeks of been meeting up with him, 4 weeks later she asked me and my girlfriend at the time if we could take care of him because she couldn't and she didn't want him and I was all excited but I was living with that burned chick and I only donated plasma and did odd jobs from time to time to help but then Anastasia which was the burnt chick, got all excited and said she wanted to help me get my kids back and so I thought was strange but I accepted and thanked her for it but after a few months of him staying with us and making me very happy, Anastasia starts telling me that she called CPS on. My sons mom. Because she wanted to have my kid living with us without her ever coming back for him which  it bothered me becUse that was kind of unnecessary and so my ex's kid got taken away and my son was then. Involved with CPS under some type of plan, to keep my sons mother away from my son, then a year or so passed by and Anastasia starts to act different and accuse me of shit because she had PTSD and other mental issues and so she was the type to wake up in the middle of the night screaming, or punching u, or to start a fight, and one night she took it too far and I had to grab my son from the bed because she started arguing with me and swinging her hands around like a child, I was afraid for me and my son and so she got up and while I had my half sleep baby on my. Arms she tried swinging at me so I turned my body and turned again and grabbed her arm and slightly pushed her onto the bed so I tried walking out with my son and she then ran to the front door and blocked me from going anywhere so I freaked out and called the cops and so I get her to calm down and I then the cops come and hear my story and hers but she was lying to them saying I hit her when I never hit no woman I told them. That I was defending my self and my son and that she hit me and I showed my Mark's and I told them I did pushed her because she was way too close to me while acting odd, so then she gets taken away and they asked me to press charges and but I never did because I felt bad and I did care for her and I didn't want to do that to my son so the day I went to sign the documents releasing her from her going to court, but also mostly because she begged me and begged. Me and also asked my mom to get her to get me to just not press charges on Anastasia and believe it or not I signed it and gave her the benefit if the doubt but the moment i did that, she went and called her parents and told them all of the things that happened and made me look horrible, why?, I have no idea, so then I started doing drugs because she got sick and got taken to the hospital I had to take care of my kid alone for a few months and had no job so had to come up with ways, I used drugs to keep up with my shoes because I was so tired, I was known around the complex because I was working on people's cars while I had my son at day care paid by cps, I got addicted but never let it keep me away from taking care of my kid but then she came back for 2 weeks I had to help her off the bed and to shower and to do all sorts of things and her treating me like shit everyday and screaming and omg it was the most stressful thing and was messing with me and then she went. Back to the hospital for 2 more months and then she comes back and made my life hell because I told her I was doing drugs and told her why but then I thought I could trust her but she turned out to be the devil and used that against me and started pushing me back and while I would go out to make money, she would go behind my back and assume i was cheating or God knows what when I was at work I had witnes3s, but she was also signing documents and suddenly I wasnt getting any kind of taxes so she started getting ng all of this money and I didn't know how taxes worked but when I did find out she was keeping all of this money from having my child living with us I got mad and confronted her about it cuz non of it was going to him we had all of his toys donated to us so where was this money going and so she would say she had it hidden for him and I just left it alone but then I had a bad feeling so I asked her when could she help me find a way to have me sign my sons birth certificate but because of my legal situation I couldn't do it my self, so I made her have power of attorney and she said she would help me but never did instead she would lie to me till the very end then got me caught up with CPS and locked.me out of the house and took off with my kid and I never got to sign it and then cps found meth in my system and so yay, now I was stuck with this embarrassing shit and after passing everything for 8 months. They kept lying to me telling g me I would see him as long I comply and I did the best I could but then I got with the woman of my dreams and but my ex found out about her and threw cps on her and her daughter and I 3nded moving with her temporarily and then months go by and now my current woman was getting very stressed out blaming me for her having cps on her for no reason. Just jealousy I guess and I got under alot of pressure and hurt by everything i was doing to help others and trying my best to do better at life I end up moving to my friends home and my coworker and we would work on his house on cars he was my teacher but my cousin dies and my uncle died too from covid and so I lost my shit and started doing meth again 2 wise and somehow I blacked out and messaged my friends brother and my best friends 14 or 16 year old daughter and I couldn't remember and I then lost my job and my best friend and then I apologized to them and couldn't believe that i did that and i feel so bad every day. And but i was still with my woman and i told her what i knew and to forgive me but i never seen anyone behind her back i was very truthful to her but after months of knowing then that guy calls cps on me about it saying I sent a nude to a minor or solicited to a minor and the worst part is that I ain't even that type of person fuck no and I felt disgusted and I wanted to hung my self because  I was on drugs my woman lied to the cps guy so he could leave us,  me alone and I thanked her, but ever since, she has not been the same, i don't wanna lose her she  is my everything because we help each other and thanks to her i have been staying clean thanks to her I treat her like my queen but today she told me she wanted to leave me because of the past and she just wanted to be loved again was the only reason I was chosen to be with her but now because my past even tho I was truthful, she doesn't trust me  thinking that if I do drugs again I would probably do that again. And I promised her I wouldn't but is my word vs everyone else's I feel like the world is against me even tho I only have eyes for her and good heart for others.  At the same time  I'm trying to get me a lawyer to get a green card and work again. And I'm trying to get a lawyer to help me get my son and prove that he was kidnapped and that I was scammed  and my self situated but I feel like. NOt matter how hard I try and nor how much i help others to change my luck, I end up getting fucked over or back stabbed and hurts and since last year I have been very suicidal because I know I am a piece of shit and I keep failing at life and there's alot more to the whole story than this but is all I can let out for now and needed... advice because I feel like I'm going

Why do people try to commit suicide through ways that won’t kill them 100% of the times,"Ive been suicidal for years but I’ve never attempted any suicides... I’m just waiting for the perfect moment and for my grandma to die, she is honestly such an angel and she her self is suicidal apparently but she continued living for 80+. She kinda suspects I’m suicidal so she tells me to just keep on living even though life fucking sucks. I just can’t do this while she’s still alive.

But if I were to do it (which is very likely), I would just jump off the biggest cliff I can find. Every time I move to a new city or country I always google what are the nearest cliffs around cause I can’t afford to fail. I see these people trying to kill themselves through uncertain ways like pills and cutting and that just bothers me for some reason. I want something instant that won’t fail.

I want to kill myself,"Everything is hopeless there’s no way to convince people to be nice to each other and I just can’t live like this anymore. I have no family and I just want to die. I am disabled and burnt out from work. I wish I could work less and take care of myself but every single day is just stressful. I am avoiding work right now to post this because I can’t take it anymore. I just want to die quietly without anyone knowing. I didn’t ask to be born into this fucked up society. If someone tells me one more time that capitalism is good while I’m suffocating because of it, I will probably just stab myself in the stomach and get it over with. I try so hard to have hope for a better tomorrow but liberation looks so far away because of the alt right, and the moderates support conservatism, and the liberals support capitalism. I’ll never make it in this society. I consider moving to another country but I have no idea what I would do for work. Everything is work work work work. There is no truly communist society out there. I want to dispose of myself because I am worthless anyway. I hope everyone who told me to kill myself online will someday learn to be a kinder person, not for me but for someone else. Nihilism is so toxic but it’s overwhelming me and it’s so hard for me to stop those thoughts.",[deleted],2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jg34k0/i_want_to_kill_myself/,everything hopeless way convince people nice live like anymore family want die disabled burnt work wish could work le take care every single day stressful avoiding work right post take anymore want die quietly without anyone knowing ask born fucked society someone tell one time capitalism good suffocating probably stab stomach get try hard hope better tomorrow liberation look far away alt right moderate support conservatism liberal support capitalism never make society consider moving another country idea would work everything work work work work truly communist society want dispose worthless anyway hope everyone told kill online someday learn kinder person someone else nihilism toxic overwhelming hard stop thought,want kill,deleted,1298,21,deleted everything hopeless way convince people nice live like anymore family want die disabled burnt work wish could work le take care every single day stressful avoiding work right post take anymore want die quietly without anyone knowing ask born fucked society someone tell one time capitalism good suffocating probably stab stomach get try hard hope better tomorrow liberation look far away alt right moderate support conservatism liberal support capitalism never make society consider moving another country idea would work everything work work work work truly communist society want dispose worthless anyway hope everyone told kill online someday learn kinder person someone else nihilism toxic overwhelming hard stop thought want kill
It's interesting how none of this is gonna matter in the first place,"We're all gonna die eventually anyway, right? So does it matter if it's sooner rather than later? I'm 16 and even if I do manage to live till 25, I know suicide will kill me eventually. 

I'm so tired of trying to help my friends and not being able to do enough. They come to me and I try, I swear I fucking try, but its never enough. It happens all the time and then no one ever, ever checks on me. I'm not asking them to, I dont want them to waste their time, but it doesn't hurt any less.

2017 a friend forced me to go to my school counsellor. I was in the hospital and I remember just shutting down. I couldn't talk at all. A crisis counsellor came and tried to talk to me, then said to just write it down. I remember my mum saying to say that I'm not gonna go through with anything so they don't take me to a psychiatric hospital. 

I regret doing what she said. I think maybe, in some other life it would have helped me. I just went to therapy for a bit but then begged to quit. Sometimes I wish I could get back in. Sometimes i wish I could ask them to seriously have me admitted or let me see someone who could let me get medication or SOMETHING. Every single fucking day my head is so fucked up, so dark, and I just deal with it. I don't tell anyone. I'll laugh and be happy sometimes but it just comes back around eventually. Sometimes I'll just think the darkest shit on how I could hurt myself or soemtimes othet people. I would never do the second part, but I know it's not normal. I need help and I can't get it. I'm fucking terrified. And even if I don't commit suicide now or ten years from now, I know I'll do it eventually.

I don’t see the point of going on because this diagnosis probably forever, the only reason I’m not offing myself is because it’ll destroy my family and my sister would go into such a horrible depression she wouldn’t be able to look after her young kids.

Why get mad over suicide,"To all the people on here that’s has never been truly suicidal, doesn’t have a mental health issue or just wants to help why do parents or friends or whoever get mad when you tell them ur suicidal. I had this conversation with my roommate and his gf and they where like oh they just don’t know what to do and I’m kinda just like ur first instinct is to get mad and yell are u that insensitive that u don’t understand that person who is suicidal is in a highly volatile state.

"Girlfriend has been getting deeper and deeper into depression in the last 2-3 weeks, and yesterday told me she's thought about suicide. I'm trying everything I can... but I feel powerless.","Sorry for the long post...

If you wish for more background regarding our relationship, you can check my previous posts in my profile... please don't judge the age gap, it's not what we need right now...

She's been depressed for the last few weeks, because she feels like her life is falling apart:
- Her toxic ex with his toxic new family keeps getting in her life... and since the girl is their daughter, he will never ""leave forever"". She's been trying to file a proper separation since March-April, and finally contacted a lawyer a few weeks ago (apparently thanks to me, because she would had never felt brave enough by herself)... but this got her more badly that either of us could ever think, feeling like a failure... not giving her daughter a true family. Meanwhile, since she still has to stay in touch with her ex because of their daughter, he keeps insulting her, calling her names (especially once she told him about me), a ""whore"", someone who ""wants someone young just to fuck"", a ""disgrace to her daughter""... even IN FRONT of their daughter! Threatening to ""tell her what her shameful mother does""... 

- She's left her working place last year after 20 years because she knew she could do much more with her life... to actually feel ""alive"". Therefore she's started studying (that's how we met)... but being older than most students, she feels like she can't keep up, and although she's passed a few exams, she couldn't make it with the last one (which required MONTHS to be studied, with her sacrificing for it any time she had... to the point where we agreed not to meet to often until she was done). And with the new semester having started and the many lectures she should actively attend (even 12 consecutive hours on some days!), she's been thinking about just giving up on University, feeling like an idiot for even trying.

- Although she LOVES with her whole heart her daughter... she realizes she requires almost all of her time and energy. Again, sacrificing our time together, her studies... and ""her life"". I've always reassured her that her daughter must come first, and that I can be patient and wait for the right time to meet. And she's been living with her mother since she's broken up with her ex, but she's starting to develop dementia. But to top it all... she still depends on her ex to keep the daughter when she can't (and he depends on her himself). He just reschedules his life in order to screw up hers, involves her in the issues he has with his own first daughter he had from a previous marriage (14 years old... once, she ran off to ""meet her boyfriend she met online"")... and is always lurking around since they live close, keeping an eye on her... and still asking her to get back together!
So... she's feeling trapped. No escape.

- And then there's me... I dealt with depression myself in the past, so I've started living only recently (worked whole least year, started to study to get a proper job, got a driving license...)... but I still live with my parents, who have always been toxic, manipulative and extremely protective. I need a year and a half to end my studies, and I'll finally be 100% independent.
We've been extremely happy together, to the point that she's told me that she's never lived such a relationship before, as if she was living the actual ""first love"", made of emotions and not just ""mechanical"". But... she's also told me that she thought I was more independent. And since I had to even FAKE a break up with her since my family was freaking out about it, I got even less freedom, and started having to lie to them, repeatedly, just to see her as much as I could. I myself felt more and more confident about planning things... even a couple of travels! But I can't give her all the help I wish I could... when she talks about having someone by her side, to live a proper family with, I wish that could already be me... but I still need to finally put together the basis my life before. At least get a proper job to contribute.

Starting with the separation, I noticed something was off... she asked me for time for herself, to think about it and her life (again, it was a hit heavier than she thought on her)... I gave it to her, not meeting up but still keeping in contact, every day.
The quarrels with her ex got worse and worse... while videochatting, she started crying and telling me she couldn't take it anymore, that she has never done anything wrong in her life and yet kept having everything against her. Of course, I always tried to reassure her, to distract her with anything else, all the positive and lightier things in her life... she would always smile at the end, thanking me for being there for her.

She started having heavy mood swings... she had already tried a couple of times to break up with me because apparently I ""need to live my own life with a young girl, not waste it after a deluded old one"". It worked only the very first time, when I myself had my doubts, only for us to get back together a few hours later, missing each other and realizing we're ""a couple of autodestructive idiots"". 
But this attitude showed up more and more lately, because I ""shouldn't waste time with a woman whose life is just falling apart"", and I always told her I would never leave just because something's wrong... I love her too much. This happened probably 3 times in the last weeks, always followed by words of love from her, about how lucky she is of having me...
Last time, she asked me to ""detach from her"" because she didn't want her depression to get to me, since I ""can live a great life without her"". Absolutely no, I refused.

But she got quieter and quieter. We haven't met for 19 days now, although we're messaging and calling each other EVERY day... we should had met two Saturdays ago, but turns out her lawyer for the separation tested positive fro COVID, so she had to stay isolated for a while (she resulted negative in the end); we should had met last Friday, but her ex rescheduled at the last minute and couldn't keep their daughter, so she had to; we should had met last Monday, but forgot she had new lectures, and since she's not doing well we don't want her to skip classes; we should had met today... but she's ""feeling dead inside"", and in the last couple days she's only wanted to sleep, more and more, even skipping schedules...

She's dealt with depression already in her past, so she knows a psychologist she trusts that she hasn't met for a while, since things were good. She met her yesterday, and the psychologist told her she's ""never seen her so destroyed"", diagnosing her with huge depression, probably also caused by her illness (she has lupus, which untreated correctly can lead to depression).

And when I called her to know about what the psychologist told her... while talking about other things, she suddenly told me, in a whisper and on the verge of crying, she's thought about suicide, and that she keeps going just for her daughter. 
...I can't deny I thought about it, but of course never brought it up in order not to trigger something. I know she's thought about it years ago, but succeeded by herself on refusing and seeking help... so I worried she could get such thoughts. I tried to say something... that's it's a way for our mind to find an escape... an extreme escape... that she should not feed such thought... and I was at a loss of what to say. I didn't know what to say to help her. While I was speaking though, she changed the subject and I followed it...
Half an hour after our call, she wrote me ""thank you for supporting me, and being there when I'm giving you the worst part of me"".

So, we should had met today. I hoped I could finally do something more for her by meeting in presence... even just a hug, to make her feel safer. I've been wishing for it for weeks now. I don't expect to magically cure her depression... but at least, to give her some happy moments...
...but when I wrote her our usual good morning... she replied that she won't make it today. It's too tiring, she doesn't feel the strength... she's feeling dead. She would had just brought her daughter to school, and then gone back home to sleep more. I suggested her I could reach her to her place, so she doesn't have to move... but she refused and asked me not to insist. I agreed, told her I'd be waiting for her messages, and told her I love her.

...I don't know what to do. I've been crying the whole day, not because I can't meet her... but because I'm scared she could do something awful. Yesterday she didn't appear online on any social for 4 hours, which is unusual for her... I started panicking, thinking something happened since she was alone at home, the daughter was at school... but in the end she was just sleeping...

I don't know if I should message her or if I should just give her time and wait for her to contact me... if I should tell her again I'm just worried (thus worrying/upsetting her), or write about anything else (looking as if I don't care)... if I should LOOK/SOUND worried or strong to her... if I should reach her place regardless of what she thinks is good for her now, or respect any boundaries she asks for...

If she asks me how I am... how should I reply?? ""Awful because I'm worried"" (the truth, but making her feel more of a burden), or something else thus looking as if I didn't care?

I'm powerless, and all I have is long distance communication... I've always helped her in everything, to the point where once she was moved and on the verge of crying for how much I care for her... but I don't know how to help her now.

Her next psychologist appointment is on the 9th... I'm scared of her waiting for so long...",SimoneDS176,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgjmyw/girlfriend_has_been_getting_deeper_and_deeper/,sorry long post wish background regarding

I feel so empty.,"I have been having suicidal thoughts lately. I've been really down as I can never seem to find someone that loves me back. I've been trying so hard to get through school and it's tough because I'm overwhelmed. I have a hard time paying attention in my classes cause I just feel awful all the time. Even things I'm passionate about I can't bring myself to do. I have a really hard time finding happiness and it keeps getting worse. I have a really hard time talking about my feelings and usually keep it to myself. I have only told one person and it was really hard for me and I had a mental breakdown when I told them even though it was someone I trust. I don't know exactly why I'm sad all the time as I don't know if I have any mental issues like depression as I have never been diagnosed. And I cant really get diagnosed because I dont think my parents will take it seriously and I have a hard time trusting them as they always tell everyone personal stuff about me. I feel like therapy or medicine would be really helpful but I don't think I will ever be able to tell my parents. I feel so trapped and lost. I hate myself and I always wonder why I lack motivation to do anything. I can barely bring myself to learn about what I'm trying to get into for a career even though it is a job I would absolutely love to have. I talk to my friend about my feelings but he is the only one I feel like I can trust. But it makes me sad to talk to him because we are good friends and I don't want to make him sad. I have just felt so empty and have started self harming again. I still talk with my friend when I need to. But I feel like if I'm gonna be like this all my life where I feel so awful 90 percent of the time, is it really worth living? I don't know. I always think about how much my friends would be affected if I kill myself. But this place really sucks. I don't think I will kill my self anytime soon but its just really hard.

There’s no reason for me to keep on living.,"I have no friends or motivation for anything. I’m failing all of my classes and I really hate the people in my family. They just make me feel even more out of place and shitty than I already am. I don’t care about this stupid bullshit “oh your mom loves you like no one else.” She has done more damage than good by giving me trauma that I can’t seem to get over and denying my problems because she would instead like to give me her shitty advice instead of letting me seek professional help. She’s just a cheap ass who wants to save her buck instead of her child and I will never forgive her for that. She got a second job cause she wanted more money and then started talking about how she’s gonna start going to a therapist. So do we not have fucking money for a therapist or have you been lying? No wait you just don’t give a single fuck about me. Forgot about that. 

I have no reason to keep going. I just have no one. No friends. No one checking up on me. I’ve lost all of my friends. They don’t think it care about me anymore. My grades are all F’s and I am going to fail the semester. I’m fat and disgusting and don’t even bother looking in the mirror anymore. If no one is here for me then what’s the point of anything? There is none. I am not going to succeed at anything and my life is just a fucking joke. I deserve to suffer.

I’m kind of a loser.,"As far as positive qualities go, I am of average intelligence, I am organized, I have good time management skills, and I’m an ok writer, but honestly that’s pretty much it.

Negative qualities on the other hand, I’m ugly, I’m introverted, I’m a nerd, I recently gained back the weight I had lost, I’m socially awkward, I don’t have very good self-control, I’m bad at athletics to the point that I don’t even want to play games outside with my friends because me being involved just makes it annoying for everyone else, I’m on prescription medication for depression, and in general I’m just kind of a loser. There are probably more bad qualities I have but the list goes on so long that it’s hard to remember all of the reasons I’m worthless.

Throughout my earlier years I was even worse than I am now. I’ve made so many dumb mistakes that I’ll never forgive myself for and  will never be able to forget, that It feels like I’m being eaten alive.

What makes this all worse is I have nothing in life that should keep me from being a good person. I’m a white male who was born into a middle class family. My family has loved and cared for me my entire life. My parents never split up. I had a large number of bad medical issues that my parents paid to have fixed. And now they decided that they would pay my tuition for a nice private university. And with all of that going for me I still managed to turn out as a fat fucking loser.

I just feel like I’m just a walking debt. Talking to me is a waste of time, getting me involved in things just makes them harder, being friends with me is a chore, and I’ve cost my parents 5 times my weight in gold. It feels like I just exist to burden the nice people around me and suck the fun out of anything I’m involved in. Now that I’m at college I try to call home weekly and when I do I get rushed off of the phone, and when I text I get weirdly over positive replies. It’s like their lives are better without me around  and their only paying for my college so that they don’t have to keep me around them. Being like this is just too much for me to handle sometimes. I’d do anything to be anyone other than myself. Sometimes I feel like I’d be better if I didn’t exist at all.

I doubt I will end up killing myself. I’ve never attempted to, planned to, or put any serious thought or effort into trying to kill myself. It’s more like the thought of letting all the pressure in my mind fizzle into nothingness is a thought so comforting that I am often disturbed by it. And it prompted me to post my thoughts here. I’m not smart enough to know if thoughts like that are a genuine risk for me and trying to figure that out for myself would just confuse me. All I know is that I don’t hate myself more than I love the people who care for me which is probably what’s kept me from pursuing suicide as a course of action. I can’t really think of anything else that keeps me from doing it other than a vague fear of death and maybe doughnuts. But regardless of what it is suicide has never come up as a genuine option in my head. It just pops into my head sometimes when I’m mulling over my actual options for solving the problems in front of me. The honest thing that drove me to post this was the fact that I just failed my term test in physics 1 like an hour ago and while mulling over methods of improving my studying, and things I can do to improve my grades I was like “man I wish I was just dead”.

These thoughts are slowly creeping in and I'm struggling to keep them out.,"Hey Reddit,

I have had a lot of luck in life I  think. Good, loving family, great friends and girlfriend. I was at the peak of my life last year. Finishing college, had a job almost guaranteed and was recognized as a great worker. I was making a nice profit from a sports betting side project. I remember thinking how great life was going to be like this.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, I was kicked out of college. Basically, I screwed up in my early years and had bad grades, had a written arrangement with the college to prove myself with good grades, which I did, but after many formal meetings and ""sueing"" them within the college's lawyer for students, they had the right to refuse me for whatever reason regardless of the grades. My job, which was a student job with the government, was terminated since being a student was obligatory. A week later, a friend of mine spills water on my 4000$ laptop (won at a contest) and I lose my side project of sports betting.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm an optimistic guy, but I could name a thousand more examples recently in which I'm trying to get my life back on track, and I get sidelined over some reason, and it's starting to make no sense. Past two years, I lost 4 family members unexpectedly and wasn't able to say goodbye so fast they were gone, I have been able to put that aside and self reflect on how that makes me feel for later, but recently with everything I try to invest myself falling apart, I'm really starting to believe there's something or someone that pushes me down and makes me lose everything I have. I'm scared to do everyday actions, opening a letter is a nightmare, I think about what bad news I'll have and it's driving me crazy. I don't want to upset my girlfriend and our next step was to have a family (when I had a job), so I try to look optimistic, but I am scared shitless. Every time I try to get back up I get kicked a flight of stairs, I'm a reasonable and logic guy, but fucking damnit, what are the odds of everything happening to me to be simply circumstances? I'm running out of fake smiles and generic speeches that it's been rough for I'm fine. I'm not, I'm starting to believe these irrational things and I can't afford being hurt again, my efforts don't pay off anywhere.",throaway84492,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgj6op/these_thoughts_are_slowly_creeping_in_and_im/,hey reddit lot luck life think good loving family great friend girlfriend wa peak life last year finishing college job almost guaranteed wa recognized great worker wa making nice profit sport betting side project remember thinking great life wa going like amp x200b wa kicked college basically screwed early year bad grade written arrangement college prove good grade many formal meeting sueing within college lawyer student right refuse whatever reason regardless grade job wa student job government wa terminated since student wa obligatory week later friend mine spill water 4000 laptop contest lose side project sport betting amp x200b optimistic guy could name thousand example recently trying get life back track get sidelined reason starting make sense past two year lost 4 family member unexpectedly able say goodbye fast gone able put aside self reflect make feel later recently everything try invest falling apart really starting believe something someone push make lose everything scared everyday action opening letter nightmare think bad news driving crazy want upset girlfriend next step wa family job try look optimistic scared shitless every time try get back get kicked flight stair reasonable logic guy fucking damnit odds everything happening simply circumstance running fake smile generic speech rough fine starting believe irrational thing afford hurt effort pay anywhere,thought slowly creeping struggling keep,thro away 84492,2247,74,thro away 84492 hey reddit lot luck life think good loving family great friend girlfriend wa peak life last year finishing college job almost guaranteed wa recognized great worker wa making nice profit sport betting side project remember thinking great life wa going like amp x200b wa kicked college basically screwed early year bad grade written arrangement college prove good grade many formal meeting sueing within college lawyer student right refuse whatever reason regardless grade job wa student job government wa terminated since student wa obligatory week later friend mine spill water 4000 laptop contest lose side project sport betting amp x200b optimistic guy could name thousand example recently trying get life back track get sidelined reason starting make sense past two year lost 4 family member unexpectedly able say goodbye fast gone able put aside self reflect make feel later recently everything try invest falling apart really starting believe something someone push make lose everything scared everyday action opening letter nightmare think bad news driving crazy want upset girlfriend next step wa family job try look optimistic scared shitless every time try get back get kicked flight stair reasonable logic guy fucking damnit odds everything happening simply circumstance running fake smile generic speech rough fine starting believe irrational thing afford hurt effort pay anywhere thought slowly creeping struggling keep

"I am a TOTAL FAILURE. Long rant ahead, had to get it off my chest.","I grew up with a very optimistic perspective on the future. I had dreams, hopes and aspirations and I was always validated by the people around me for being 'special'. I am not fucking special. I never was.

&amp;nbsp;

I cannot believe how much of a loser I am. Two years ago, when I got my degree, I was in awe. I thought that was the solution to my issues. I thought I would be successful in life and that everything would eventually turn out fine. College was extremely stressful and traumatic and I really had high hopes for the future, hopes of having better and more enjoyable times ahead of me. Once I got out of college I was hit by the realization that I wasn't particularly skilled at anything. And I didn't enjoy anything either. Also, soon enough, I realized that my degree was useless and that it wasn't going to help me in finding a good job. I eventually got my first job two years ago, shortly after graduating. It was a shitty retail job at a local store. I hated the guts out of it and I was treated like garbage by everyone because I was always overly-emotional and fucked up a lot. I left that job but was unable to find something better. I eventually settled for another average job, working for a casino. Still minimum wage and lots of stress but at least I had a better schedule and it allowed me to ""self-improve"" (or that's what I thought at the time, lol). I've been working there for a year and a half and I've hated **every second** of it. I got to see the dark side of people and addiction in general...people spending their last penny on slot machines, people breaking down in tears, smashing stuff around them, swearing and even threatening me for their lack of self-control. Now I'm searching for a different job but my shit degree doesn't qualify me for anything except for being a teacher, which I've realized that I would hate doing (I've done it for a short period when I was in college and hated it with a passion). 

&amp;nbsp;

I hate everything, but I hate myself even more. I am a **LOSER**, I am no one. I can't seem to muster up the motivation to do something with my life. I always made plans to start an online course or even try to get a better degree, but I always cancelled those plans because I'm too much of a coward. Also my ability to learn things pretty much plummeted in college, when I was barely able to get through 2 pages without wanting to kill myself. I wish I had a valid fucking reason for being such a failure but I have nothing to say in my defense. Every single time I tried to do something to better myself, I failed miserably and only proved myself that I'm a fucking disaster who will never get anything out of life. Right now I'm struggling with driving school and I almost crashed into another car yesterday during practice. I have never heard of anyone struggling so much with driving school, yet here I am, being unable to do basic things such as learning a course or driving a fucking car. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've been severely depressed and suicidal for years. Mental illness robbed me of a happy, normal life. I've been unable to have a realtionship or maintain healthy, normal long term frienships because I have the emotional maturity of a 5 year old. I've been on dozens of SSRIs and generally a lot of med combos that only fucked me up even more. Therapy hasn't helped a bit either, and it only fucked me up more because I spent so much money on therapy in the past few years. I could have done so much more if I hadn't wasted it on something that never helped anyway. The past few monts were rough. I made plans to kill myself but again, I was too much of a coward to actually go through it (and my previous unsuccesful attempt discouraged me too much). So instead I ended up getting drunk every night, crying myself to sleep then continuing to get high throughout the day. I constantly wanted to call in sick to work and while I was at work I actually called my boss to ask if I could go to the pharma during the shift because I couldn't take the pain anymore. I would constantly fuck myself up on Xanax, it was the only way I could get through work. I almost ended up at the ER because of my lifestyle. I haven't eaten a cooked meal in weeks (all I've been eating is potato chips and junk food). I had a mental breakdown and ended up cutting my long hair, smashing random objects around the house, and contemplating suicide by sitting on my balcony at 4 AM, wanting to jump but not doing it out of fear (also, pretty much i wouldn't have died from such a low height, but the impulse was still present). I just don't know what to do. I know many will tell me to seek help, but I did seek help multiple times and I'm still a wreck. I do not deserve help, because I am too much of an  idiot to even be alive. I just want to sleep and never wake up again.

"I can't quit contemplating suicide, and the thought of my future only makes it worse. I obviously cannot stop thinking of the future in the immediate present without a good sum of damage being done to, well, my future... so it's self-perpetuating. I can't take that much more.","Let's start with modern events. My mother was in the CIA and not only had she given me a supreme love and appreciation for what they do, she has shown me how much they give up to do it -- they give up, on some level, their freedom so that others can have theirs. This damages their sense of self so badly that they can develop mixed depression, anxiety, PTSD and BPD as well as NPD on top of it. Imagine having that as your mother, no matter how understandable the reasoning behind it is. Seeing certain aspects of her job crushed and used politically for either side actually damages a part of my self-identity, as I often used them as a standard for myself to measure up to as I've inherited many of her less beneficial traits **and** acquired PTSD from her (and my school's) treatment of me.

Alone, it's a huge weight to bear -- my past, for better and worse. However, remember how I said I had inherited many of her less beneficial traits? I'm autistic. I have ADHD. I have major depressive disorder, as well as anxiety on top. I also have PTSD. These things *prevent* me from working -- from taking proper instruction, from learning like everyone else, to even handling certain objects because of their texture or how they sound or feel (I would rather be NAKED than have sand in my boots, for example, and I will take my clothing off instead of 'dealing with' the sensations, they're so unbearable.)

I also have an IQ of... I think, 163 as tested when I was around 7. I'm AWARE of all of this. I'm trapped in some weird sack of meat that doesn't cooperate with me. I share a symbiotic relationship with it, and I love it dearly, but it's just so heart-breaking to have so many people expect so much of me because of a number everyone -- supposedly -- assumes is meaningless for good reason. They ignore, for example, the fact I even can wound myself so badly with a single centimeter-deep gash that the floor is covered in blood. It really would have been nice if the people in my past took my advice and just let me get a lethal dose of morphine to put an end to my suffer, but I'm so afraid now that my future is solely me as either a hunter-gatherer -- illegal -- or me as a criminal, the likes of which have died early or hurt so many people because of their cunning. If I am meant to be a sacrifice, can you at least make it quick...? Not a 21-year endeavor...?

Edit: I'm 21 years old, but I understood my trajectory when I was 11. I want/ed it to end; Imagine knowing it's going to end with you starving to death if someone doesn't come by and put you out of your misery and/or let you do it yourself. A pill is so much more peaceful and humane, and yet everyone stands and postures about humanitarianism. Are you, though?

I've given up on being happy.,"As a 21M virgin, I know I'll never be happy. I missed out on the time of my life when I'm supposed to have no responsibilities, experience love, and not have to worry about anything. Instead, I spent my childhood in my room crying about unfair everything is. I will never get that time back unless they somehow invent time machines in my lifetime, which I of course doubt. Everyone told me to just feel proud of my academic achievements and the fact that I'm smart and can do anything. Except none of my academic accomplishments stopped me from developing suicidal ideation and depression.

In all honesty, I just want people to stop trying to save me. I know I'm broken. At this point, I don't even think the love or physical intimacy of a woman could fix me. A therapist or meds definitely couldn't. How could someone who hasn't wanted to be a virgin for 7-8 years still be one after all this time? To everyone that thinks I shouldn't kill myself, seriously answer that question. What does the fact that I've been a virgin this long, without ever wanting to, say about me as a person?

I'll tell you what it says, it says that I've never deserved to be loved at any point in my life. That puts me in the same league as rapists, murderers, and a plethora of horrible people who also clearly don't deserve the love of another person. If it's not that, what else could it be? Would you rather blame the entire female population instead of me? That's a coward's way out of accepting personal responsibility. The fact of the matter is I don't deserve to be loved, and it's all my fault. Everyone with a brain would say I'm a pathetic loser who didn't do enough, and it's true. So why save me?

I started to pull over but he kept going and yelled something while pointing over. So I guess he was telling me to get in the slow lane. And on top of that I forgot to get money from the bank and get gas so now my car is next to empty. Fuck. I’m such a fucking idiot.

"Death is inescapable. Out of all the ways to die, a quick suicide is the least painful.","Seriously, why do people think they’re doing something helpful by talking a person out of suicide? They’re telling them to trade in the *least* painful way of dying for a slower, more painful way of dying (cancer, old age, organ failure, violent accident, etc.). 
If a person is driven to the point of suicide, they **clearly** don’t have a rewarding life that would make such an exchange worth it.

Help I need to get tested for mental illness before i kill myself,"I am scared of death but my parents treat me like a piece of shit and I want death

.They are homophobic and transphobic so when I  show emotion they say man up.They are religious (we will get in to that later).They also work helping the mentally ill.The last thing you need to know is my parents were fighting for 5 years now and got divorced a year ago (me and my sister live in 2 houses)

&amp;#x200B;

For me I felt terrible about 2 years ago and when my parents got a divorce I felt suicidal.1 month ago I took  a deep breath and told my mom im always stressed and suicidal.My dad is very religous so if I told him he would just talk about god being on my side.I told my mom that while they are not abusive they scream at me a lot and say we are dissapointments but then tell us (me and my sister) ok now get good grades and become rich (remeber im only 11 and she is 13).My mom said that I need to take deep breaths and remeber life will get tough but you have to keep those thoughts out your mind.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom in her life went through a lot of stress during the divorce in particular because she had to refinance the house and got no help from my dad.She thought of suicide one day but got over it quick with thinking god can help me.So  i said deep breaths help but it is not a cure.Word for Word I said ""I think i need to get tested for anxiety.""She snapped saying you control and you do not have a mental illness."" This because she works with people so close to killing themself they are taken seriously or people with Schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.I took a doctors approved test from the mayo clinic saying i score 18 out of 21 on the anxiety scale and i have severe anxiety snd 20 out of 28 on the deppresion scale also severe.

&amp;#x200B;

My moms thinking is that people confirmed to have deppresion or anxiety have gone through things like losing a loved one or divorce witch are causes.It is also confirmed that your parents getting divorced is also a cause (which probably caused it if i do have it.)So at this point if I cant get treated why live just so i can suffer.If anyone has a way for me to mabye get therapy or even tested by a doctor please tell me in the comments.

Sometimes I daydream about killing myself at work,"Well, I’ve been working from home since March but sometimes I daydream about going back into the office and killing myself in the bathroom because this job is destroying my health, I’m so stressed out everyday and I’m so burnt out that my suicidal thoughts have gotten way worse since a couple of months ago.

 Today I couldn’t stop hysterically crying in bed and I alternate between sitting in front of my laptop unable to do tasks because there’s a million things to be done but my brain feels absolutely fried and unfocused. Can’t get support because everyone seems to be in the same position and we’re very much understaffed but company seems to hate hiring new people even though multiple people have left in the team all at once.  

It’s either that or I’m so angry and frustrated that I start punching/throwing stuff around the house, stabbing objects at home with scissors, or screaming into my pillow. I know that sounds completely crazy, but this job is wrecking me. I know I need to quit as I’ve been completely dissatisfied with my job for some time and this career is 100% not right for me, but it’s so hard to get the mental energy to start applying for jobs not to mention the whole COVID situation and unemployment rates. 

I did take stress leave but my manager kept calling and texting me to “check in” and it honestly just made me feel even more stressed. My therapist thinks I need at least a month break to recover from my burn out but I don’t have that much sick pay. 

To be honest sometimes I do grab a rope and tie it around my neck and seriously consider saying my goodbyes and just going through with it at home.

Life is not worth living when you are tied down by responsibilities,"Its really not worth waking up to see the next day when you have depression, but at the same time have responsibilities to other people that force you to make personal sacrifices. 

Why should I continue? The pain of my family is not enough to keep me around for them. When every goddamn day I have to fight everything in my goddamn brain to try to feel like life is actually a good experience and that there is actual reason to be happy, and even then, I don't actually feel it. I don't actually believe it. And it's starting to seem like a cruel joke that I am even alive in the first place. 

I'm just not cut out for life. I don't feel motivated by all of these challenges. I don't feel good. Calling the problems with life ""challenges"" is just too fucking child like. It makes life sound like a game. Well life isn't a fucking game. I'm fucking sick and tired of having to put on a fucking act and try to FORCE myself to just BE DIFFERENT, to fucking BE HAPPY, to APPRECIATE SHIT. 

But I just can't keep doing this.

I can't keep trying to force myself to smile and use body language/facial expressions.

I can't keep trying to physically speak normally.

I can't keep trying to remember all the shit that goes on in the day. 

I can't keep trying to call myself down. I can't keep trying to constantly manage my own emotions.

I can't keep trying to fix what is wrong with me. 

I can't keep forcing myself and inevitably failing to hold real genuine interest in shit.

I can't keep trying to force myself to just STAY FUCkING FOCUSED.

I can't try to fucking ""grind"" anymore. I understand that this is THE reason I will never recover if I become homeless, but I just can't do it again man. I can't deal with a lifestyle of constant work and forced health sacrifices such as a lack of quality sleep. It doesn't matter for how fucking temporary that situation is, I CANNOT ABIDE IT, I CANNOT try it again. I can't. Having to plan everything out...just goddamit...it doesn't matter what the purpose is or what it's for. I would just kill myself out of the sheer lack of time to just bullshit.

I knew it was a bad idea to try to talk to my mom about my darkness,The last few days have been hell for me. I figured to try to reach out to my mom just as a cry for help.I have been debating if I should talk or not. Kept hinting I wanted to talk. My mind was in a very dark place. We eventually get onto Facebook after texting (too deep to talk on person). I had briefly just mentioned i was in a mental dark place. Thats all I said. I didnt say anything about suicide. Supposedly that was too much. She goes on and just doesnt say anything. Now I feel like that was not a good idea. Now I remember why I keep all my feelings to myself. It sucks.

I don't think I am going to make it,"This is going to be my last Reddit post for a while. 

I've been planning my 21st birthday for a while, but I realized that it will probably not happen. I won't make it to 21. I have 59 days left and I'm trying so hard but I don't think I can do it. I don't even have friends to invite if I wanted to. I really thought I was going to have a party that people would want to attend. People don't even like me. My family doesn't even like me. 

I am a burden. Not only to society but to myself. Does that make sense? I burden myself but existing. I haven't accomplished anything in my life worth noting. A burden. 

I remember as a child thinking how cool it would be to turn 21. I dreamt about the dress I would wear, the friends I would have, the places I would go to. But it was all a dream. 

I have nothing to live for. I have nothing to aspire to. I contribute nothing to the world. 

I don't think I am being a coward though. It takes a lot of strength to come to these terms. And for that, I am proud of myself. I am also proud of how long I lasted. I never thought I would reach 18. But I can't do this anymore. 

I don't have any hope for myself and that's okay.

"If it weren’t for my son, and step daughter, I would have done it by now.","I’ve had depression, and anxiety since I was maybe 14 years old, and a drinking problem since I was 17 or so. 

My parents have always been supportive, and I’ve been talking to therapists, and doctors since then. I’m 29 now. 

I’ve been able to take care of all my appointments and meds since about 23, because I make really good money even without insurance. My dad helped me open up my own company, and we do really well. 

5 years ago, I hired a secretary. We immediately fell for each other, and she quit so we could be together. 

A little over 2 years ago, we got married, and now we have a 1 year old son, and her 6 year old daughter. My wife makes great money in real estate. 

About a year ago, we bought our forever house. 

Everything seems really fucking great for me right? 

I hate my life. Every day is a struggle to keep the wheels turning. Between running a business, and taking care of kids until they go to sleep, always fixing shit around the house, and paying bills, I’ve got no energy left. 

All of these issues were manageable about 6 months ago, when business was booming in my industry, but covid fucked that all up. 

Now everything is a nightmare. I go to work every day, and check my email first thing. No new work coming in. Then I realize I have to pay all the business expenses. I check quick books to make sure we have the money before i cut checks. The account is draining fast. I panic, and it makes things worse. I pay the bills, then think about which employee I’m going to have to lay off at the end of the week. Not fun. 

My wife then texts me about how the boards on the deck are rotting, and we need to replace them. Great, $400 down the drain, and a Saturday lost. Oh, and that big oak tree in the back has some kind of fungus. It’ll be $900 to treat, but it might not work, but we can split it. Then the lot next to us gets bought, and they cut all the trees down that we’re giving us privacy. $500 in trees for the fence line. 

My main customer calls me and says we need to talk, and he’s coming by Monday at 1. I already know what it’s about. “Since oilfield is shit now, we are cutting all existing orders”. 

My wife makes good money, and I used to, but don’t anymore, so we get denied for daycare assistance. They pulled paystubs for a year instead of accounting for lost wages because of covid. We are fucked. $300 a week for both.

In the past 6 months, my AC has gone out in my car, $2700, my engine seized, under warranty, but about 60 hours of work arguing to get them to honor it lawyers involved and everything $1500. 
The new dog we got won’t stop pissing on everything, so I had to take her back to the shelter. It broke my heart. We had her about 3 months, and I worked with her every day to train her (I brought her to work every day), be she just wouldn’t get it. Jumped up on the bare mattress, and peed. $2800 mattress. 

So alllllll of these stresses, and many more have contributed to me being a pretty depressed person lately. So my wife tells me last night she wants a divorce. I didn’t even cry, I just got in the car, and drove around with a beer for a little while. I thought about going home and getting my gun, and leaving again, but then i remembered. 

What kind of life are my son and daughter going to have if they have to live with the fact that their dad shot himself? The 6 year old would be devastated, 
And the 1 year old will grow up never knowing me. That’s not fair to them. 

I am so tired of this rat race, and so tired of being unhappy. It doesn’t matter how many nice things you have, or how much money you used to have. The only thing that matters is a solid state of mind to get through life. I don’t have that. 

I almost resent my kids for keeping me from leaving.

I’m just so tired, but there is no rest to be found in the foreseeable future.",throwaway618711,18,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jg9wly/if_it_werent_for_my_son_and_step_daughter_i_would/,depression anxiety since wa maybe 14 year old drinking problem since wa 17 parent always supportive talking therapist doctor since 29 able take care appointment med since 23 make really good money even without insurance dad helped open company really well 5 year ago hired secretary immediately fell quit could together little 2 year ago got married 1 year old son 6 year old daughter wife make great money real estate year ago bought forever house everything seems really fucking great right hate life every day struggle keep wheel turning running business taking care kid go sleep always fixing shit around house paying bill got energy left issue manageable 6 month ago business wa booming industry covid fucked everything nightmare go work every day check email first thing new work coming realize pay business expense check quick book make sure money cut check account draining fast panic make thing worse pay bill think employee going lay end week fun wife text board deck rotting need replace great 400 drain saturday lost oh big oak tree back ha kind fungus 900 treat might work split lot next u get bought cut tree giving u privacy 500 tree fence line main customer call say need talk coming monday 1 already know since oilfield shit cutting existing order wife make good money used anymore get denied daycare assistance pulled paystubs year instead accounting lost wage covid fucked 300 week past 6 month ac ha gone car 2700 engine seized warranty 60 hour work arguing get honor lawyer involved everything 1500 new dog got stop pissing everything take back shelter broke heart 3 month worked every day train brought work every day get jumped bare mattress peed 2800 mattress alllllll stress many contributed pretty depressed person lately wife tell last night want divorce even cry got car drove around beer little thought going home getting gun leaving remembered kind life son daughter going live fact dad shot 6 year old would devastated 1 year old grow never knowing fair tired rat race tired unhappy matter many nice thing much money used thing matter solid state mind get life almost resent kid keeping leaving sorry rambling nature post tired rest found foreseeable future,son step daughter would done,throwaway 618711,3884,73,throwaway 618711 depression anxiety since wa maybe 14 year old drinking problem since wa 17 parent always supportive talking therapist doctor since 29 able take care appointment med since 23 make really good money even without insurance dad helped open company really well 5 year ago hired secretary immediately fell quit could together little 2 year ago got married 1 year old son 6 year old daughter wife make great money real estate year ago bought forever house everything seems really fucking great right hate life every day struggle keep wheel turning running business taking care kid go sleep always fixing shit around house paying bill got energy left issue manageable 6 month ago business wa booming industry covid fucked everything nightmare go work every day check email first thing new work coming realize pay business expense check quick book make sure money cut check account draining fast panic make thing worse pay bill think employee going lay end week fun wife text board deck rotting need replace great 400 drain saturday lost oh big oak tree back ha kind fungus 900 treat might work split lot next u get bought cut tree giving u privacy 500 tree fence line main customer call say need talk coming monday 1 already know since oilfield shit cutting existing order wife make good money used anymore get denied daycare assistance pulled paystubs year instead accounting lost wage covid fucked 300 week past 6 month ac ha gone car 2700 engine seized warranty 60 hour work arguing get honor lawyer involved everything 1500 new dog got stop pissing everything take back shelter broke heart 3 month worked every day train brought work every day get jumped bare mattress peed 2800 mattress alllllll stress many contributed pretty depressed person lately wife tell last night want divorce even cry got car drove around beer little thought going home getting gun leaving remembered kind life son daughter going live fact dad shot 6 year old would devastated 1 year old grow never knowing fair tired rat race tired unhappy matter many nice thing much money used thing matter solid state mind get life almost resent kid keeping leaving sorry rambling nature post tired rest found foreseeable future son step daughter would done
Suicidal thoughts are eating me up and I can't get help,".... Because if I try to get help and tell the truth about my very advanced and concrete plans for suicide, I'll be committed against my will.

This very nearly happened to me some years back, when a doctor thought I was making up stories about assault to cover up self harm, and it was deeply traumatizing.

I'd absolutely, truly die before going through that again, and it seems to me there's no point in attempting to get help when I can't tell the truth to any therapist or doctor, so I'm left to my own devices.

Wouldn't be so bad if I didn't suck at this suiicde thing, I've had four serious attempts since the New Year, and I am obviously and unfortunately still stuck here and can't get out in either direction (these directions being death or getting better).

Toxic positivity,"I just got on here and encountered some message about “ list three positive things” since you got up today.  I really wanted to use this post to make a sarcastic point, but it got deleted.  I appreciate wanting to wring the neck of overly positive individuals who minimize and really don’t understand the the dark intractability of suicidal depression, but hey... they probably wanted to help and it would have been nice to unload some invective reality on their Norman Rockwell therapist comment.  I guess I understand moderators trying to keep the space safe, and hopefully a place where people can get some perspective on this real and pressing topic.  On the other hand, why not let a little stirring of the pot occur?  Speaking from my sliver of experience, sometimes it’s therapeutic to go face to face with a real neophyte who has some Disney interpretation of life.  Anyway.  That post was redacted by the time I saw it, so whatever.  It might have been fun though to enact that argument in a venue full of people who have heard it all before. Just saying.  Love you all.

I’ve lost everything that matters to me.,"Looking back on the last six years of my adult life I often wonder where I went wrong, and why someone like me, who is constantly told how smart, attractive, and capable I am, deserves the life I am living now. At what point during this period of my life where I am supposed to be flourishing socially, with my education, and relationships, did I fail so miserably to find myself where I am today? I often ask myself this every day. Why me? Why do I deserve to be kicked around like a stone by life? It all seemed so good four years ago. I met a girl that accepted me for who I was. Eventually, we fell in love. Marriage, kids, and conversations about a future together followed soon after. At 21 I was married, owned a home, was headed back to pursue my education, and I had just bought a beautiful new truck. I had a job that paid generously. I had... everything. Everything I wanted at least. Then my Grandpa passed away. My Dad cheated on my Mom. I gained weight. I hated myself, I neglected to give the girl that gave me her all, all of me. Fast forward three years and I am a 24 year old divorcee who is 12k in debt. I live with a parent who has been generous to provide a roof over my head following the depression that has lurked over me since the divorce. But regardless I don’t feel any stability. It took me three years to find myself a job in a field I have experience in. I sit here writing this with a full time job, a new girl that seems to love me, always just a text away; and a glim hope for my future. Yet, I’m the midst of all the possibilities I see for myself, I can’t seem to understand why I don’t see a purpose for me here on earth. Wouldn’t not existing be easier than to deal with all of this anxiety? I continue to try to make a path for myself in this crazy world, but every time I see a slight glimpse of light, it’s always followed by darkness.

I'm not sure how much longer I can keep this up,"Every day I wake up, get ready for work and put on a happy face right before I walk in the door to see my coworkers but im always thinking about going home later that night and taking my 12 gauge under my chin and pulling the trigger. I've been like this since I was about 13 (I'm 22 now) when 2 of my older brothers were successful with suicide and later that same year my grandfather who was like the father I never had past away from cancer and I felt alone in this world with an verbally and sometimes physically abusive mother. I'm currently in a relationship and she's the only person that makes me happy and feel normal but she's also so busy with her life which is understandable that I don't get to talk to her that often and I sure as hell don't talk to her about my suicidal problems as I don't want to scare her off. As I'm sitting here on the edge of my bed, I have a loaded gun on my nightstand and I'm honestly ready to just end everything. My life started falling apart again in March earlier this year after I got laid off from my job where I was more than able to provide for myself and not need anything from anyone and now I'm back in my mothers house across the country where I don't know anyone and my mother is married to a 22 year old that I went to high school with. 
I always feel so drained mentally that I just want to end it all. I'm feeling like if things don't change soon I'm going to put a bullet in my head and call it a day. The only thing that's really stopped me so far is my girlfriend and my little sister who lives here with my mother as well (she's 7) and I don't want her to be the one to find me and have to live with the same fucked up perspective on life as I have.

My goodbye,"I’ve thought about this for awhile now and I just need help on how To end it.

I never thought I would be one of the people that would end up writings these.

I’ve came to the conclusion that I’m never gonna be shit 

My mom says it to me, my teachers have said it damn even a homeless man said it to me. 
I don’t know I just don’t feel loved. I never felt the love and I don’t think I ever will.
I’ve been getting kicked out the house since I turned 15. I just don’t feel the love. My mom is a miserable neat freak that acts bipolar and likes to worry about the little things to avoid bigger things in her life...I try and stay out late as possible so I don’t have to hear the regret in my mothers voice I’m not writing this letter to make people feel bad for me. I’m writing this letter because you could never truthfully know what goes on at home. Just a simple bit of love and affection could go along way. Sorry I didn’t make smarter decisions but I’m not sorry for having to get high and drink to feel okay and loved... you know I might as well tell you one of my deepest secrets I’ve never been ables to tell Someone I love them. I think that shit is fake... I wish that everyone I was close with live a long, prosperous, healthy and loving life....
At one point I tried to better myself be more positive and show sympathy for others and I did just that people started to ask me why was I so positive and happy through the negatives and it was that I started to hate myself I started to feel miserable and disgusted of myself and it made me change how I seen myself then one day I posted a YOLO and I instantly started to get so much hate I never thought I would see the day where being nice and polite to people would would bring out the worst i someone I thought if I gave out love and kindness to others that I would receive nothing but the same back it turned out I was wrong and that’s how ended up here... and my mother is a manipulator she is not as innocent as she seems she claims to be a saint but talks down on all of her kids, her friends and family right behind closed doors.....

I honestly don't know to get better.,"So, to start off I come from a decently wealthy household (We have a bigger than average house and have 2 nice cars). My dad works constantly and I can never talk to him and when I do talk to him it somehow sidetracks into me being a disappointment and how I won't be as good as my brother. Even when I was younger I barely got any attention from him because it was always between my brother with special needs and my other brother who took interest with my father's work, so anytime I do something I feel like I will never be good as my brother. The real problem is/was my mother. My mother on a good day wouldn't be drunk or high at 1:00 pm. She would hit me constantly and got my brothers to join in and I still have scars on my back from when I got pushed to the ground and was kicked it the back and the stomach for a little while. She has done things to purposefully spite me and destroys my dad's bank account leading to screaming matches between my parents. The worst part about my mother is that I now somewhere under the alcohol, drugs, and medications she's on, she does still care a bit and now the reason she treats me like that is because of her own traumatic childhood. I was never really about to make friends due my mother cutting my self esteem to nothing and the friend I did make swindled me out of money due to my family being decently wealthy. Now I don't know what to do. I have no real motivations and no passion for really anything and I'll be honest. I hurt my self and I've stepped into a noose and the only reason why I'm writing this is because the makeshift noose broke. I still thinking on taking myself out, but I thought about writing this because I don't about my problems to people. So I feel a bit better.

Excited to kill myself,"So I'm having this thoughts about killing myself for more than 5 years now. I'm 23 and I never felt happy, and I can't even find a reason for it. I'm handsome, funny, got the University diploma even though nobody really believed in my or support me, never really experienced any big issues In my life, sure I had downs, breakups and financial difficulties but I can't find the reason why I'm so desperate to end my life. I guess this is crying for help or support, does anyone else experience this happiness rush while thinking of suicide or just dying in general?

Just in case anybody asks, I do have friends and family but nobody really takes me seriously when I'm trying to talk about it. Most common answer is don't be stupid. It will pass. Well it's been at least 10 years since I have felt truly happy. And i tried making money, going out as well as the opposite, living with minimum effort and staying at home. The only thing I like to do is play video games. 

It's killing me when people say that they are jealous of my life, I fucking hate it. Im not afraid of changing it but there is nothing that improved it so far and I tried many things. Im thinking about suicide more and more often. To the point that the thought alone calms me and excites me.

I took care of my sibling when I was young myself. I'm quite mature for my age so don't think I can't handle emotions.

Death,"I have no options left. I cant do this. I was such a lucky kid, my mom bought me a car before my 16th birthday in order for me to start driving it, then I totaled it. Then I got deep into drugs and depression and went to a mental hospital.

The only thing worse than staying alive right now would be a failed attempt,My best friend/girlfriend would probably hate me for trying to leave her and she’s the only person in the world I truly need. My parents would be heartbroken so I’d have to watch their suffering AND they’d never trust me to do anything alone ever again. I’d miss a shit ton of school and might even have to repeat the year. My classmates would think I’m an attention seeker. Even the seemingly minor detail that I’d probably have to throw up the pills and I have severe emetophobia. All this would obviously make me feel way worse than before but access to everything I could “try again” with would be gone. God. There’s another way I could do it that’s more guaranteed but I wouldn’t want my parents to find me that way.,fleetwoodwack-33,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jg8w9o/the_only_thing_worse_than_staying_alive_right_now/,best friend girlfriend would probably hate trying leave person world truly need parent would heartbroken watch suffering never trust anything alone ever miss shit ton school might even repeat year classmate would think attention seeker even seemingly minor detail probably throw pill severe emetophobia would obviously make feel way worse access everything could try would gone god another way could guaranteed want parent find way,thing worse staying alive right would failed attempt,fleetwood wac k 33,721,75,fleetwood wac k 33 best friend girlfriend would probably hate trying leave person world truly need parent would heartbroken watch suffering never trust anything alone ever miss shit ton school might even repeat year classmate would think attention seeker even seemingly minor detail probably throw pill severe emetophobia would obviously make feel way worse access everything could try would gone god another way could guaranteed want parent find way thing worse staying alive right would failed attempt

"""I don't believe in luck! I create my own luck!"". Most people seriously underestimate how luck plays a BIG/HUGE factor in life.","A friend of mine used to tweet a phrase that always sticks with me: ""Some people are lucky, some people are not."" That was some years ago, and the more I live now, the more I see (&amp; realized/learned) that it's true. Most people seriously underestimate how luck plays a BIG/HUGE factor in their lives. Or in life, for all that matters. I don't know and I'm not sure if it's due to the meritocracy thing (""If you work hard, you WILL succeed/reach success!""), or if it's due to the 'positive/optimistic' self-help culture/trend/hype that is literally almost everywhere nowadays, etc etc. But I think it's very naive, simplistic, &amp; ignorant if people seriously believe that they control ALL and EVERY aspect of their life/lives. 

Even the reddit posts that will get popular &amp; many upvotes, and other posts that get almost no vote/comment or even banned/deleted (even though when they're really good posts, but sadly just very underrated or underappreciated), it also has the 'luck' factor in it. And as a result (or even the fatal consequences), no wonder some redditors in this reddit (or subreddit) will feel even more alone, unloved, nobody cares, and some of them will probably even decide to be 'gone forever' by committing suicide. 

But back to the main point again: if you really think much more deeper, you will see that it's all random (yes, somewhat nihilistic). Some people will win, &amp; some people will lose. Some people will survive &amp; live, while some people will die. I always view our human species just like those little ants: There are billions of them on this planet, and some will get crushed &amp; die, while some other will survive &amp; live. That's basically our human life too. In fact, it's ALL lives in this universe. Some will live; Some will die. 

Lastly, it's the same thing with all of us here who are depressed &amp; suicidal. You take a look at all your other friends, family, colleagues, or people, and how they somehow are happy, or even successful, and then you think: ""Why I can't be like that too?"", even though you've tried or even work really hard. And then even when you eventually see how some of us in this reddit (or subreddit) can finally recover, cured, healed, &amp; finally lead a normal, happy, &amp; successful life too, it will make you think the same again: ""Why I can't be like them?"". 

I don't know if it's god, karma, universe, destiny, fate, or just simply pure random chances. But to say that you don't believe in luck, playing at least SOME aspects/parts in your life, that's just naive, ignorant, &amp; too simple-minded. People who said that probably haven't truly 'open their eyes &amp; wake-up' to reality.",nikiwonoto,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jfxbh9/i_dont_believe_in_luck_i_create_my_own_luck_most/,friend mine used tweet phrase always stick people lucky people wa year ago live see amp realized learned true people seriously underestimate luck play big huge factor life life matter know sure due meritocracy thing work hard succeed reach success due positive optimistic self help culture trend hype literally almost everywhere nowadays etc etc think naive simplistic amp ignorant people seriously believe control every aspect life life even reddit post get popular amp many upvotes post get almost vote comment even banned deleted even though really good post sadly underrated underappreciated also ha luck factor result even fatal consequence wonder redditors reddit subreddit feel even alone unloved nobody care probably even decide gone forever committing suicide back main point really think much deeper see random yes somewhat nihilistic people win amp people lose people survive amp live people die always view human specie like little ant billion planet get crushed amp die survive amp live basically human life fact life universe live die lastly thing u depressed amp suicidal take look friend family colleague people somehow happy even successful think like even though tried even work really hard even eventually see u reddit subreddit finally recover cured healed amp finally lead normal happy amp successful life make think like know god karma universe destiny fate simply pure random chance say believe luck playing least aspect part life naive ignorant amp simple minded people said probably truly open eye amp wake reality,believe luck create luck people seriously underestimate luck play big huge factor life,niki,2686,127,niki friend mine used tweet phrase always stick people lucky people wa year ago live see amp realized learned true people seriously underestimate luck play big huge factor life life matter know sure due meritocracy thing work hard succeed reach success due positive optimistic self help culture trend hype literally almost everywhere nowadays etc etc think naive simplistic amp ignorant people seriously believe control every aspect life life even reddit post get popular amp many upvotes post get almost vote comment even banned deleted even though really good post sadly underrated underappreciated also ha luck factor result even fatal consequence wonder redditors reddit subreddit feel even alone unloved nobody care probably even decide gone forever committing suicide back main point really think much deeper see random yes somewhat nihilistic people win amp people lose people survive amp live people die always view human specie like little ant billion planet get crushed amp die survive amp live basically human life fact life universe live die lastly thing u depressed amp suicidal take look friend family colleague people somehow happy even successful think like even though tried even work really hard even eventually see u reddit subreddit finally recover cured healed amp finally lead normal happy amp successful life make think like know god karma universe destiny fate simply pure random chance say believe luck playing least aspect part life naive ignorant amp simple minded people said probably truly open eye amp wake reality believe luck create luck people seriously underestimate luck play big huge factor life

Off my chest/ vent,"Long story short I decided enough is enough &amp; tonight is the night. I’m tired of feeling like a burden to my family and Society. 

I ran away from home a few days ago after getting into a quarrel with my father and have been homeless in my car since then. I skipped work yesterday (no call/ no show) because my head has been so fogged I can’t think straight 

I’ve dealt with mental health issues on and off since high school when my mom passed (in my early 20’s now). I’ve been trying to get a grip on life to move out and get my own place like most people my age. But I just keep slipping up just when I think my mindset was in the right direction. 

My family insists to take my time to get my life together before moving out, but I always feel as I am taking too long. I know my dad and his wife want to move back to their hometown to live with their folks for their remaining years, but I know I’m the reason from keeping them to do so.  

I also wasted my fathers money last year getting admitted to an outpatient therapy program which helped for a bit but now I’m back to square one 

It is quite sad that it was easier for me to buy a gun on my 21rst birthday than buying a beer at a bar( bars don’t allow vertical ID but gun shops do?!??)And I’ve bought a second gun none-the less. You would think with the mental health awareness, you’d think it would be a challenge for someone fucked up as myself to buy a firearm, but nope it’s almost as easy as buying candy

TLDR; I plan on calling in a swat team for a fake situation that didn’t happen, &amp; hope the officers take my life as  I raise my (not- loaded)firearm towards them (my gun will be empty because I’d never want to harm anyone else but myself and just want to use it to persuade them that I’m a threat) 

I plan on going this route since I’m too much of a coward to do it myself. I will of course be under the influence of my favorite drug; ambien, so I won’t feel a thing (hopefully)",amd6654,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgdvee/off_my_chest_vent/,long story short decided enough enough amp tonight night tired feeling like burden family society ran away home day ago getting quarrel father homeless car since skipped work yesterday call show head ha fogged think straight dealt mental health issue since high school mom passed early 20 trying get grip life move get place like people age keep slipping think mindset wa right direction family insists take time get life together moving always feel taking long know dad wife want move back hometown live folk remaining year know reason keeping also wasted father money last year getting admitted outpatient therapy program helped bit back square one quite sad wa easier buy gun 21rst birthday buying beer bar bar allow vertical id gun shop bought second gun none le would think mental health awareness think would challenge someone fucked buy firearm nope almost easy buying candy tldr plan calling swat team fake situation happen amp hope officer take life raise loaded firearm towards gun empty never want harm anyone else want use persuade threat plan going route since much coward course influence favorite drug ambien feel thing hopefully,chest vent,amd 6654,1960,18,amd 6654 long story short decided enough enough amp tonight night tired feeling like burden family society ran away home day ago getting quarrel father homeless car since skipped work yesterday call show head ha fogged think straight dealt mental health issue since high school mom passed early 20 trying get grip life move get place like people age keep slipping think mindset wa right direction family insists take time get life together moving always feel taking long know dad wife want move back hometown live folk remaining year know reason keeping also wasted father money last year getting admitted outpatient therapy program helped bit back square one quite sad wa easier buy gun 21rst birthday buying beer bar bar allow vertical id gun shop bought second gun none le would think mental health awareness think would challenge someone fucked buy firearm nope almost easy buying candy tldr plan calling swat team fake situation happen amp hope officer take life raise loaded firearm towards gun empty never want harm anyone else want use persuade threat plan going route since much coward course influence favorite drug ambien feel thing hopefully chest vent

Multiple DUIs. I want to die.,"So, unless I slip through the cracks (again), I could be facing my 3rd or 4th DUI. Both are felonies and the 4th is loss of license for life along with prison time. I’ll be 40 years old in one month. 

Contrary to the above, I’m not a raging alcoholic. It’s been 9y8mo since my last DUI but because I got another before the 10 years was up they could charge me with the 3rd or 4th (if they find the DUIs from my previous state.) I’ve only ever had one accident and that was my first DUI. All others have been simply pulled over or me trying to sleep it off in my car. 

If this 3rd or 4th happens I will mostly likely take my own life as I can no longer live in society. The temptation is too strong and too accessible for me to overcome. The punishment is too strict for me to live with. 

Aside from the above, I’m just miserable as a whole. I’m not a great person but I REALLY want to be and have wanted to be my entire life. Something has always been off though. 

I have an 8 year old son who I share custody of. My girlfriend and I own a house and her 9 year old son lives with us full time. She is very successful and her son is very smart. My only fear of suicide is hurting them and my immediate family. 

But... I just can’t live with myself. I feel like suicide will be temporary pain and people will go about their lives. If I don’t commit suicide then I will cause more pain to those I love throughout the rest of my miserable life. 

I’m dead set on ending everything and have already come to terms. At this point I’m narrowing down the methods and finding out how much this will cost if, or when, I do it. If I get a 1st offense DUI then I will try my hardest to restructure myself and refrain from suicide for the time being. 

I’m not an emotional person but I’ve cried more the past two weeks than I have in the past 10 years.

I just tried to kill myself. 18M,"
I have held a wire around my neck for about 2 minutes and I lost consciousness and 30 minutes after I have woken up and decided to write this


It all started about a year ago, my grandfather got diagnosed with a heart issue and he's been superweak since then. Back then I always had a person I would consider a lifelong friend, he would be there supporting me but situation has gone far worse for me and here is why:

- my parents have almot stopped to support me in anyway, they pulled me out of a top-tier private college here in spain without letting me know. They barely care about whats about me and it seems as if my personal success produces them hate.

-I havent seen my grandfather in a long time due to my father broken relationship with him, I know his situation has gone critical lasts weeks because I call my grandma. I cant afford loosing one of the most important person in my life right now and Im afraid because of covid I will not even be able to see him again.

- lately I've been feeling alone, I dont think its the typical teenager shit of wow im so deep,  but a real feel of loneliness, as I've told that friend "" I feel as a fucking non playable character"". Im just tryna get back up again and I just need that special person to talk for a while and tell him, bro I dont wanna die today please help me.

The Story of My Life
I fell into depression in the winter. I began to use video games and the internet as my escape. I became depersonalized and derealized. And it has stayed this way up until now as I am lying in my bed as a senior. I’ve tried so hard, but I’m not strong enough.



Mom
I love you so so so much. I’m so sorry to put you through this. I know you can handle it though. Please stay strong for me. Thank you for raising me the way you did. You did such an amazing job even if you don’t think so. You are the best Mom anyone could ever ask for. I love you to the moon and back a gazillion times.



Dad
I’m sorry for being an asshole to you as my got nearer. You’re an amazing Dad and I hope I never gave you the message that I don’t love you. When I’ve treated you poorly it’s because my mental health is more than I can handle and I have to take my anger out somewhere. Anyways, I love you so much I’m so sorry to do this to you.



Thomas
I love you so much thanks for being such a great friend to me all of my life. I don’t know what it would have been like without you. I really mean it.

I Feel Like I'm A Failure.,"To be honest, deep down, I know I am a failure. I have no special traits nor do I have any hobbies nor interests. I don't do well in school because I'm lazy and the only reason I didn't kill myself yet is because I'm too scared. You can find any negative traits about a person and it would very well fit me. I'm asking for help, and please don't forward me to one of those suicide prevention hotlines, they don't work for me. For starters, I'm 16, Asian, and a male. I know being a 16 year old shouldn't come with this much problems and you might think I'm being overdramatic but this is my last hope. There are several problems with me, internal and external. For one, school. I don't do well in school because I'm lazy. I try my hardest and always tell myself that I'll do well this year, but every year it's always the same. Now, I have tons of homework piling up and I'm certainly not nearly close to my parents' expectations. The stress, the disappointment I feel within myself, the anger, the pain, it's unbearable. I'm not special, in any way, shape, or form. In fact, I might be way below average and that hurts. I've battled these thoughts for years, saying that I'll find something I love, find something I'm passionate about, but time is passing by and I've found nothing and accomplished nothing. I really feel like a failure, to the point where I've convinced myself that I am. I feel hopeless, alone, and forgotten. I can leave this place and no one would care. Also, it's not because of school that I'm like this, I just hate myself, I don't do anything well, I always mess things up. I'm desperate and I want this pain to stop. I feel like I'm trapped, and I just want to start over.

I really really want to end it all somehow,"Hello. My name is Benji, I’m 15 turning 16 in a month or so. I have this incredible urge to end it all, I’ve just been super uninterested in my passions lately, and kinda depressed. The main thing is, I suffer from severe anxiety, I can’t stop getting the feeling that my boyfriend doesn’t love me like I love him. I try to make sure that he does and I constantly say how much I appreciate him but when I say it too much it annoys him. He assures me that my paranoias are untrue but I Just really feel inside that he wishes he weren’t with me. We been dating on and off since mid last year, and only for the past month we’ve officially been together but I love him so so so much, probably because we’ve known eachother for much longer. I don’t know what to do. It just feels so satisfying to somehow choke myself. As I type this out, maybe it’s not such a good idea. But idk what to do. Another factor is that I’m very vocally anti racist on Twitter, this is a stance that I love having and I still feel the need to post against the oppression of black people but on this side of Twitter, so much I hear “Mayo monkeys” “I hate all white people” and even though it is supposedly a joke it really hurts me and makes me want to end it all.

Permanent brain damage from overdose?,"So about a week ago I was having a really bad time with life. I decided to try to kill myself. I have (had) a prescription for ativan. I took ~12mg and also drank 3 mikes hard lemonades. I remember finishing the last mike, and next thing I remember was being in the hospital. From what I gathered from my family and boyfriend is that I ODed around 2pm and was found around 4:30pm. Apparently I was somewhat unresponsive when I was found in the woods and I had almost aspirated on my own vomit. Apparently I had my stomach pumped as well.

Anyways, after I woke up in the hospital, I had really bad brain fog, was hallucinating, and had just about zero sense of balance and coordination. It has now been 8 days since my overdose, and I am still having issues with my memory, hallucinations, and coordination and balance. Does anyone know if taking that much ativan mixed with alcohol can cause brain/CNS damage? Are these effects temporary or permanent? I was not told much at the hospital. My mom was the only one allowed to visit me and she isn't a very reliable source (she's a little unstable)",noot333,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgctv6/permanent_brain_damage_from_overdose/,week ago wa really bad time life decided try kill prescription ativan took 12mg also drank 3 mike hard lemonade remember finishing last mike next thing remember wa hospital gathered family boyfriend oded around 2pm wa found around 4 30pm apparently wa somewhat unresponsive wa found wood almost aspirated vomit apparently stomach pumped well anyways woke hospital really bad brain fog wa hallucinating zero sense balance coordination ha 8 day since overdose still issue memory hallucination coordination balance doe anyone know taking much ativan mixed alcohol cause brain cns damage effect temporary permanent wa told much hospital mom wa one allowed visit reliable source little unstable,permanent brain damage overdose,ot 333,1096,37,ot 333 week ago wa really bad time life decided try kill prescription ativan took 12mg also drank 3 mike hard lemonade remember finishing last mike next thing remember wa hospital gathered family boyfriend oded around 2pm wa found around 4 30pm apparently wa somewhat unresponsive wa found wood almost aspirated vomit apparently stomach pumped well anyways woke hospital really bad brain fog wa hallucinating zero sense balance coordination ha 8 day since overdose still issue memory hallucination coordination balance doe anyone know taking much ativan mixed alcohol cause brain cns damage effect temporary permanent wa told much hospital mom wa one allowed visit reliable source little unstable permanent brain damage overdose

My own family treats me like an annoyance and has been against any hobby I have ever had. ""You suck at music and singing"" and they throw away my instruments, ""don't try with art you need to focus on acedemics, your brother is better anyways"", and recently the only thing that has kept me going was twitch streaming.

My suicide note.,"I know it doesn’t seem right but I actually am in my right frame of mind at the time of this note. I have tried to commit suicide before and honestly I couldn’t tell you why. It was more emotional. But now thanks to years of therapy and ssri’s I can tell you. It’s been 3 years. And I tried, I actually listened to you all and believed it would get better. If anything I have regressed, gained huge amounts of weight, lost jobs, lost friends and a general sense of self worth. 
Everyone is moving on. Having kids, getting married, buying houses, making strides in their careers. And I’m in the same place I was 3 years ago. There is no future. I don’t get a happy ending, I don’t feel fulfilled. This is life for me. 

Dear God, 
I really fucking tried. I thought you cared about me. Well I think it’s a lie. You care about some people, special people. And I’m not one of them.

Dear Mommy, 
Your support meant a lot. And I wanted to die last year but I didn’t want to add to the grandma and auntie Gogo of it all. It would be too much death. You did your best. 

Dear dada, 
I forgive you. You pushed me and wanted me to succeed and I get it. I just wasn’t as strong as you and I’m sorry. I know you had a rough life and you came out stronger but I just couldn’t. I really tried though. I’m sorry my best wasn’t enough. 

Dear Brieanna, 
Well you’re the oldest now, even though you’ve been that for the past few years. You’ll be better at it than me. You’re strong. In Remembrance of me, please be kind to others no matter who. 

Dear Brielle, 
You have no trouble bouncing between anger and happiness but remember to cry. I know you hated that I was so sensitive but I don’t want you to bottle it up. Don’t end up like me. 

Dear Brina, 
You’re so tough and funny I’m jealous. I was so insecure and awkward at your age, it makes me happy to know you’re better off than I was. Stay fierce. 

Dear Jeremy, 
My only baby. I treated you like you were my son and honestly I feel like you’re the most like me personality wise. Life is hard for people like us. And people won’t understand how much you feel and the depth of your emotion. Feel it anyway. 

Dear friends, 
To my online friends thank you. You encouraged me when no one else would. You were friends to me from hundreds of miles away and never made me feel alone. I survived as long as I did because of you. To those I never got to hug in person I regret that the most. 
 To my in person friends, let’s be honest here. There weren’t many of you and we hung out and talked very rarely. I always felt like something held us back. Maybe it was me, maybe I was the bad friend or off putting or weird. And for that I’m sorry, I always wanted a close friend group and try as I did to make it happen it never lasted. But that’s life for me I think. Some things just aren’t meant to be.

Dear Charlie, 
I know you can’t read, although who knows, it would be very much like you to know how and just play dumb. I love you so much, and honestly maybe I died so I wouldn’t live without you in my life, you were the best boy and you helped me on those bad days and nights. You knew. Be a good boy for those I left behind. 


Dear people who didn’t like me, 

(I’m assuming there’s a lot) I thought about you quite often, the ones I knew and the ones I suspected and those I had no idea about. Odds are you really don’t care one way or another about me but for those who loathed me I guess today is a happy day for you. To my arch nemesis, I’ll see you in Hell. Jk who knows 


Dear John, 
I hope I made you laugh with that last one. Honestly i think you were my only true friend in the world. I told you everything and anything and you accepted me. The love you showed me on my worst day and my best day was the same. Infinite. I know you held back from me and honestly it’s probably because you suspected this day would come. I want you to know if anyone could have stopped me, and you succeeded on multiple occasions, it would have been you. And maybe if we lived together you could have but I guess it wasn’t in the cards. I’m sorry we never got married, I’m sorry we never got to see Paris, I’m sorry we never opened a restaurant, and I’m sorry we never got to take Charlie to the beach. We had so many plans and in over 5 years of dating we probably accomplished 2. Life has been hard and I know this makes it even worse for you. But know I couldn’t take it anymore. The purgatory of waiting of the unknown. The endless someday soon. I was barely holding on as it was. I could tell you to move on, live our dreams for us but honestly you probably won’t. And that’s okay. As long as you do something. And hey how great am I, no matter how happy you get you’ll always have a tragic past to use for your stand up comedy. Life was never going to get better for me but it can for you. Stop being so damn scared of living, and leave your room. Do it for me. 

I’m sorry for your loss everyone. I truly am. 

For the very last time and also forever,

My wife wants a divorce..," 

My wife and I are splitting up. Its because of years of me choosing weed over my family like my sons birthday, my anniversary, all of it... It's all my fault. The women that I spent 5 years of my life married too, had a wonderful unbelievably amazing daughter and son with.. Idk how to do this.

All I want is to kill myself. I don't want to think about.. splitting up material bullshit.. or .. fuck man.. or even how we're suppose to talk to each other now. I'm madly in love with this woman but.. somehow it wasn't enough to overcome my own selfishness. I've ruined the only thing I've ever wanted, a real family. I don't know where I'm suppose to go.. how do I drive now that I'm leaving her with the car, the bills, the kids, my heart, fuck... everything is with this woman. I couldn't stand to see her happy with someone else, but I do wish her nothing but happiness. I just.. she's been kissing me and I was just told its because I want it. She doesn't even want to kiss me. I really fucked up. I don't know where to go from here. I don't know if I want more than what I've already taken in this life. I've struggled with chronic depression and suicidal thoughts my entire life, and right when I think that I'm finally over it.. this happens. I am the bad guy here. I know I am and no matter how many tears I cry it'll never fix what I once had.

If I'm not going to kill myself, then I need to know how to do this. She works 40 hours during the week on days, and I work 2 12's on saturday and sunday so money isn't exactly easy to come by. What about my babies.. how does the mother of my children sustain their living situation and her own without me around to watch them while she works. I'm sure she'll find a way. I'm just really scared.

I dont want to do this. I don't want this.. I'm so sorry.",Reduric,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgchse/my_wife_wants_a_divorce/,wife splitting year choosing weed family like son birthday anniversary fault woman spent 5 year life married wonderful unbelievably amazing daughter son idk want kill want think splitting material bullshit fuck man even suppose talk madly love woman somehow enough overcome selfishness ruined thing ever wanted real family know suppose go drive leaving car bill kid heart fuck everything woman stand see happy someone else wish nothing happiness kissing wa told want even want kiss really fucked know go know want already taken life struggled chronic depression suicidal thought entire life right think finally happens bad guy know matter many tear cry never fix going kill need know work 40 hour week day work 2 12 saturday sunday money exactly easy come baby doe mother child sustain living situation without around watch work sure find way really scared dont want want sorry,wife want divorce,red uric,1810,25,red uric wife splitting year choosing weed family like son birthday anniversary fault woman spent 5 year life married wonderful unbelievably amazing daughter son idk want kill want think splitting material bullshit fuck man even suppose talk madly love woman somehow enough overcome selfishness ruined thing ever wanted real family know suppose go drive leaving car bill kid heart fuck everything woman stand see happy someone else wish nothing happiness kissing wa told want even want kiss really fucked know go know want already taken life struggled chronic depression suicidal thought entire life right think finally happens bad guy know matter many tear cry never fix going kill need know work 40 hour week day work 2 12 saturday sunday money exactly easy come baby doe mother child sustain living situation without around watch work sure find way really scared dont want want sorry wife want divorce

First time poster . Desperate,"I have this cloud hanging over me that seems like it’s getting darker &amp; darker . I’m diagnosed with MDD &amp; time isn’t making anything easier . 


All I do is cry— cry at work, cry at home , cry in the car, etc. The thought of suicide was like a seed that keeps growing at the same rate as the dark cloud I mentioned. I have constant anxiety — I don’t have a sleep routine , I don’t eat consistently &amp; it seems like the only time I can attempt to rest is under my girlfriend but I just feel like I’m dragging her down with me.

I don’t have a good relationship with my parents &amp; im just really scared atp. I feel hopeless , &amp; it feels bottomless &amp; im so exhausted. I’m so tired . My brain doesn’t allow me to do anything outside of my thoughts. I don’t even know who I am or who I’m supposed to pretend to be anymore. I want to break free of it but I can’t .

How do I get over that I'm just not important to anybody?,"I'm tired of trying to give myself reasons to live I'm tired of trying to find excuses to live because honestly, I look at my family without me being in the picture and see that they will always be happy versus me being in the picture and seeing complete unhappiness, I have a girlfriend and she loves me dearly but I feel like sometimes I'm just a waste of space and energy.

"One of my online friend ""disappeared""","So, one of my friend that is long time depressed has been missing online for some times now, he had already disappeared for a week but came back.

This time we are more concerned about it, because he deleted his discord account without talking to anyone,etc... and none of us have any news. (it's been like a month now)

We have really little information about his real life information, we know his country, approximate location.

What can we do to ""know"" if something happened ? it's a really vague post but i don't know where to start",Calinychta,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jfvpgu/one_of_my_online_friend_disappeared/,one friend long time depressed ha missing online time already disappeared week came back time concerned deleted discord account without talking anyone etc none u news like month really little information real life information know country approximate location know something happened really vague post know start,one online friend disappeared,cali nyc ht,537,37,cali nyc ht one friend long time depressed ha missing online time already disappeared week came back time concerned deleted discord account without talking anyone etc none u news like month really little information real life information know country approximate location know something happened really vague post know start one online friend disappeared
:((,I don’t wanna work to live my shitty life. I’d much rather be a lazy piece of shit that stays at home all the time. I’m so jealous of people who make money doing something they enjoy. I’d love to make money playing video games with friends but I know it won’t happen. I hate people. Too bad I’m not rich. That would solve a lot of my problems. Yeah I’m lazy but I also have overwhelming anxiety that stops me from going out and doing things. I had a job interview today and basically got the job but I absolutely can’t take working. That’s why I quit my last job. Too bad I probably wouldn’t qualify for disability checks. I’m definitely too mentally ill to work any job. Because of this and many other things I will soon end my life. I’m sorry I have such hatred towards people I can’t help it. I didn’t ask to be created. I just wanna at least live comfortably in the safety of my own room. Even then life would still be very painful. :(,human_salamander12,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jgcdir/_/,wanna work live shitty life much rather lazy piece shit stay home time jealous people make money something enjoy love make money playing video game friend know happen hate people bad rich would solve lot problem yeah lazy also overwhelming anxiety stop going thing job interview today basically got job absolutely take working quit last job bad probably qualify disability check definitely mentally ill work job many thing soon end life sorry hatred towards people help ask created wanna least live comfortably safety room even life would still painful,,human salamander 12,939,3,human salamander 12 wanna work live shitty life much rather lazy piece shit stay home time jealous people make money something enjoy love make money playing video game friend know happen hate people bad rich would solve lot problem yeah lazy also overwhelming anxiety stop going thing job interview today basically got job absolutely take working quit last job bad probably qualify disability check definitely mentally ill work job many thing soon end life sorry hatred towards people help ask created wanna least live comfortably safety room even life would still painful

I’m finally ready (I think),"I think I’m ready to go now, I’m looking for a reason not to. I don’t have a bad life, I go to a good school, have a decent amount of friends. my dad tells me all he time how selfish suicide is. I just can’t live like this anymore, it’s not right. It’s not healthy. It’s selfish to keep forcing those around me to watch me suffer, and not do anything about it. I lost my chance at love, I lost my chance at a perfect life with him because I was stupid and naive. I don’t want it anymore without him, so why live? I’m writing a book for him, because it’s all I have left to do with my life. I’ve thought about this a lot, and I’m going to make it look like an accident, so nobody but him will know the truth.
